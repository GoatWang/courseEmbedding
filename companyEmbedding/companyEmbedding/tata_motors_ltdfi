The first-generation(1998–07) Tata Indica; one of the best-selling cars in the history of the Indian automobile industry






Tata Bolt


Tata entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz of Germany. After years of dominating the commercial vehicle market in India, Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 by launching the Tata Sierra, a multi utility vehicle. Tata subsequently launched the Tata Estate (1992; a station wagon design based on the earlier 'TataMobile' (1989), a light commercial vehicle), the Tata Sumo (1994; LCV) and the Tata Safari (1998; India's first sports utility vehicle).
Tata launched the Indica in 1998, the first fully indigenous Indian passenger car. Although initially criticized by auto analysts, its excellent fuel economy, powerful engine, and an aggressive marketing strategy made it one of the best-selling cars in the history of the Indian automobile industry. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, was a major improvement over the previous version and quickly became a mass favourite. Tata Motors also successfully exported large numbers of the car to South Africa. The success of the Indica played a key role in the growth of Tata Motors.[6]

It is the second-largest heavy commercial vehicle manufacturer in South Korea and was acquired by Tata Motors in 2004. The principal reasons behind the acquisition were to reduce Tata's dependence on the Indian commercial vehicle market (which was responsible for around 94% of its sales in the MHCV segment and around 84% in the light commercial vehicle segment) and expand its product portfolio by leveraging on Daewoo's strengths in the heavy-tonnage sector.
Tata Motors has jointly worked with Tata Daewoo to develop trucks such as Novus and World Truck and buses including GloBus and StarBus. In 2012, Tata began developing a new line to manufacture competitive and fuel-efficient commercial vehicles to face the competition posed by the entry of international brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Navistar into the Indian market.[34]

Notable vehicles[edit]
Tata Nano[edit]
Main article: Tata Nano




Tata Nano is often cited as the world's most affordable car


The Nano was launched in 2009 as a city car intended to appeal as an affordable alternative to the section of the Indian populace that is primarily the owner of motorcycles and has not bought their first car. Initially priced at ₹100,000 (US$1,500), the vehicle attracted a lot of attention for its relatively low price.
Tata Ace[edit]
Main article: Tata Ace




Tata Ace was India's first mini truck


Tata Ace, India's first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport. By October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[50] By 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors.
Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[51] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[52]
Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries' Global Electric Motorcars division.[53] In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel and Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta.
Tata 407[edit]
Main article: Tata 407
The Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[54] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales.

Tata Ace[edit]
Main article: Tata Ace




Tata Ace was India's first mini truck


Tata Ace, India's first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport. By October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[50] By 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors.
Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[51] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[52]
Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries' Global Electric Motorcars division.[53] In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel and Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta.
Tata 407[edit]
Main article: Tata 407
The Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[54] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales.

Tata entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz of Germany. After years of dominating the commercial vehicle market in India, Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 by launching the Tata Sierra, a multi utility vehicle.

Tata Nano[edit]
Main article: Tata Nano




Tata Nano is often cited as the world's most affordable car


The Nano was launched in 2009 as a city car intended to appeal as an affordable alternative to the section of the Indian populace that is primarily the owner of motorcycles and has not bought their first car. Initially priced at ₹100,000 (US$1,500), the vehicle attracted a lot of attention for its relatively low price.
Tata Ace[edit]
Main article: Tata Ace




Tata Ace was India's first mini truck


Tata Ace, India's first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport. By October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[50] By 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors.
Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[51] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[52]
Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries' Global Electric Motorcars division.[53] In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel and Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta.
Tata 407[edit]
Main article: Tata 407
The Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[54] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales.

	PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT SUMMARY



	This summary highlights information more fully described elsewhere in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus. You
	should read carefully this entire prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus including the risks set forth under the caption Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk Factors included in the Annual Report, which is
	incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus, and the risks set forth under the caption Risk Factors in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus, as well as the
	historical consolidated financial statements and the related notes incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus, before deciding to invest in our securities.



	Tata Motors Limited



	We are the largest
	automobile manufacturer in India in terms of revenue generated during Fiscal 2014. We estimate that over eight million vehicles produced by us are in operation in India as of the date hereof. We have a substantial presence in India and also have
	global operations in connection with production and sale of Jaguar and Land Rover premium brand passenger vehicles.


	We were incorporated
	on September 1, 1945 as a public limited liability company under the Indian Companies Act VII of 1913 as Tata Locomotive and Engineering Company Limited and we received a certificate of commencement of business on November 20, 1945. Our
	name was changed to Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited on September 24, 1960, and to Tata Motors Limited on July 29, 2003. Tata Motors Limited is incorporated and domiciled in India. We commenced operations as a steam
	locomotive manufacturer. This business was discontinued in 1971. Since 1954, we have been manufacturing automotive vehicles. The automotive vehicle business commenced with the manufacture of commercial vehicles under financial and technical
	collaboration with Daimler-Benz AG (now Daimler AG) of Germany. This agreement ended in 1969. We produced only commercial vehicles until 1991, when we started producing passenger vehicles as well. Together with our consolidated subsidiaries we form
	the Tata Motors Group.


	In June 2008, we acquired the Jaguar Land Rover business from Ford Motor Company. Jaguar Land Rover is a global
	automotive business, which designs, manufactures and sells Jaguar luxury sedans and sports cars and Land Rover premium all-terrain vehicles as well as related parts, accessories and merchandise. The Jaguar Land Rover business has internationally
	recognized brands, a product portfolio of award-winning luxury performance cars and premium all-terrain vehicles, brand specific global distribution networks and research and development capabilities. As a part of our acquisition of the Jaguar Land
	Rover business, we acquired three major manufacturing facilities located in Halewood, Solihull and Castle Bromwich and two advanced design and engineering facilities located at Whitley and Gaydon, all in the United Kingdom, together with national
	sales companies in several countries.


	In September 2004, we became the first company from Indias automotive sector to be listed on
	the New York Stock Exchange. Our ADSs are traded on the NYSE under the symbol TTM. Our Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares are traded on the BSE under the codes 500570 and 570001, respectively, and the NSE under the symbols
	TATAMOTORS and TATAMTRDVR, respectively.


	As of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2014, our
	consolidated assets were Rs.2,367,382.0 million (approximately US$37,556.6 million), our consolidated revenues were Rs.1,946,822.1 million (approximately US$30,884.8 million) and our consolidated net income was Rs.112,970.3 million
	(approximately US$1,792.2 million). The U.S. dollar amounts in our consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement have been translated based on the fixing rate of US$1.00 = Rs.63.035 in the City of
	Mumbai on December 31, 2014 for cable transfers in Indian rupees as published by the Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India. See Certain Terms.

	Background and Growth Strategy



	As part of our growth strategy we seek to expand our product offerings and geographical presence, both globally as well as in India. These
	developments are expected to include:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the addition of more than 100 products (taking into account differing tonnage, power train combinations and variants) in our commercial vehicle business over the next three years;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the introduction of two or three new products each year in our passenger vehicle business;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the adoption of a new modular platform for vehicles from 2016-17 onwards;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the addition of more than 40 new products (taking into account differing variants and power train combinations) over the next five years in our Jaguar Land Rover business;




	 




	 


	


	 


	de-risking our Jaguar Land Rover business by setting up its own engine plant in the United Kingdom and a general increase in our manufacturing capacity in the United Kingdom;




	 




	 


	


	 


	an expansion of Jaguar Land Rovers operations in China, Brazil and potentially other markets;




	 




	 


	


	 


	investment in technology, including to enable compliance with increasingly stringent emission control requirements; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	expansion of commercial and passenger vehicle operations in Thailand, Indonesia and South Korea (through our existing manufacturing bases), as well as penetration of new export markets for our India business including
	Australia, the Philippines and Vietnam.




	In light of our global growth and expansion plans, it is expected that we will
	require significant capital expenditures amounting to an average of Rs. 40 billion (approximately US$637.6 million) per year for our Tata Motors business and GBP3.5-3.7 billion (approximately US$5.5-5.7 billion) per year for our Jaguar Land
	Rover business. While we endeavor to meet a significant portion of our aggregate capital expenditure through our consolidated cash flow from operations, we consider it prudent in light of the cyclical nature of our automobile operations, as
	evidenced by the recent economic downturn in India and its resulting negative impact on operating cash flow, to raise additional funds through the ADS Rights Offering.





	Use of Proceeds



	Assuming all of the new
	Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares sold in the Rights Offering are subscribed for at the subscription price of Rs.450 per new Ordinary Share and Rs.271 per A Ordinary Share, the net proceeds of the Rights Offering are
	expected to be approximately Rs.74,280 million (approximately US$1,183.1 million) after deduction of fees and expenses of approximately Rs.700 million (approximately US$11.1 million).


	The net proceeds are expected to be utilized towards:


	 




	 


	


	 


	funding expenditure towards plant and machinery;




	 




	 


	


	 


	funding expenditure relating to research and product development;




	 




	 


	


	 


	repayment in full or in part of certain long-term and short-term borrowings; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	general corporate purposes.




	See Use of Proceeds beginning on page S-38 of this
	prospectus supplement.

	We sold 11,813 and 11,925 Tata Motors passenger vehicles in January and February 2015 as compared to 8,816 and
	9,365 vehicles in January and February 2014, representing increases of 34% and 27% respectively.


	Our sales of Tata Motors light, medium
	and heavy commercial vehicles in February 2015 were 30,273 vehicles, representing a 7% increase over 28,187 vehicles in February 2014. However, sales of Tata Motors utility vehicles dropped by 43% to 1,481 vehicles in January 2015 and by 16% to
	2,011 vehicles in February 2015.


	Our Jaguar Land Rover business retailed 37,317 vehicles and 28,689 vehicles in January and February 2015
	respectively compared to 39,106 and 30,487 in the corresponding months in 2014, reflecting decline of 5% and 6% respectively. The decrease was largely due to lack of available Freelander inventory. As of February 28, 2015, on a cumulative basis our
	Jaguar Land Rover business had retailed 403,728 vehicles for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, as compared to 379,128 vehicles in the equivalent period in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, representing an increase of 6%.

	of the average turnover for three years. Subsequently, we and other car manufacturers filed a writ petition before the Delhi High Court challenging the constitutional validity of Section 22(3) and 27(b) of the Indian Competition Act under which

	SUMMARY OF THE RIGHTS OFFERING




	This summary highlights certain information contained elsewhere in this prospectus supplement. This summary does not contain all of the
	information that you should consider before deciding to subscribe the Rights. We urge you to read the entire prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus carefully, including the Risk Factors and Cautionary Note
	Regarding Forward-Looking Statements sections, along with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements.



	Pursuant to a shareholders resolution approved by way of postal ballot on March 3, 2015, authority was granted to our board of
	directors to determine the terms of the Rights Offering. Our board of directors approved the terms and conditions of the Rights Offering on March 25, 2015.


	The Rights Offering consists of the ADS Rights Offering and the Share Rights Offering. The ADS Rights Offering is being made to persons who
	are located in or reside in the United States. The Share Rights Offering is being conducted to persons with registered addresses in India. Assuming full subscription, the aggregate proceeds to us from the Rights Offering are Rs.74,280 million
	(approximately US$1,183.1 million) after deduction of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering.


	Assuming that the
	Rights Offering is fully subscribed, we will issue 150,644,759 new Ordinary Shares, including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs, and 26,530,290 new A Ordinary Shares, and expect to have 2,887,357,881 Ordinary Shares and 508,497,235
	A Ordinary Shares outstanding after the Rights Offering.







	The ADS Rights Offering



	 





	Issuer



	Tata Motors Limited, a company incorporated in India.




	 





	Eligible ADS Rights Holder



	Eligible ADS Rights Holders are registered holders or beneficial owners of ADSs as of the ADS record date that are located or reside in the United States.





	 





	 



	ADS Rights may not be distributed to holders or beneficial owners of ADSs that are not Eligible ADS Rights Holders. The ADS Depositary will not distribute the ADS Rights to registered holders of ADSs with registered addresses outside the United
	States which is referred to hereinafter as an Eligible Jurisdiction. The ADS Rights Agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the ADS Rights it holds for registered holders of ADSs that have registered addresses outside the Eligible
	Jurisdiction and will distribute the net cash proceeds from such sales (calculated on the basis of the weighted average of all sales of ADS Rights by the ADS Rights Agent and net of applicable fees, taxes and expenses) to such ADS holders after the
	end of the ADS Rights Offering subscription period.




	 





	 




	Brokers, banks and other nominees who hold ADSs for clients that are the beneficial owners of the ADSs and are located or reside outside of the Eligible Jurisdiction are instructed not to
	distribute the ADS Rights they may receive on behalf of such clients and, in lieu of such distribution of ADS Rights, the brokers, banks and other nominees are requested to sell the ADS Rights on behalf of such clients (either directly or through
	the ADS Rights Agent) and to distribute to such clients only the net cash proceeds from such sales.





	 





	 


	S-6







	Table of Contents







	 



	Brokers, banks and other nominees exercising ADS Rights on behalf of their clients will be asked to certify that such clients are Eligible ADS Rights Holders.





	 







	ADS Rights Offering



	Each ADS Right entitles the holder thereof to subscribe for one ADS at the ADS subscription price.





	 





	ADS Depositary



	Citibank, N.A.




	 







	ADS Rights Agent



	Citibank, N.A.




	 





	Excess Applications



	ADSs not taken up in terms of the Rights Offering will be available for allocation to holders of ADS Rights who validly exercise all of their ADS Rights and validly apply to purchase additional ADSs, as determined by the following formula:





	 




	 





	A  B = C,







	 




	 


	where




	 




	 




	A


	is equal to the maximum number of ADSs that may be subscribed by all ADS Rights holders (without giving effect to Excess Applications);




	 




	 




	B


	is equal to the number of ADSs subscribed by ADS Rights holders (without giving effect to Excess Applications); and




	 




	 




	C


	is equal to the maximum amount of ADSs available for allocation to holders who wish to apply for a greater number of ADSs than initially offered to them.




	 




	 


	Excess ADSs will be allocated, based on the number of ADS Rights validly exercised, to holders of ADS Rights who have exercised their ADS Rights in full and have validly applied for excess ADSs. Any fractional
	entitlements to excess ADSs will be disregarded.




	 





	Condition to the ADS Rights Offering



	See the Condition to the Rights Offering below.




	 




	 


	If the condition to the Rights Offering is not satisfied, we will refund the entire subscription amount received in Indian rupees in respect of the ADS Rights (including Excess Applications) to the ADS Rights Agent. The
	ADS Rights Agent will use commercially reasonable efforts to convert the Indian rupees received into U.S. dollars and to return the U.S. dollars from such conversion to the holders who validly exercise ADS Rights (which may be less than the
	estimated ADS subscription price and may be less than the deposit amount of US$39.42 per ADS subscribed).




	 







	ADS Record Date



	The record date for purposes of determining Eligible ADS Rights Holders is expected to be 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 7, 2015.





	 




	 


	S-7







	Table of Contents








	ADS ex-Rights Date



	The ex-Rights date for the ADSs is expected to be April 2, 2015.




	 





	 



	ADSs trading on the NYSE on and after that date are expected to trade without entitlement to ADS Rights.




	 







	ADS Rights Offering Subscription Period



	From 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on April 10, 2015 to 2:15 p.m., New York City time, on April 27, 2015.




	 





	ADS Subscription Price



	The estimated ADS subscription price is US$35.84 per ADS subscribed. The actual ADS subscription price per ADS will be the Share subscription price of Rs.2,250 for five Ordinary Shares translated into U.S. dollars on or about April 29, 2015 plus
	currency conversion fees and the depositarys issuance fee of US$0.05 per new ADS issued.





	 




	 


	The estimated ADS subscription price is the U.S. dollar equivalent of the share subscription price (adjusted to reflect the ADS-to-Ordinary Share ratio), using an exchange rate of Rs.62.7825 per U.S. dollar (the opening
	Indian rupee to U.S. dollar exchange rate published by Bloomberg L.P. at 7:29 a.m, New York City time, on March 27, 2015).

	A subscriber of the ADSs must deposit US$39.42 per ADS subscribed, which represents 110% of the estimated ADS
	subscription price, upon the exercise of each ADS Right.

	This additional amount over and above the estimated ADS subscription price is to increase the likelihood that the ADS Rights Agent will have sufficient funds to pay the actual ADS
	subscription price in light of a possible appreciation of the Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar between the date of this prospectus supplement and the end of the ADS Rights Offering subscription period and to pay currency conversion fees and the
	depositarys issuance fee of US$0.05 per new ADS. If the actual U.S. dollar price plus the issuance fee is less than the deposit amount, the ADS Rights Agent will refund such excess U.S. dollar subscription price to the subscribing ADS Rights
	holder without interest. If there is a deficiency, the ADS Rights Agent will not deliver the offered ADSs to such subscribing ADS Rights holder until it has received payment of the deficiency. The ADS Rights Agent may sell a portion of the new ADSs
	to cover the deficiency if not paid within 14 days from notice of the deficiency.




	 







	Transfer of ADS Rights



	Subject to compliance with relevant securities laws, the ADS Rights are freely transferable. The ADS Rights are expected to trade on the NYSE under the symbol TTM RT from 9:30 a.m., New York time, on April 10, 2015 until
	April 24, 2015. The NYSE has indicated that initially the ADS Rights may trade on a when-issued basis.




	 





	Exercise of ADS Rights



	Each holder or beneficial owner of ADS Rights may exercise all or only part of its ADS Rights, and may apply for excess ADSs (if it has validly exercised all of its ADS Rights).

	Subscriptions must be received by the ADS Rights Agent prior to
	2:15 p.m., New York City time, on April 27, 2015.






	 




	 


	S-8







	Table of Contents







	 


	Subject to the ADS Rights not being fully subscribed, holders of ADS Rights who timely exercise their ADS Rights and timely apply to purchase additional ADSs, may be allocated additional ADSs on a proportionate basis in
	respect of their excess applications. For further details, see The Rights OfferingSubscription by Holders of ADS RightsExcess Applications.




	 




	 


	Each beneficial owner of ADS Rights who wishes to exercise its ADS Rights should consult with the financial intermediary through which it holds its ADSs as to the manner, timing and form of exercise documentation,
	method of payment of the ADS deposit amount and other related matters required to effect such exercise. The financial intermediary with whom the subscription is made may require any person exercising ADS rights to pay or block the ADS deposit amount
	for the ADSs being subscribed in a deposit account as a condition to accepting the relevant subscription. You are urged to consult your financial intermediary without delay in case your financial intermediary is unable to act immediately.




	 




	 


	We provide further details on how to exercise ADS Rights (including guaranteed delivery procedures) under The Rights Offering.




	 





	Exercise of ADS Rights Irrevocable



	Any exercise of ADS Rights (including any application for Excess of ADS) will be irrevocable upon exercise and may not be canceled or modified after such exercise.




	 







	Fractional ADS Rights



	Fractional ADS Rights will not be issued. Fractional entitlements to ADS Rights will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and will lapse without compensation.




	 





	Unexercised ADS Rights



	ADS Rights that are not exercised prior to the end of the ADS Rights Offering subscription period will expire valueless without any compensation.




	 





	Delivery of Offered ADSs



	The ADS Depositary will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the ADS Rights it holds for registered holders of ADSs that have registered addresses outside the Eligible Jurisdiction and will distribute the net cash proceeds from such sales
	(calculated on the basis of the weighted average of all sales of ADS Rights by the ADS Rights Agent and net of applicable fees, taxes and expenses) to such ADS holders.





	 




	 


	Brokers, banks and other nominees, who receive ADS Rights on behalf of clients that are the beneficial owners of the ADSs and are located or reside outside of the Eligible Jurisdiction, are instructed not to distribute
	the ADS Rights they may receive on behalf of such clients and, in lieu of such distribution of ADS Rights, the brokers, banks and other nominees are requested to sell the ADS Rights on behalf of such clients (either directly or through the ADS
	Rights Agent) and to distribute to such clients only the net cash proceeds from such sales. Brokers, banks and other nominees exercising ADS Rights on behalf of their clients will be asked to certify that such clients are Eligible ADS Rights
	Holders.

	The ADSs subscribed for (including in respect of Excess Applications) are expected to be delivered to each ADS subscriber (by credit to its book-entry account at the financial intermediary through which it holds the ADS
	Rights or in the form of an uncertificated ADS if it is a holder registered directly with the ADS Depositary) on or around May 20, 2015.

	City time, on March 27, 2015).




	 







	Renunciation



	On March 30, 2015, we received approval from RBI for renunciation of Share Rights on the floor of BSE and NSE by (a) shareholders resident in India to any person resident outside India; and (b) shareholders resident outside India to any
	person who is either resident in or outside India, subject to the offer price to non-resident not being less than the offer price to a resident shareholder. However, non-resident Indian shareholders holding non-repatriable shares may only renounce
	the Rights in favor of residents or other non-resident Indians, and where an overseas corporate body, or OCB is involved, prior approval from RBI will be required. We provide further details on how to renounce Share Rights under The Rights
	Offering.





	 





	Exercise of Rights Entitlement



	Each holder of Share Rights may exercise all or only part of its Share Rights and may apply for excess Shares. Subscriptions must be received on or prior to the close of business hours in India on May 2, 2015. Dematerialized shareholders are
	urged to consult their Indian Depository or broker without delay regarding the procedure they need to follow for the acceptance, sale or renunciation of their rights offer entitlement without delay in case their Indian Depository or broker is unable
	to act immediately.




	 





	 



	We provide further details on how to exercise Share Rights under The Rights Offering.

	Condition to the Rights Offering




	If we do not receive the minimum subscription of 90% of the Rights Offering, on an aggregate basis including subscription by the Underwriters pursuant to their obligations with respect to devolved Shares, we shall refund the entire subscription
	amount to shareholders, which amounts are to be received by shareholders within 15 days from the expiration of the Rights Offering subscription period. If there is a delay in the refund of the subscription amount by more than eight days after such
	time, we shall pay interest for the period of delay, as prescribed under applicable Indian laws.




	 








	Participation by Tata Sons Limited and related entities




	Tata Sons Limited has undertaken to subscribe, on its own account, to the full extent of its entitlements in the Rights Offering, such commitment referred to hereinafter as the Assured Subscription. Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, Lady Tata Memorial
	Trust, Sir Ratan Tata Trust and JRD Tata Trust, referred to collectively as the Trusts, have confirmed that they will renounce all of their entitlements to participate in the Rights Offering in favor of Tata Sons Limited, because, among other
	factors, the Trusts would not be eligible to make such investment under the provisions of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950, as amended. As renunciation by the Trusts is being undertaken due to operation of law, it would not be considered as
	renunciation for the purposes of Regulation 10(4)(b)(i) of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 2011, referred to as the Takeover Regulations, and would be exempt from
	the open offer requirements under Regulation 10(4)(a) of the Takeover Regulations.

	Tata Sons Limited has agreed to subscribe, on its own account, to the full extent of any Share Rights that may be renounced in its favor by the Trusts.




	 








	Underwriting Agreement




	We have entered into an underwriting agreement, dated March 26, 2015, with the Underwriters, pursuant to which they have agreed to procure subscribers for, or otherwise subscribe for, any Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares
	that have not otherwise been subscribed for in the Rights Offering (including pursuant to the Assured Subscription), at a subscription price of Rs.450 per Ordinary Share and Rs.271 per A Ordinary Share. The underwriting agreement
	provides that the obligation of the several Underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of any Shares under the Right Offering are subject to certain conditions. See Plan of Distribution.





	 








	Use of Proceeds




	Assuming all of the new Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares are subscribed for as part of the Rights Offering, the net proceeds to the Company are expected to be approximately Rs.74,280 million (approximately US$1,183.1 million)
	after deduction of fees and expenses of approximately Rs.700 million (approximately US$11.1 million).

	Table of Contents








	RISK FACTORS




	Investing in the ADSs, the Shares and the Rights is speculative and is subject to a number of risks, including those risks which are
	described in this section. You should carefully consider the risks associated with any investment in the ADSs, the Shares or the Rights, our business and the industry in which we operate, including the following discussion of risks, as well as the
	other information set forth in or incorporated by reference into this prospectus. You should also carefully consider the risk factors described under Item 3. Key InformationD. Risk Factors beginning on page 3 of the Annual Report,
	which is incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement. Any of these risks could cause our future results to differ materially from expected results. The market price of our ADSs, the Shares and the Rights could decline due to any of
	these risks and investors could lose all or part of their investment.




	Risk associated with our Business and the Automotive Industry





	Deterioration in global economic conditions could have a material adverse impact on our sales, financial condition and results of operations.




	The automotive industry, and the demand for automobiles, are influenced by general economic conditions, including among other
	things, rates of economic growth, availability of credit, disposable income of consumers, interest rates, environmental and tax policies, safety regulations, freight rates and fuel and commodity prices. Negative trends in any of these factors
	impacting the regions where we operate could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	The Indian automotive industry is affected materially by the general economic conditions in India and around the world. Muted industrial
	growth in India in recent years, along with continuing high levels of inflation and interest rates, continue to pose risks to overall growth in this market. The automotive industry in general is cyclical and economic slowdowns in the recent past
	have affected the manufacturing sector, including the automotive and related industries in India. A continuation of negative economic trends or further deterioration in key economic metrics such as the growth rate, interest rates and inflation as
	well as reduced availability of financing for vehicles at competitive rates could materially and adversely affect our automotive sales in India and results of operations.


	In addition, the Indian automotive market and the Indian economy are influenced by economic and market conditions in other countries. Although
	economic conditions are different in each country, investors reactions to economic developments in one country can have adverse effects on the securities of companies and the economy as a whole, in other countries, including India. A loss of
	investor confidence in the financial systems of other emerging markets may cause volatility in Indian financial markets and indirectly, in the Indian economy in general. Any worldwide financial instability could also have a negative impact on the
	Indian economy, including the movement of exchange rates and interest rates in India. In the event global economic recovery is slower than expected, or if there is any significant financial disruption, this could have a material adverse effect on
	our cost of funding, portfolio of financing loans, business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and the trading price of our Shares and ADSs.


	Our Jaguar Land Rover business has significant operations in the United Kingdom, North America, continental Europe and China, as well as sales
	operations in many major countries across the globe. During Fiscal 2014, the automotive market in the United Kingdom and Europe continued to experience challenges. Confidence in financial markets and general consumer confidence have been further
	eroded by recent political tensions in North Africa, the Middle East and Ukraine, the imposition of economic sanctions against Russia, a possible exit by Greece from the Eurozone and concerns of an economic slowdown in China. Our strategy with
	respect to our Jaguar Land Rover operations, which includes new product launches and expansion in converging


	 


	S-17







	Table of Contents



	markets such as China, India, Russia and Brazil where we have experienced growth in recent years, may not be sufficient to mitigate the decrease in demand for our products in established markets
	which may have a significant negative impact on our financial performance. If automotive demand softens because of lower or negative economic growth in key markets, including China and Russia, or other factors, our financial condition and results of
	operations could be materially and adversely affected.




	Restrictive covenants in our financing agreements may limit our operations and financial
	flexibility and materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.




	Some of our
	financing agreements and debt arrangements set limits on or require us to obtain lender consent before, among other things, pledging assets as security. In addition, certain financial covenants may limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to
	incur additional liens. In the past, we have been able to obtain required lender consent for such activities. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such consents in the future. If our liquidity needs or growth plans
	require such consents and such consents are not obtained, we may be forced to forego or alter our plans, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.


	In the event we breach these financing agreements, the outstanding amounts due thereunder could become due and payable immediately or result
	in increased costs. A default under one of these agreements may also result in cross-defaults under other financing agreements and result in the outstanding amounts under such other financing agreements becoming due and payable immediately. This
	could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.


	In recent years, we have been in breach of
	financial covenants relating to our ratio of total outstanding liabilities to tangible net worth and to our debt service coverage ratio in various financing agreements. We requested and obtained waivers of our obligations from our lenders and
	guarantors to pay additional costs as a consequence of such breaches. These breaches have not resulted in an event of default in our financing agreements or the payment of penalties.


	If we are in breach of these financials covenants in Fiscal 2015, we plan to seek consents or waivers from our lenders or guarantors. However,
	we cannot assure you that we will succeed in obtaining consents or waivers in the future from our lenders or guarantors, or that our lenders and guarantors will not impose additional operating and financial restrictions on us, or otherwise seek to
	modify the terms of our existing financing agreements in ways that are materially adverse to us. In addition, future non-compliance with the financial covenants of our financing agreements may lead to increased costs for any future financings.
	See Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and ProspectsB. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesLoan Covenants in the Annual Report for more information on the loan covenants of our financing agreements.




	Exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.




	Our operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in countries in which we operate. We import capital equipment,
	raw materials and components from, manufacture vehicles in, and sell vehicles into, various countries, and therefore our revenue and costs have significant exposure to the relative movements of the GBP, the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Chinese
	Renminbi, the Russian Ruble, the Japanese Yen and the Indian rupee. In particular, the Indian rupee has declined significantly relative to the U.S. dollar in recent years. As of August 28, 2013, the value of the Indian rupee against the US dollar
	was Rs. 68.80 = US$1.00, following a depreciation of approximately 28.2%, as compared to Rs.53.65 = US $1.00 on May 1, 2013, based on the exchange rate for Indian rupees in the New York City for cable transfers payable in foreign currencies as
	certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for customs purposes. The exchange rate between Indian rupees and U.S. dollars was Rs. 62.7825 = US$1.00 based on the opening exchange rate as published by Bloomberg L.P. at 7:29 a.m., New York City
	time, on March 27, 2015.

	Moreover, we have outstanding foreign currency denominated debt and are sensitive to fluctuations
	in foreign currency exchange rates. We have experienced and expect to continue to experience foreign exchange losses and gains on obligations denominated in foreign currencies in respect of our borrowings and foreign currency assets and liabilities
	due to currency fluctuations.


	We also have interest-bearing assets (including cash balances) and interest bearing liabilities, which bear
	interest at variable rates, and are therefore exposed to changes in interest rates in the various markets in which we borrow. Although we manage our interest and foreign exchange exposure through use of financial hedging instruments such as forward
	contracts, swap agreements and option contracts, higher interest rates and a weakening of the Indian rupee against major foreign currencies significantly increase our cost of borrowing, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
	condition, results of operations and liquidity.




	Intensifying competition could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition and
	results of operations.




	The global automotive industry is highly competitive and competition is likely to further intensify in
	light of continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Competition is especially likely to increase in the premium automotive categories as each market participant intensifies its efforts to retain its position in
	established markets while also expanding in emerging markets, such as China, India, Russia, Brazil and parts of Asia. The factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and time to introduce new products, ability to
	control costs, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, environmental impact and perception thereof, customer service and financing terms. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the global automotive industry in
	the future.


	We also face strong competition in the Indian market from domestic as well as foreign automobile manufacturers. Improving
	infrastructure and robust growth prospects compared to other mature markets have attracted a number of international companies to India either through joint ventures with local partners or through independently owned operations in India.
	International competitors bring with them decades of international experience, global scale, advanced technology and significant financial resources. Consequently, domestic competition is likely to further intensify in the future. There can be no
	assurance that we will be able to implement our future strategies in a way that will mitigate the effects of increased competition in the Indian automotive industry.


	Designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in manufacturing, machinery, research
	and development, product design, engineering, technology and marketing in order to meet both consumer preferences and regulatory requirements. If our competitors consolidate or enter into other strategic agreements such as alliances, they may be
	able to take better advantage of economies of scale. We believe that competitors may be able to benefit from the cost savings offered by consolidation or alliances, which could adversely affect our competitiveness with respect to those competitors.
	Competitors could use consolidation or alliances as a means of enhancing their competitiveness (including through the acquisition of technology), which could also materially reduce our sales as well as materially and adversely affect our business,
	financial condition and results of operations.




	Our future success depends on our ability to satisfy changing customer demands by offering
	innovative products in a timely manner and maintaining such products competitiveness and quality.




	Our competitors may gain
	significant advantages if they are able to offer products satisfying customer needs earlier than we are able to, which may materially and adversely impact our sales and profitability. Unanticipated delays or cost overruns in implementing new product
	launches, expansion plans or capacity enhancements could also materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.


	Customer preferences especially in many of the developed markets appear to be moving in favor of more fuel efficient and environmentally
	friendly vehicles. Furthermore, in many countries there has been significant


	 


	S-19







	Table of Contents



	pressure on the automotive industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In many markets these preferences are driven by increasingly stringiest government regulations, rising fuel prices and
	customers environmental considerations. Our business and operations may be significantly impacted if we experience delays in developing products that reflect changing customer preferences, especially in the premium automotive category. In
	addition, a deterioration in the quality of our vehicles could force us to incur substantial costs and damage our reputation. There can be no assurance that the market acceptance of our future products will meet our sales expectations, in which case
	we may be unable to realize the intended economic benefits of our investments and our revenues and profitability may decrease materially.


	Private and commercial users of transportation increasingly use modes of transportation other than the automobile, especially in connection
	with increasing urbanization. The reasons for this include the rising costs related to automotive transport of people and goods, increasing traffic density in major cities and environmental awareness. Furthermore, the increased use of car sharing
	concepts and other innovative mobility initiatives facilitates access to other methods of transport, thereby reducing dependency on the private automobile altogether. A change in consumer preferences away from private automobiles would have a
	material adverse effect on our general business activity and on our sales, financial position and results of operations as well as prospects.


	To stimulate demand, competitors in the automotive industry have offered customers and dealers price reductions on vehicles and services,
	which has led to increased price pressures and sharpened competition within the industry. As a provider of numerous high-volume models, our profitability and cash flows are significantly affected by the risk of rising competitive and price
	pressures. Special sales incentives and increased price pressures in the new car business also influence price levels in the used car market, with a negative effect on vehicle resale values. This may have a negative impact on the profitability of
	the used car business in our dealer organization.




	We are subject to risks associated with product liability, warranties and recalls.




	We are subject to risks and costs associated with product liability, warranties and recalls relating to defective products, parts or
	after-sales services, including by generating negative publicity, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These events could also require us to expend considerable resources in
	correcting these problems and could significantly reduce demand for our products. We may also be subject to class actions or other large scale product liability or other lawsuits in various jurisdictions where we have a significant presence.




	We are subject to risk associated with the automobile financing business.




	We are subject to risks associated with our automobile financing business in India. In the nine months ended December 31, 2014, the market
	share of our automobile financing business, which supports sales of our vehicles, decreased from the same period in 2013. Any default by our customers or inability to repay installments as due could materially and adversely affect our business,
	financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.


	The sale of our commercial and passenger vehicles is heavily dependent on fund
	availability for our customers. Rising delinquencies and early defaults has contributed to a reduction in automobile financing, which has had an adverse effect on fund availability for potential customers. This reduction in available financing may
	continue in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.


	Jaguar Land
	Rover has consumer finance arrangements in place with local providers in a number of key markets. Any reduction in the supply of available consumer financing for purchase of new vehicles could create


	 


	S-20







	Table of Contents



	additional pressures to increase marketing incentives in order to maintain demand for our vehicles, which could materially reduce our sales and net income. Furthermore, Jaguar Land Rover also
	offers residual value guarantees on the leases of certain vehicles in some markets. Any significant declines in used car valuations could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition and results of operations.


	Over time, and particularly in the event of any credit rating downgrade, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory changes or
	otherwise, we may need to reduce the amount of financing receivables we originate, which could severely disrupt our ability to support the sale of our vehicles.




	Underperformance of our distribution channels and supply chains may have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition and results of
	operations.




	Our products are sold and serviced through a network of authorized dealers and service centers across our domestic
	market, and a network of distributors and local dealers in the international markets. We monitor the performance of our dealers and distributors and provide them with support to enable them to perform to our expectations. There can be no assurance,
	however, that these expectations will be met. Any under performance by our dealers or distributors could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition and results of operations.


	We rely on third parties to supply us with the raw materials, parts and components used in the manufacture of our products. Furthermore, for
	some of these parts and components, we are dependent on a single source of supply. Our ability to procure supplies in a cost effective and timely manner is subject to various factors, some of which are not within our control. While we manage our
	supply chain as part of our vendor management process, any significant problems with our supply chain in the future could severely disrupt our business and materially reduce our sales and net income.


	Natural disasters and man-made accidents, adverse economic conditions, decline in automobile demand, and lack of access to sufficient
	financing arrangements, among others, could have a negative financial impact on our suppliers and distributors in turn impairing timely availability of components to us or increasing the costs of such components. Similarly, impairments to the
	financial position of our distributors may adversely impact our sales in some markets. In addition, if one or more of the other global automotive manufacturers were to become insolvent, this would severely disrupt our supply chains and may further
	materially reduce our sales and net income.


	In respect of our Jaguar Land Rover operations, as part of a separation agreement from Ford
	Motor Company, we have entered into long term supply agreements with Ford Motor Company and certain other third parties for critical components, which require us to purchase fixed quantity of parts through take or pay contracts. Any disruption of
	such services or invocation of take or pay contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	Increases in input prices may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	In the nine months ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, the consumption of raw materials, components and aggregates and purchase of products for
	sale constituted approximately 61.5% and 61.4% respectively, of our total revenues. Prices of commodity items used in manufacturing automobiles, including steel, aluminum, copper, zinc, rubber, platinum, palladium and rhodium have become
	increasingly volatile in recent years. Further price movements would closely depend on the evolving economic scenarios across the globe. While we continue to pursue cost reduction initiatives, an increase in price of input materials could severely
	impact our profitability to the extent such increase cannot be absorbed by the market through price increases and/or could have a negative impact on the demand.


	In addition, an increased price and supply risk could arise from the supply of rare and frequently sought-after raw materials for which demand
	is high, especially those used in vehicle electronics such as rare earths,


	 


	S-21







	Table of Contents



	which are predominantly found in China. Rare earth metal prices and supply remain uncertain. In the past, China has limited the export of rare earths from time to time. If we are unable to find
	substitutes for such raw materials or pass price increases on to customers by raising prices, or to safeguard the supply of scarce raw materials, our vehicle production, business and results from operations could be affected. Due to intense price
	competition and our high level of fixed costs, we may not be able to adequately address changes in commodity prices even if they are foreseeable. Increases in fuel costs also pose a significant challenge to automobile manufacturers worldwide,
	including us, especially in the commercial and premium vehicle segments where increased fuel prices have an impact on demand.




	Deterioration in the
	performance of any of our subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliates may materially and adversely affect our financial results.




	We have made and may continue to make capital commitments to our subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliates, and if the business or operations
	of any of these subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliates deteriorates, the value of our investments may decline substantially. We are also subject to risks associated with joint ventures and affiliates wherein we have only partial or joint
	control. Our partners may be unable, or unwilling, to fulfill their obligations or may experience financial difficulties which may materially reduce the value of our investments.




	The significant reliance of Jaguar Land Rover on key mature markets increases the risk of negative impact of reduced customer demand in those countries.




	Jaguar Land Rover, which contributes a large portion of our revenues, generates a significant portion of its sales in the United
	Kingdom, North American and continental European markets, where it derives three-quarters of its revenues. Sales declines in the premium car or all-terrain vehicle segments in which Jaguar Land Rover operates have been particularly severe. Although
	demand in those markets remains relatively strong, a decline in demand for Jaguar Land Rover vehicles in these markets may in the future significantly impair our business, financial position and results of operations. In addition, Jaguar Land
	Rovers strategy, which includes new product launches and expansion into growing markets, such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, may not be sufficient to mitigate a decrease in demand for Jaguar Land Rover products in mature markets in the
	future, which could have a significant adverse impact on our financial performance.




	We are subject to risks associated with growing our business
	through mergers and acquisitions.




	We believe that our acquisitions provide us opportunities to grow significantly in the global
	automobile markets by offering premium brands and products. Our acquisitions have provided us with access to technology and additional capabilities while also offering potential synergies. However, the scale, scope and nature of the integration
	required in connection with our acquisitions present significant challenges, and we may be unable to integrate the relevant subsidiaries, divisions and facilities effectively within our expected schedule. An acquisition may not meet our expectations
	and the realization of the anticipated benefits may be blocked, delayed or reduced as a result of numerous factors, some of which are outside our control.


	For example, we acquired the Jaguar Land Rover business from Ford Motor Company, in June 2008, and Jaguar Land Rover has become a significant
	part of our business and accounted for approximately 80% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2014. As a result of the acquisition, we are responsible for, among other things, the obligations and liabilities associated with
	the legacy business of Jaguar Land Rover. We cannot assure you that any legacy issues at Jaguar Land Rover or any other acquisition we have undertaken in the past or will undertake in the future would not have a material adverse effect on our
	business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our reputation and prospects.


	We will continue to evaluate growth
	opportunities through suitable mergers and acquisitions in the future. Growth through mergers and acquisitions involves business risks, including unforeseen contingent risks or latent

	business liabilities that may only become apparent after the merger or acquisition is completed. The key success factors will be seamless integration and effective management of the
	merged/acquired entity, retention of key personnel, as well as generating cash flow from synergies in engineering and sourcing, joint sales and marketing efforts, and management of a larger business. If any of these factors fails to materialize or
	if we are unable to manage any of the associated risks successfully, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.




	Our business is seasonal in nature and a substantial decrease in our sales during certain quarters could have a material adverse impact on our financial
	performance.




	The sales volumes and prices for our vehicles are influenced by the cyclicality and seasonality of demand for these
	products. The automotive industry has been cyclical in the past and we expect this cyclicality to continue. In the Indian market, demand for our vehicles generally peaks between January and March, although there is a decrease in demand in February
	just before release of the Indian fiscal budget. Demand is usually lean from April to July and picks up again in the festival season from September onwards, with a decline in December due to year-end.


	Our Jaguar Land Rover business is impacted by the semi-annual registration of vehicles in the United Kingdom where the vehicle registration
	number changes every six months. This leads to an increase in sales following the registration period as customers seek to purchase vehicles with fresh registrations, which in turn impacts the resale value of vehicles. Other markets such as the
	United States are influenced by introduction of new model year products which typically occurs in the autumn of each year. The automotive market in China tends to reflect higher demand for vehicles around the Chinese New Year. Demand in the western
	European automotive markets tends to be reduced during the summer and winter holidays. Furthermore, our cash flows are impacted by temporary shutdowns of three of our manufacturing plants in the United Kingdom during the summer and winter holiday
	seasons. The resulting sales and cash flow profile is reflected in our results of operations on a quarterly basis.




	We rely on licensing
	arrangements with Tata Sons Limited to use the Tata brand. Any improper use of the associated trademarks by our licensor or any other third parties could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
	operations.




	Our rights to our trade names and trademarks are a crucial factor in marketing our products. Establishment of the
	Tata word mark and logo mark in and outside India is material to our operations. We have licensed the use of the Tata brand from Tata Sons Limited, or Tata Sons. If Tata Sons, or any of their subsidiaries or affiliated
	entities, or any third party uses the trade name Tata in ways that adversely affect such trade name or trademark, our reputation could suffer damage, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
	and results of operations.




	Inability to protect or preserve our intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our business, financial
	condition and results of operations.




	We own or otherwise have rights in respect of a number of patents relating to the products we
	manufacture, which have been obtained over a period of years. In connection with the design and engineering of new vehicles and the enhancement of existing models, we seek to regularly develop new technical designs for use in our vehicles. We also
	use technical designs which are the intellectual property of third parties with such third parties consent. These patents and trademarks have been of value in the growth of our business and may continue to be of value in the future. Although
	we do not regard any of our businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, an inability to protect this intellectual property generally, or the illegal breach of some or a large group of our intellectual property
	rights, would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also be affected by restrictions on the use of intellectual property rights held by third parties and we may be held legally liable
	for the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others in our products.

	Our business and operations could be severely disrupted by labor unrest.




	All of our permanent employees in India, other than officers and managers, and most of our permanent employees in South Korea, and the United
	Kingdom, including certain officers and managers, in relation to our automotive business, are members of labor unions and are covered by our wage agreements, where applicable with those labor unions. In general, we consider our labor relations with
	all of our employees to be good. However, in the future we may be subject to labor unrest, which may delay or disrupt our operations in the affected regions, including the acquisition of raw materials and parts, the manufacture, sales and
	distribution of products and the provision of services. If work stoppages or lock-outs at our facilities or at the facilities of our major vendors occur or continue for a long period of time, our business, financial condition and results of
	operations could be materially and adversely affected.




	Our business could be negatively affected by the actions of activist shareholders.




	Certain of our shareholders may from time to time advance shareholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire
	control over our business. Campaigns by shareholders to effect changes at publicly-listed companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term shareholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring,
	increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or even sales of assets or the entire company, or by voting against proposals put forward by the board of directors and management of the company. If faced with actions by activist
	shareholders, we may not be able to respond effectively to such actions, which could be disruptive to our business.


	The current
	environment of increased shareholder activism could lead to new regulations or additional disclosure obligations, which could impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As an example, pursuant to the
	Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which contains significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions, the SEC has adopted additional rules and regulations in areas such as say on pay.
	Similarly, under applicable Indian laws, remuneration packages may in certain circumstances require shareholder approval. Our management and other personnel may be required to devote a substantial amount of time to such compliance initiatives. These
	rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	Our business and prospects could suffer if we lose one or more key personnel or if we are unable to attract and retain our employees.




	Our business and future growth depend largely on the skills of our workforce, including executives and officers, and automotive designers and
	engineers. The loss of the services of one or more of our personnel could impair our ability to implement our business strategy. In view of intense competition, any inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate our workforce could materially
	and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.




	Future pension obligations may prove more costly than
	currently anticipated and the market value of assets in our pension plans could decline.




	We provide post retirement and pension
	benefits to our employees, including defined benefit plans. Our pension liabilities are generally funded. However, lower returns on pension fund assets, changes in market conditions, interest rates or inflation rates, and adverse changes in other
	critical actuarial assumptions, may impact our pension liabilities or assets and consequently increase funding requirements, which could materially decrease our net income and cash flows.

	Any inability to manage our growing international business may materially and adversely affect our
	financial condition and results of operations.




	Our growth strategy relies on the expansion of our operations by introducing
	certain automotive products in markets outside India, including in Europe, China, Russia, Brazil, the United States, Africa and other parts of Asia. The costs associated with entering and establishing ourselves in new markets and expanding such
	operations may be higher than expected, and we may face significant competition in those regions. In addition, our international business is subject to many actual and potential risks and challenges, including language barriers, cultural differences
	and other difficulties in staffing and managing overseas operations, inherent difficulties and delays in contract enforcement and the collection of receivables under the legal systems of some foreign countries, the risk of non-tariff barriers, other
	restrictions on foreign trade or investment sanctions, and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws, rules and regulations. As a part of our global activities we may engage with third party dealers and distributors whom we do not
	control but who may nevertheless take actions that could have a material adverse impact on our reputation and business. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will not be held responsible for any activities undertaken by such dealers and
	distributors. If we are unable to manage risks related to our expansion and growth in other parts of the world, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.




	We have a limited number of manufacturing, design, engineering and other facilities and any disruption in the operations of those facilities could
	materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	We have manufacturing facilities and
	design and engineering centers located in India, the United Kingdom, China, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa and Brazil, and have established a presence in Indonesia. We could experience disruptions to our manufacturing, design and engineering
	capabilities for a variety of reasons, including, among others, extreme weather, fire, theft, system failures, natural catastrophes, mechanical or equipment failures and similar events. Any such disruptions could affect our ability to design,
	manufacture and sell our products and, if any of these events were to occur, there can be no assurance that we would be able to shift our design, engineering or manufacturing operations to alternate sites in a timely manner or at all. Any such
	disruption could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	We are exposed to operational risks,
	including risks in connection with our use of information technology.




	Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from
	inadequate or failed internal systems and processes, whether resulting from internal or external events. Such risks could stem from inadequacy or failures of controls within internal procedures, violations of internal policies by employees,
	disruptions or malfunctioning of information technology systems such as computer networks and telecommunication systems, other mechanical or equipment failures, human error, natural disasters or malicious acts by third parties. Any unauthorized
	access to or misuse of data on our information technology systems, human errors or technological or process failures of any kind could severely disrupt our operations, including our manufacturing, design and engineering processes, and could have a
	material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.




	Any failures or weaknesses in our internal controls could materially
	and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.




	As discussed in Item 15. Controls and
	Procedures in the Annual Report, upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls, we concluded that there was a material weakness such that our internal controls over financial reporting were not
	effective as at March 31, 2014. Although we have instituted remedial measures to address the material weakness identified and continually review and evaluate our internal control systems to allow management to report on the sufficiency of our
	internal controls, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Any such additional weaknesses or failure to adequately remediate any existing weakness could materially and
	adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations and our ability to accurately report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and reliable manner.

	Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us against all potential losses to which we may be
	subject, and this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	While we
	believe that the insurance coverage that we maintain is reasonably adequate to cover all normal risks associated with the operation of our business, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient, that any claim under our
	insurance policies will be honored fully or timely, or that our insurance premiums will not increase substantially. Accordingly, to the extent that we suffer loss or damage that is not covered by insurance or which exceeds our insurance coverage, or
	are required to pay higher insurance premiums, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.




	Impairment of intangible assets may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.




	Designing, manufacturing and selling vehicles is capital intensive and requires substantial investments in intangible assets like research and
	development, product design and engineering technology. We review the value of our intangible assets to assess on an annual basis whether the carrying amount matches the recoverable amount for the asset concerned based on underlying cash-generating
	units. We may have to take an impairment loss as of a current balance sheet date or future balance sheet date, if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the
	results of operations.




	We require certain approvals or licenses in the ordinary course of business and the failure to obtain or retain them in a
	timely manner, or at all, may adversely affect our operations.




	We require certain statutory and regulatory permits, licenses and
	approvals to carry out our business operations and applications for their renewal need to be made within certain timeframes. For some of the approvals which may have expired, we may have either made or are in the process of making an application for
	obtaining the approval or its renewal. While we have applied renewal for a few of these approvals, registrations and permits, we cannot assure you that we will receive these approvals and registrations in a timely manner or at all. We cannot assure
	that the approvals, licenses, registrations and permits issued to us would not be suspended or revoked in the event of non-compliance or alleged non-compliance with any terms or conditions thereof, or pursuant to any regulatory action. Further, if
	we are unable to renew or obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all, our business, financial conditions and operations may be adversely affected.




	The fund requirements in respect of the use of proceeds are based on management estimates and we have not commissioned an independent appraisal for the
	use of the proceeds of this Rights Offering. Furthermore, while we will appoint a monitoring agency to monitor the use of the proceeds of this Rights Offering, we have not entered into any definitive agreements to use the proceeds of this Rights
	Offering.




	We intend to use the proceeds of this Rights Offering for (a) funding capital expenditure towards plant and machinery;
	(b) funding expenditure relating to research and product development; (c) repayment in full or part, of certain long-term and short-term borrowings availed by us; and (d) general corporate purposes. The fund requirements are based on management
	estimates and we have not placed orders, obtained quotations or entered into definitive agreements for the substantial fund requirements mentioned in Use of Proceeds. Our actual fund requirements may be materially different from these
	management estimates and have not been appraised by any bank or financial institution. Furthermore, we have not identified the general corporate purposes for which we intend to utilize a portion of the proceeds of the Rights Offering. For further
	details, refer to Use of Proceeds. Our use of proceeds may differ from the contemplated uses set forth in this prospectus supplement, and there is no assurance that the ultimate use of proceeds would not results in a material adverse
	impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

	Political and Regulatory Risks





	Indias obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement could materially affect our business.




	Indias obligations under its World Trade Organization agreement could reduce the present level of tariffs on imports of components and
	vehicles. Reductions of import tariffs could result in increased competition, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.




	Compliance with new and current laws, rules, regulations and government policies regarding increased fuel economy, reduced greenhouse gas and other
	emissions, vehicle safety, taxes and pricing policies in the automotive industry may significantly increase our costs and materially decrease our net income.




	As an automobile company, we are subject to extensive governmental regulations regarding vehicle emission levels, noise and safety, and the
	levels of pollutants generated by our production facilities. These regulations are likely to become more stringent and higher compliance costs may significantly impact our future results of operations. In particular, the United States and Europe
	have stringent regulations relating to vehicle emissions. The proposed tightening of vehicle emissions regulations by the European Union will require significant costs for compliance. In addition, a number of further legislative and regulatory
	measures to address greenhouse emissions, including national laws and the Kyoto Protocol, are in various phases of discussions and implementation.


	In order to comply with current and future safety and environmental norms, we may have to incur additional costs to (i) operate and
	maintain our production facilities, (ii) install new emissions controls or reduction technologies, (iii) purchase or otherwise obtain allowances to emit greenhouse gases, (iv) administer and manage our greenhouse gas emissions program
	and (v) invest in research and development to upgrade products and manufacturing facilities. If we are unable to develop commercially viable technologies or otherwise unable to attain compliance within the time frames set by the new standards,
	we could face significant civil penalties or be forced to restrict product offerings drastically. Moreover, safety and environmental standards may at times impose conflicting imperatives, which pose engineering challenges and would, among other
	things, increase our costs. While we are pursuing the development and implementation of various technologies in order to meet the required standards in the various countries in which we sell our vehicles, the costs for compliance with these required
	standards could be significant to our operations and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	Imposition of any additional taxes and levies designed to limit the use of automobiles could significantly reduce the demand for our products
	as well as our sales and net income. Changes in corporate and other taxation policies as well as changes in export and other incentives offered by the various governments could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results
	of operations. For example, we benefit from excise duty exemptions for manufacturing facilities in the State of Uttarakhand in India and other incentives such as subsidies or loans from states where we have manufacturing operations. The Government
	of India has proposed a comprehensive national goods and services tax, or GST, regime that will combine taxes and levies by the central and state governments into one unified rate structure. While both the Government of India and other state
	governments of India have publicly announced that all committed incentives will be protected following the implementation of the GST, given the limited availability of information in the public domain concerning the GST, we are unable to provide any
	assurance as to this or any other aspect of the tax regime following implementation of the GST. The implementation of this rationalized tax structure may be affected by any disagreement between certain state governments, which could create
	uncertainty. The timeline of the proposed transition is uncertain as of the date of this prospectus supplement.


	Regulations in the areas
	of investments, taxes and levies may also have an impact on Indian securities, including our Shares and ADSs. For more information, see Item 4. Information on the CompanyB. Business OverviewGovernment RegulationsIndian
	TaxesGoods and Services Tax in the Annual Report.

	The Government of India has announced the union budget for the fiscal year 2016 and the Finance
	Bill 2015 has been tabled before the Indian parliament. The impact of these on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations is unclear at this point in time. We cannot assure you that any such impact would not materially reduce our
	revenues and net income.


	The PRC antitrust regulator, the Bureau of Price Supervision and Anti-Monopoly of the National Development and
	Reform Commission, or the NDRC, has launched an investigation into the pricing practices of more than 1,000 Chinese and international companies in the automotive industry, including Jaguar Land Rover and many of its competitors, in July 2014. The
	NDRC has reportedly imposed fines on certain of our international competitors as a result of anti-competitive practices pertaining to vehicle and spare part prices. In response to this investigation, we set up a process to review our pricing in
	China and announced, in July 2014, reductions in the manufacturers suggested retail price, or the MSRP, for our 5.0 liter V8 and V8 S, Range Rover, Range Rover Sport and Jaguar F-TYPE convertible models, effective from August 1, 2014. We
	also announced reductions in the price of certain of our spare parts, effective from September 1, 2014. These and other price reductions on our products sold in China may significantly reduce the revenues and profits generated by our operations
	in China and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our attempts to offset the potential decline in revenue and profits by increasing operational efficiencies and leveraging economies of scale (for
	example, through local production in China) may fail or not be as successful as expected. Furthermore, any regulatory action taken, or penalties imposed by, the NDRC or other authorities in China, may have significant severe reputational
	consequences on our business as well as our profitability and prospects.




	We may be materially and adversely impacted by political instability,
	wars, terrorism, multinational conflicts, natural disasters, fuel shortages/prices, epidemics and labor strikes.




	Our products are
	exported to a number of geographical markets and we plan to further expand our international operations in the future. Consequently, we are subject to various risks associated with conducting our business outside our domestic markets and our
	operations may be subject to political instability in those markets, wars, terrorism, regional or multinational conflicts, natural disasters, fuel shortages, epidemics and labor strikes. In addition, conducting business internationally, especially
	in emerging markets, exposes us to additional risks, including adverse changes in economic and government policies, unpredictable shifts in regulation, inconsistent application of existing laws, rules and regulations, unclear regulatory and taxation
	systems and divergent commercial and employment practices and procedures. Any significant or prolonged disruption or delay in our operations related to these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results
	of operations.




	Compliance with new and changing corporate governance and public disclosure requirements adds uncertainty to our compliance policies
	and increases our costs of compliance.




	We are subject to a complex and changing regime of laws, rules, regulations and standards
	relating to accounting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and SEC regulations, SEBI regulations, NYSE listing rules and Indian stock market listing regulations. New or changed laws, rules,
	regulations and standards may lack specificity and are subject to varying interpretations. Their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty
	regarding compliance matters and higher costs of compliance as a result of ongoing revisions to such governance standards. We are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. However, our efforts to comply
	with evolving laws, rules, regulations and standards in this regard have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management resources and time.


	The Companies Act, 2013 has brought into effect significant changes to the Indian company law framework, including to the provisions related
	to issue of capital, corporate governance norms, accounting policies and audit


	 


	S-28

	matters, related party transactions, the introduction of a provision allowing the initiation of class action suits in India against companies by shareholders or depositors, restrictions on the
	use of investment subsidiaries, prohibitions on loans to directors, insider trading and restrictions on forward dealing by directors and key management personnel. We are also required to spend, in each fiscal year, at least 2% of our average net
	profits during three immediately preceding fiscal years towards corporate social responsibility activities. To ensure compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013, we may need to allocate additional resources, which may increase our
	regulatory compliance costs and divert management attention.


	We may face challenges in interpreting and complying with the Companies Act
	due to limited jurisprudence. In the event, our interpretation of such provisions of the Companies Act differs from, or contradicts with, any judicial pronouncements or clarifications issued by the Government of India in the future, we may face
	regulatory actions or we may be required to undertake remedial steps. In addition, SEBI recently issued revised corporate governance guidelines which became effective from October 1, 2014. Pursuant to the revised guidelines, we are required to,
	among other things, ensure that there is at least one woman director on our board of directors at all times, establish a vigilance mechanism for directors and employees and reconstitute certain committees in accordance with the revised guidelines.
	The ultimate impact on us of these overlapping Indian legal and regulatory reforms are uncertain. Any increase in our compliance requirements or in our compliance costs may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial
	condition, and any perceived or actual non-compliance could also result in severe reputational damage as well as penalties or sanctions.




	Compliance
	with the SECs new rule for disclosures on conflict minerals may be time consuming and costly as well as result in reputational damage.




	Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the SEC has adopted a rule that applies to companies that use
	certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products, including certain products manufactured for them by third parties. The new rule requires companies that use conflict minerals in the production of their products to conduct
	due diligence as to whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries and requires companies to file certain information with the SEC about the use of these minerals. The deadline for the first
	conflict minerals report was June 2, 2014. We filed our first conflict minerals report on May 30, 2014. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with the new due diligence and disclosure requirements. In addition, depending on our
	findings or our inability to make reliable findings about the source of any possible conflict minerals that may be used in any products manufactured for us by third parties, our reputation could be harmed.



	Risks associated with Investments in an Indian Company





	Political changes in India could delay and/or affect the further liberalization of the Indian economy and materially and adversely affect economic
	conditions in India generally and our business in particular.




	Our business could be significantly influenced by economic policies
	adopted by the Government of India. Since 1991, successive governments have pursued policies of economic liberalization and financial sector reforms. The Government of India has at various times announced its general intention to continue
	Indias current economic and financial liberalization and deregulation policies. However, protests against such policies, which have occurred in the past, could slow the pace of liberalization and deregulation. The rate of economic
	liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies affecting foreign investment, currency exchange rates and other matters affecting investment in India could change as well. While we expect any new government to continue the liberalization
	of Indias economic and financial sectors and deregulation policies, there can be no assurance that such policies will be continued.


	The Government of India has traditionally exercised and continues to exercise influence over many aspects of the economy. Our business and the
	market price and liquidity of our ADSs, Shares and Rights may be affected


	 


	S-29







	Table of Contents



	by interest rates, changes in policy, taxation, social and civil unrest and other political, economic or other developments in or affecting India. A change in the Government of Indias
	economic liberalization and deregulation policies could disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally, and specifically those of our Company, as a substantial portion of our assets are located in India, and could have a material
	adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.




	Terrorist attacks, civil disturbances, regional conflicts and other acts of
	violence, particularly in India, may disrupt or otherwise adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our business and our profitability.




	India has from time to time experienced social and civil unrest and hostilities, including terrorist attacks and riots and armed conflict with
	neighboring countries. Events of this nature in the future could influence the Indian economy and could have a material adverse effect on our business as well as the market for securities of Indian companies, including our ADSs, Shares and Rights.




	Rights of shareholders under Indian law may be more limited than under the laws of other jurisdictions.




	Our Articles of Association, which include regulations applicable to our board of directors, and Indian law, govern our corporate affairs.
	Legal principles relating to these matters and the validity of corporate procedures, directors fiduciary duties and liabilities, and shareholders rights may differ from those that would apply to a company incorporated in another
	jurisdiction. Shareholders rights under Indian law may not be as extensive as shareholders rights under the laws of other countries or jurisdictions, including the United States. You may also have more difficulty in asserting your rights
	as a shareholder of our company than you would as a shareholder of a corporation organized in another jurisdiction.




	The market value of your
	investment may fluctuate due to the volatility of the Indian securities market.




	The Indian stock exchanges have, in the past,
	experienced substantial fluctuations in the prices of their listed securities. The Indian stock exchanges, including the BSE, have experienced problems that, if they continue or recur, could affect the market price and liquidity of the securities of
	Indian companies, including the Shares. These problems have included temporary exchange closures, broker defaults, settlement delays and strikes by brokers. In addition, the governing bodies of the Indian stock exchanges have from time to time
	imposed restrictions on trading in certain securities, limitations on price movements and margin requirements. Furthermore, from time to time disputes have occurred between listed companies and stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies, which in
	some cases may have had a negative effect on market sentiment.


	There may be a differing level of regulation and monitoring of the Indian
	securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and other participants, than in the United States. SEBI received statutory powers in 1992 to assist it in carrying out its responsibility for improving disclosure and other regulatory
	standards for the Indian securities markets. Subsequently, SEBI has prescribed regulations and guidelines in relation to disclosure requirements, insider dealing and other matters relevant to the Indian securities market. There may, however, be less
	publicly available information about Indian companies than is regularly made available by public companies in the United States.




	Investors may have
	difficulty enforcing judgments against us or our management.




	We are a limited liability company incorporated in India. The
	majority of our directors and executive officers are residents of India and substantially all of our assets and the assets of those persons are located in India. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the
	United States upon those persons or us. In addition, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in courts of the United States against those persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence, including judgments predicated solely upon U.S.
	federal securities laws. Moreover, it is unlikely that a court in India would award damages on the same basis as a

	foreign court if an action were brought in India or that an Indian court would enforce foreign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages as excessive or inconsistent with public policy.


	Section 44A of the Indian Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended, or the Civil Code, provides that where a foreign judgment has been
	rendered by a superior court (within the meaning of the section) in any country or territory outside of India which the Government of India has by notification declared to be a reciprocating territory, such foreign judgment may be enforced in India
	by proceedings in execution as if the judgment had been rendered by an appropriate court in India. However, the enforceability of such judgments is subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 13 of the Civil Code.


	Section 44A of the Civil Code is applicable only to monetary decrees not being in the nature of amounts payable in respect of taxes or
	other charges of a similar nature or in respect of fines or other penalties and does not include arbitration awards.


	If a judgment of a
	foreign court is not enforceable under Section 44A of the Civil Code as described above, it may be enforced in India only by a suit filed upon the judgment, subject to Section 13 of the Civil Code and not by proceedings in execution.
	Accordingly, as the United States has not been declared by the Government of India to be a reciprocating territory for the purposes of Section 44A, a judgment rendered by a court in the United States may not be enforced in India except by way
	of a suit filed upon the judgment.


	The suit must be brought in India within three years from the date of the judgment in the same manner
	as any other suit filed to enforce a civil liability in India. Generally, there are considerable delays in the disposition of suits by Indian courts.


	A party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in India is required to obtain prior approval from the RBI, under FEMA to repatriate any amount
	recovered pursuant to such enforcement. Any judgment in a foreign currency would be converted into Indian rupees on the date of judgment and not on the date of payment. See Enforcement of Civil Liabilities in the base prospectus for
	further details.




	We may be affected by competition law in India and any adverse application or interpretation of the Indian Competition Act could
	adversely affect our business.




	The Indian Competition Act regulates practices having an appreciable adverse effect on competition
	in the relevant market in India. Under the Indian Competition Act, any formal or informal arrangement, understanding or action in concert, which causes or is likely to cause an appreciable adverse effect on competition is considered void and results
	in imposition of substantial penalties. Furthermore, any agreement among competitors which directly or indirectly involves determination of purchase or sale prices, limits or controls production, shares the market by way of geographical area or
	number of subscribers in the relevant market or directly or indirectly results in bid-rigging or collusive bidding is presumed to have an appreciable adverse effect on competition in the relevant market in India and is considered void. The Indian
	Competition Act also prohibits abuse of a dominant position by any enterprise.


	On March 4, 2011, the Government of India issued and
	brought into force the combination regulation (merger control) provisions under the Indian Competition Act with effect from June 1, 2011. These provisions require acquisitions of shares, voting rights, assets or control or mergers or
	amalgamations that cross the prescribed asset and turnover based thresholds to be mandatorily notified to and pre-approved by the competition commission of India. In addition, on May 11, 2011, the CCI issued Competition Commission of India
	(Procedure for Transaction of Business Relating to Combinations) Regulations, 2011 (as amended) which sets out the mechanism for implementation of the merger control regime in India.


	The Indian Competition Act aims to, among others, prohibit all agreements and transactions which may have an appreciable adverse effect on
	competition in India. Consequently, all agreements entered into by us


	 


	S-31







	Table of Contents



	could be within the purview of the Indian Competition Act. Moreover, the CCI has extra-territorial powers and can investigate any agreements, abusive conduct or combination occurring outside
	India if such agreement, conduct or combination has an appreciable adverse effect on competition in India. However, the impact of the provisions of the Indian Competition Act on the agreements entered into by us cannot be predicted with certainty at
	this stage.


	The CCI has initiated an inquiry against us and other car manufacturers (collectively referred to hereinafter as the OEMs)
	pursuant to an allegation that genuine spare parts of automobiles manufactured by the OEMs were not made freely available in the open market in India and accordingly, anti-competitive practices were carried out by the OEMs. The CCI through its
	order, dated August 25, 2014, held that the OEMs had violated the provisions of Section 3 and Section 4 of the Indian Competition Act and imposed a penalty of 2% of the average turnover for three years. We and other car manufacturers have filed a
	writ petition before the Delhi High Court challenging the constitutional validity of Section 22(3) and 27(b) of the Indian Competition Act under which the order was passed and penalty imposed and the matter is currently pending before the Delhi High
	Court. However, we cannot assure you that we will succeed in our petition.


	If we are affected, directly or indirectly, by the application
	or interpretation of any provision of the Indian Competition Act, or any enforcement proceedings initiated by the competition commission of India, or any adverse publicity that may be generated due to scrutiny or prosecution by the competition
	commission of India or if any prohibition or substantial penalties are levied under the Indian Competition Act, it would materially and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.




	We will be required to prepare financial statements under Ind-AS (which is Indias convergence to IFRS). The transition to Ind-AS in India is very
	recent and there is no clarity on the impact of such transition on our Company.




	We currently prepare annual and interim financial
	statements under Indian GAAP. We will be required to prepare annual and interim financial statements under Indian Accounting Standard 101 First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards, or Ind-AS. On January 2, 2015, the Ministry of
	Corporate Affairs, Government of India, the MCA, announced the revised roadmap for the implementation of Ind-AS, and on February 16, 2015, released the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 (to be published in the Gazette of India)
	which will come into effect from April 1,2015.


	There is not yet a significant body of established practice on which to draw informing
	judgments regarding its implementation and application. Additionally, Ind-AS differs in certain respects from IFRS and therefore financial statements prepared under Ind-AS may be substantially different from financial statements prepared under IFRS.
	There can be no assurance that our financial condition, results of operation, cash flow or changes in shareholders equity will not be presented differently under Ind-AS than under Indian GAAP or IFRS. When we adopt Ind-AS reporting, we may
	encounter difficulties in the ongoing process of implementing and enhancing our management information systems. There can be no assurance that the adoption of Ind-AS will not adversely affect our financial conditions or results of operations.



	Risks associated with our Shares, ADSs and the Rights





	Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our ADSs and
	shares.




	Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. dollar will affect, among others things, the U.S.
	dollar equivalents of the price of the Shares in Indian rupees as quoted on the Indian stock exchanges and, as a result, may affect the market price of the ADSs and the Rights. These fluctuations will also affect the U.S. dollar equivalent of any
	cash dividends in Indian rupees received on the Shares represented by the ADSs and the dollar equivalent of the proceeds in Indian rupee of a sale of Shares in India.


	 


	S-32

	In particular, the Indian rupee has declined significantly relative to the U.S. dollar in recent
	years. As of August 28, 2013, the value of the Indian rupee against the US dollar was Rs. 68.80 = US$1.00, following a depreciation of approximately 28.2%, as compared to Rs.53.65 = US $1.00 on May 1, 2013, based on the exchange rate for Indian
	rupees in New York City for cable transfers payable in foreign currencies as certified by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for customs purposes. The exchange rate between Indian rupees and U.S. dollars was Rs. 62.7825 = US$1.00 based on the
	opening exchange rate as published by Bloomberg L.P. at 7:29 a.m., New York City time, on March 27, 2015.




	ADS holders have fewer rights than
	shareholders and must act through the depositary to exercise those rights.




	Although ADS holders have a right to receive any
	dividends declared in respect of the shares underlying the ADSs, they cannot exercise voting or other direct rights as a shareholder with respect to the shares underlying the ADSs. Citibank, N.A. as depositary is the registered shareholder of the
	deposited shares underlying our ADSs, and only Citibank, N.A. may exercise the rights of shareholders in connection with the deposited shares. The depositary will notify ADS holders of upcoming votes and arrange to deliver our voting materials to
	ADS holders only if requested by us. The depositary will try, in so far as practicable, subject to Indian laws and the provisions of our Articles of Association, to vote or have its agents vote the deposited securities as instructed by the ADS
	holders. If the depositary receives voting instructions in time from a ADS holders which fail to specify the manner in which the depositary is to vote the shares underlying such ADS holders ADSs, such ADS holder will be deemed to have
	instructed the depositary to vote in favor of the items set forth in such voting instructions. If the depositary has not received timely instructions from an ADS holder, such ADS holder shall be deemed to have instructed the depositary to give a
	discretionary proxy to a person designated by us, subject to the conditions set forth in the deposit agreement. If requested by us, the depositary is required to represent all Shares underlying ADSs, regardless whether timely instructions have been
	received from such ADS holders, for the sole purpose of establishing a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. In addition, in your capacity as an ADS holder, you will not be able to examine our accounting books and records, or exercise appraisal
	rights. Registered holders of our shares withdrawn from the depositary arrangements will be entitled to vote and exercise other direct shareholder rights in accordance with Indian law. However, a holder may not know about a meeting sufficiently in
	advance to withdraw the underlying shares in time. Furthermore, an ADS holder may not receive voting materials, if we do not instruct the depositary to distribute such materials, or may not receive such voting materials in time to instruct the
	depositary to vote. See Description of American Depositary Shares in the accompanying base prospectus for more information on the terms and conditions of the deposit agreement.


	Moreover, pursuant to Indian regulations, we are required to offer our shareholders preemptive rights to subscribe for a proportionate number
	of Shares to maintain their existing ownership percentages prior to the issue of new Shares. These rights may be waived by a resolution passed by at least 75% of our shareholders present and voting at a general meeting. ADS holders may be unable to
	exercise preemptive rights for subscribing to these new Shares unless a registration statement under the Securities Act is effective or an exemption from the registration requirements is available to us. Our decision to file a registration statement
	would be based on the costs, timing, potential liabilities and the perceived benefits associated with any such registration statement and we do not commit that we would file such a registration statement. If any issue of securities is made to our
	shareholders in the future, such securities may also be issued to the depositary, which may sell such securities in the Indian securities market for the benefit of the holders of ADSs. There can be no assurance as to the value, if any, the
	depositary would receive upon the sale of such rights or securities. To the extent that ADS holders are unable to exercise preemptive rights, their proportionate interest our company would be reduced.




	The Government of Indias regulation of foreign ownership could materially reduce the price of the ADSs.




	Foreign ownership of Indian securities is regulated and is partially restricted. In addition, there are restrictions on the deposit of shares
	into our ADS facilities. ADSs issued by companies in certain emerging markets, including India, may trade at a discount to the underlying equity shares, in part because of the restrictions on foreign ownership of the underlying equity shares and in
	part because ADSs are sometimes


	 


	S-33







	Table of Contents



	perceived to offer less liquidity than underlying shares that can be traded freely in local markets by both local and international investors. See Restrictions Regarding Foreign Investment
	in India in the accompanying base prospectus for more information regarding restrictions on foreign investment under Indian laws, rules and regulations.




	There are restrictions on daily movements in the price of the Shares, which may constrain a shareholders ability to sell, or the price at which a
	shareholder can sell, Shares at a particular point in time.




	The Shares are subject to a daily circuit breaker imposed by stock
	exchanges in India on publicly-listed companies, including us, which does not allow transactions causing volatility in the price of the Shares above a certain threshold. This circuit breaker operates independently from the index-based market-wide
	circuit breakers generally imposed by SEBI on Indian stock exchanges. The percentage limit on our circuit breaker is set by the Indian stock exchanges based on the historical volatility in the price and trading volume of our Shares. The Indian stock
	exchanges are not required to inform us of the percentage limit of the circuit breaker from time to time, and may change it without our knowledge. This circuit breaker effectively acts to limit the upward and downward movements in the price of our
	Shares. As a result of this circuit breaker, we cannot make any assurance regarding the ability of our shareholders to sell their Shares or the price at which such shareholders may be able to sell their Shares.




	You may be subject to Indian taxes arising out of capital gains on the sale of the Shares.




	Capital gains arising from the sale of shares are generally taxable in India. Any gain realized on the sale of the Shares on an Indian stock
	exchange held for more than 12 months will not be subject to capital gains tax in India if the securities transaction tax has been paid on the transaction. The securities transaction tax will be levied on and collected by the Indian stock exchange
	on which the Shares are sold. Any gain realized on the sale of Shares held for more than 12 months on which no securities transaction tax has been paid, will be subject to capital gains tax in India. Furthermore, any gain realized on the sale of the
	Shares held for a period of 12 months or less will be subject to capital gains tax in India. See TaxationTaxation of Capital Gains and LossesIndian Taxation in the accompanying base prospectus for more information regarding
	the Indian taxation of capital gains arising from the sale of shares.


	It is unclear as to whether capital gains derived from the sale of
	Rights by a non-resident of India, not entitled to exemption under a tax treaty, to another non-resident of India taking place outside India will be subject to Indian capital gains tax. If the Rights are deemed by the Indian tax authorities to be
	situated within India, the gains realized on the sale of Rights will be subject to Indian taxation. The Rights would generally be in the nature of short-term capital assets. For determining such capital gains derived from the sale of Rights, the
	cost of acquisition of the Rights to acquire Shares and ADSs shall be $0.



	Risks Related to the Rights Offering





	The market prices of our ADSs, Rights and Shares may fluctuate significantly.




	The market prices of the ADSs, the Rights and the Shares could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the
	market regarding these securities and/or securities of other automotive manufacturers. The fluctuations could result from national and global economic and financial conditions, the markets response to the Rights Offering, market perceptions of
	us and various other factors and events, including regulatory changes affecting out operations, variations in our operating results, business developments relating to our company or competitors and liquidity of financial markets. Stock markets
	experience, from time to time, significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the ADSs, the Ordinary Shares and the A Ordinary Shares. Furthermore, the operating results and prospects of our company
	may, from time to time, be below the expectations of market analysts and investors. Any of these events could result in a significant decline in the market price of the ADSs, the Rights and the Shares.


	 


	S-34







	Table of Contents





	An active trading market in the Rights may not develop.




	The ADS Rights are expected to be traded on the NYSE while the Ordinary Share Rights and A Ordinary Share Rights are expected to be
	traded on a specialized window of the BSE and the NSE during the Rights trading periods. We do not intend to apply for admission of any of these Rights to trading on any other stock exchange. An active trading market in the ADS Rights may not
	develop on the NYSE and an active trading market in the Ordinary Share Rights or the A Ordinary Share Rights may not develop on the BSE and NSE. The Ordinary Share Rights or A Ordinary Share Rights can be renounced on the
	floor of BSE and NSE. However, the same is subject to RBI approval. See The Rights OfferingSubscription by Holders of Ordinary Share Rights and A Ordinary Share RightsRenunciation. There is no assurance that
	sufficient liquidity will be available in the relevant Rights. In addition, because the trading price of the Rights depends on the trading price of the underlying ADSs, Ordinary Shares, and A Ordinary Shares, the prices of the Rights may
	be volatile and subject to the same risks as noted in this prospectus supplement.




	There is no certainty that the listing and admission to trading
	of the new Ordinary Shares and new A Ordinary Shares, or that the issuance of the new ADSs, will occur when we expect or at all.




	We cannot assure you that the listing and admission to trading of the Ordinary Shares and the A Ordinary Shares will take place
	when anticipated or at all. Until the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares underlying the new ADSs) are admitted to trading on the BSE and NSE, as applicable, you will not be issued any new ADSs for which you have subscribed.




	Shareholders who do not acquire their full entitlement of new ADSs, new Ordinary Shares, and new A Ordinary Shares in the Rights Offering
	will experience dilution in their ownership of the Company.




	If you do not take up the offer of new ADSs, new Ordinary Shares and
	new A Ordinary Shares in the Rights Offering, your proportionate ownership and voting interests in our company will be reduced, and the percentage that your existing Shares and ADSs represent of our total share capital will be reduced
	accordingly. Even if an existing holder of Rights elects to sell its unexercised Rights, or such Rights are sold on its behalf, the consideration it receives for them may not be sufficient to compensate such holder fully for the dilution of its
	percentage ownership of our share capital that may be caused as a result of the Rights Offering. See Dilution for more information.




	Holders in certain jurisdictions may not be eligible to participate in the Rights Offering and will experience dilution of their interest in the
	Company.




	Due to the restrictions under the securities laws of certain countries, shareholders or ADS holders resident in such
	countries may not be able to exercise Rights. For registered holders of ADSs in these excluded jurisdictions, the ADS Rights Agent will sell the ADS Rights on behalf of such holders and will distribute the cash proceeds from the sale of the ADS
	Rights (net of applicable fees, taxes and expenses) to which such holders would otherwise have been entitled. There is no assurance that the ADS Rights Agent will be able to sell the ADS Rights at a price which would reflect the difference between
	the fair market value of the ADSs and their subscription price in the Rights Offering or at all.


	Holders of Ordinary Share Rights and
	A Ordinary Share Rights in these jurisdictions will not be able to exercise their Rights, and their Rights will lapse without receipt of any consideration or compensation.


	Holders that do not take up the offer of new ADSs, new Ordinary Shares and new A Ordinary Shares in the Rights Offering will
	experience a reduction in their proportionate ownership and voting interests in the Company. See Dilution for more information.


	 


	S-35







	Table of Contents





	Any future issues of Shares will further dilute the holdings of current ADS holders of the Company and
	shareholders and could materially and adversely affect the market price of the Companys ADSs, Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares.




	We may decide to offer additional shares in the future either to raise capital or for other purposes. If ADS holders and shareholders were not
	to take up such offer of shares or were not eligible to participate in such offering, their proportionate ownership and voting interests in the Company would be reduced and the percentage that their ADSs or Shares, as applicable, would represent of
	the total share capital of the Company would be reduced accordingly. An additional offering, or significant sales of Shares by major shareholders, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the ADSs and the Shares.




	Holders of ADSs are subject to exchange rate risk in connection with the Rights Offering




	In the event that the U.S. dollar weakens against the Indian rupee, holders of ADSs subscribing for new ADSs will be required to pay more than
	the estimated subscription price of US$35.84 per new ADS.




	The estimated ADS subscription price is US$35.84 per new ADS. As each
	ADS represents five Ordinary Shares, the estimated subscription price per ADS is five times the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Ordinary Share subscription price, using an exchange rate of Rs. 62.7825 = US$1.00 (the opening exchange rate as published
	by Bloomberg L.P. at 7:29 a.m., New York City time, on March 27, 2015


	). A subscriber of new ADSs must deposit US$39.42 per offered ADS subscribed, which represents 110% of the estimated ADS subscription price. This is to increase the
	likelihood that the ADS Rights Agent will have sufficient funds to pay the actual ADS subscription price in light of a possible appreciation of Indian rupees against the U.S. dollar between the date hereof and the end of the ADS Rights exercise
	period and to pay currency conversion fees as well as the ADS Depositary issuance fee of US$0.05 per new ADS issued. On or about April 29, 2015, we expect to determine the actual U.S. dollar ADS subscription price by converting the Ordinary Share
	subscription price for the offered Ordinary Shares underlying the ADSs subscribed for from Indian rupees into U.S. dollars at a market-based rate. If the actual U.S. dollar subscription price (plus the ADS issuance fee and the currency conversion
	fees) is less than the deposit amount, the ADS Rights Agent will refund such excess amount to the subscribing ADS holder without interest. However, if there is a deficiency as a result


	of such conversion, the ADS Rights Agent will not deliver
	the offered ADSs to such subscribing ADS holder until it has received payment of the deficiency. The ADS Rights Agent may sell a portion of your new ADSs to cover the deficiency if not paid within 14 days from notice of deficiency. Furthermore, the
	conversion of Indian rupees back into U.S. dollars if the condition of the Rights Offering is not satisfied (and, as a result, the Indian rupee subscription amount is returned to the ADS Rights Agent) may give rise to losses due to exchange rate
	fluctuation.






	If the Rights Offering does not take place, our credit ratings and funding costs could be materially and adversely affected,
	and the price of our securities could drop sharply. In either case, the Rights could become worthless.




	The Rights Offering is
	underwritten by the underwriters based on an underwriting agreement from which the underwriters may withdraw under certain circumstances. See The Rights OfferingSubscription by Holders of Ordinary Share Rights and A Ordinary
	Share RightsWithdrawal of the Offering and Plan of Distribution. If the underwriting agreement is terminated, the Rights Offering may be cancelled and we would not receive the net proceeds expected to be generated by the
	Rights Offering.


	In addition, if the Rights Offering is cancelled, the Rights will expire without compensation and become worthless. Any
	subscription payments received by us will be returned without interest. Investors who have acquired any Rights on the secondary market will then bear a corresponding loss, because trading in Rights cannot be reversed if the Rights Offering is
	terminated.


	Moreover, the value of the Rights materially depends on the price of the Companys existing Ordinary Shares,
	A Ordinary Shares and ADSs. A considerable drop in the price of these securities can therefore materially and adversely affect the value of the Rights and render them worthless. In such an event, investors who have acquired any Rights in
	the secondary market will bear a corresponding loss.


	 


	S-36







	Table of Contents





	The price of our ADSs and Shares may fluctuate or decline before or after the expiration of the ADS Rights
	and may fall below the ADS subscription price of the New ADSs issued upon the exercise of the ADS Rights.




	Given that the trading
	price of the ADS Rights depends on the price of our ADSs and our Shares, a significant decline in the trading price of our ADSs or our Shares would negatively affect the trading price of the ADS Rights. The market price of our ADSs and our Shares
	could be subject to significant fluctuations. We cannot assure holders of ADS Rights that the trading price of our ADSs will not decline below the actual ADS subscription price after such holders elect to exercise their ADS Rights. If that occurs,
	such holders will have committed to purchase the new ADSs at a price above the prevailing trading price, and such holders will suffer an immediate unrealized loss as a result. Moreover, we cannot assure holders of ADS Rights that following the
	exercise of ADS Rights they will be able to sell their ADSs at a price equal to or greater than the actual ADS subscription price.




	A delay in the
	listing of the new Shares would affect the liquidity of such new Shares and the issuance of new ADSs representing such new Shares.




	We will request that the new Shares be admitted to trading on the BSE and the NSE promptly after their allotment, which is expected to take
	place on or about May 14, 2015. We expect, but cannot assure you, that the new Shares will be admitted to listing on the BSE and the NSE on or about May 18, 2015.


	A delay in the admission to listing of the new Shares would affect the liquidity of the new Shares and prevent the sale of such Shares on the
	BSE or the NSE until they are allowed for listing. In addition, any delay in the admission to listing of the new Shares will delay the issuance of the new ADSs representing such Shares. Given these possible delays, we cannot provide any assurance
	that the new ADSs will be issued promptly after the allotment of the new Shares. Any delay in the allotment of the new Shares and their admission to listing in the BSE or the NSE, or in the issuance of the new ADSs, will affect the ability of the
	exercising holders of Rights to sell the new Shares or ADSs to be received upon the exercise of Rights.

	USE OF PROCEEDS



	Assuming all of the new Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares sold in the Rights Offering are subscribed for at the subscription
	price of Rs.450 per new Ordinary Share and Rs.271 per A Ordinary Share, the net proceeds of the Rights Offering are expected to be approximately Rs.74,280 million (approximately US$1,183.1 million) after deduction of fees and
	expenses of approximately Rs.700 million (approximately US$11.1 million).


	The objects set out in the Memorandum of Association enable us
	to undertake our existing activities and the activities for which the funds are being raised through the Rights Offering.

	We propose to deploy the net proceeds in the manner described above in Fiscal 2016.


	If the net proceeds are not completely utilized for the objects stated above by the end of Fiscal 2016 due to factors such as
	(i) economic and business conditions; (ii) increased competition; (iii) commercial considerations; (iv) change in business strategy; and (v) regulatory changes; such proceeds would be utilized (in part or full) in Fiscal 2017 or
	a subsequent period as may be determined by us in accordance with applicable law.


	The funds deployment, other than for repayment of
	certain of our borrowings, described herein is based on management estimates, current circumstances of our business and the prevailing market conditions. The funds deployment described herein has not been appraised by any bank or financial
	institution. We have not placed orders or obtained quotations in respect of a substantial portion of the fund requirements described in this section. We may have to revise our funding requirements and deployment on account of a variety of factors
	such as our financial condition, business and strategy, including external factors which may not be within the control of our management. This may entail rescheduling and revising the planned funding requirements and deployment and increasing or
	decreasing the funding requirements from the planned funding requirements at the discretion of our management.


	We propose to meet the
	entire requirement of funds for the objects of the Rights Offering from the net proceeds of the Rights Offering.



	Funding capital expenditure towards
	plant and machinery



	We undertake investments towards capital expenditure on a continual basis to meet our business requirements and
	towards new product introduction, sustenance, increasing efficiency, modernization and removing production constraints. In addition to domestic suppliers and vendors, we also import capital equipment, raw materials and components from suppliers and
	vendors in various countries.

	Our capital expenditure typically includes expenses for purchase of plant and machinery, tools
	and other equipments, installation and commissioning expenses, expenses for purchase of vehicles, civil construction, fit-out and consultancy related expenses for our workshops and offices and expenses for purchase of computers.



	Funding expenditure relating to research and product development



	We intend to continue to invest in our business units in general, and in research and product development in particular, over the next several
	years in order to improve our existing product range, develop new products and platforms and to build and expand our portfolio in the passenger vehicle and commercial vehicle categories. We believe this would strengthen our position in the Indian
	automotive market and help us to grow our market share internationally.


	Expenses towards research and product development consists of
	material costs which include cost of material used for (i) prototype vehicles; (ii) pilot batch and product proving vehicles; and (iii) benchmarking vehicles. Prototype vehicles are used for performing all tests such as durability, fuel economy,
	reliability, endurance and crash tests that are required to assess performance of the vehicle. Pilot batch includes a small lot of vehicles rolled out for identifying manufacturing issues, if any, which uses soft tools. Pilot batch is followed by
	product proving vehicles which is a larger lot of vehicles for verifying other parameters related to production process including tact time, cycle time, quality and consistency.


	R&D expenses also consist of technical know-how expenses which include costs incurred towards various external agencies who provide
	technical inputs and research and development support in specialized fields. In addition to technical support, certain agencies provide finished components to us as part of their mandate once the regular production commences. Technical know-how
	expenses also include costs associated with such finished components provided by the external agencies in addition to the technical support.


	In addition to the above, R&D expenses also consist of conversion costs which include expenses incurred towards the design engineers in
	the Engineering Research Center.


	The table below sets forth estimated expenses based on category of vehicle.

	Repayment, in full or part, of certain long-term and short-term borrowings availed by us



	We estimate that Rs.40 billion (approximately US$637.1 million) from the net proceeds of the Rights Offering will be used towards repayment, in
	full or in part, of certain loans. The selection and extent of loans


	 


	S-39







	Table of Contents



	proposed to be repaid, while based on the applicable repayment schedule in Fiscal 2016, is also and will be based on various commercial considerations including, among others, interest rates,
	outstanding amounts and the remaining tenor of the loan and applicable law governing such borrowings.


	Among the borrowings that we expect
	to repay are Rs.15 billion (approximately US$238.9 million) due to the State Bank of India under a working capital facility and commercial papers issued in 2012, and an aggregate of Rs.11 billion (approximately US$175.2 million), representing the
	amount outstanding under commercial papers issued by and short term loan arrangements with HDFC Bank Limited and HDFC Trustee Company Private Limited.


	Given the nature of these borrowings and the terms of repayment, the aggregate outstanding loan amounts may vary from time to time. In
	addition to the above, we may, from time to time, enter into further financing arrangements and draw down funds thereunder. In such cases or in case any loans are repaid or further drawn-down prior to the completion of the Rights Offering, we may
	utilize this component of the net proceeds towards repayment of such additional indebtedness. The net proceeds may also be utilized for repayment of any such further borrowings and refinancing, subject to the maximum utilization of Rs.40 billion.


	We believe that such repayment will help reduce our outstanding indebtedness, debt servicing costs and debt-equity ratio, thereby
	resulting in an enhanced equity base, assisting us in maintaining a favorable debt-equity ratio in the near future and enable utilization of our accruals for further investment in our business growth and expansion. In addition, we believe that this
	would improve our ability to raise further resources in the future to fund our potential business development opportunities.




	General Corporate
	Purposes




	We propose to deploy the remaining net proceeds aggregating Rs.1,428 million towards general corporate purposes, subject
	to such utilization not exceeding 25% of the net proceeds, in compliance with SEBI regulations, including but not limited to strategic initiatives, partnerships and joint ventures, meeting exigencies which we may face in the ordinary course of
	business, meeting expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business and any other purpose as may be approved by our board of directors or a duly appointed committee from time to time, subject to compliance with the necessary provisions of the
	Companies Act.


	Our management, in accordance with the policies of our board of directors, will have flexibility in utilizing any amounts
	for general corporate purposes under the overall guidance and policies of our board of directors. The amount of utilization of funds for any of the purposes will be determined by the board of directors, based on the amount actually available and our
	business requirements.

	PRICE RANGE OF ORDINARY SHARES, A ORDINARY SHARES AND
	ADSS



	Our Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares currently trade on the NSE and the BSE, and ADSs representing our Ordinary
	Shares currently trade on the NYSE. During 2014, volume traded on the BSE totaled 113,199,502 Ordinary Shares and 41,737,663 A Ordinary Shares, volume traded on the NSE totaled 1,319,522,856 Ordinary Shares and 578,698,577 A
	Ordinary Shares and the volume traded on the NYSE totaled 322,073,324 ADSs.


	Our Ordinary Shares have been trading on the NYSE in the
	United States since September 27, 2004 in the form of ADSs under the symbol TTM. Each ADS represents five Ordinary Shares. The ADSs are outstanding under the amended and restated deposit agreement dated as of September 27, 2004
	among us, Citibank, N.A. as ADS Depositary, and all holders and beneficial owners of ADSs issued thereunder, as amended and supplemented by Amendment No. 1, dated as of December 16, 2009 (the deposit agreement). Only persons in
	whose names ADSs are registered on the books of the depositary are deemed by the depositary to be holders of ADSs.


	As of March 27,
	2015, 116,447,836 ADSs (equivalent to 582,239,180 Ordinary Shares) were outstanding, representing approximately 21.28% of the total number of outstanding Ordinary Shares. It is not practicable for us to determine the number of ADSs beneficially
	owned by beneficial owners in the United States. The ADS closing price on March 27, 2015 on the NYSE was US$44.00 per ADS.



	Shares and ADS Trading



	The table below shows, for the periods indicated, high and low intraday prices for our Ordinary Shares on the BSE and the NSE and for
	our ADSs on the NYSE.


	The face value of Shares was subdivided effective September 14, 2011. Post-subdivision, Ordinary Shares have
	each been subdivided from having par value of Rs.10 each into five shares having par value of Rs.2 each.


	The prices for Ordinary Shares
	and A Ordinary Shares as given below in Fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 are before the subdivision of Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares, thus are not comparable to subsequent years.

	The following table sets forth information concerning our cash, short-term debt, long-term debt, non-controlling interest and
	shareholders equity under IFRS as of December 31, 2014 and as adjusted to give effect to (i) the Rights Offering, (ii) the GBP 400,000,000 3.875% Senior Notes issuance and the US$500,000,000 3.5% Senior Notes issuance by Jaguar Land
	Rover, referred to as the JLR Bond Offering, (iii) the Dollar Tender Offer and the Sterling Tender Offer, referred to as the JLR Tender Offers, and (iv) the repurchase of an aggregate amount of Rs.12.5 billion of non-convertible debentures
	expected to take place on or about the date of this prospectus supplement, the NCD Repurchase.


	The information in the following table is
	derived from our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the nine months ended December 31, 2014 prepared in accordance with IFRS and incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement. This table should be read
	together with such unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. The adjusted figures in the table below have been prepared for illustrative purposes only on the basis that new Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares
	representing ADSs) and new A Ordinary Shares offered in the Rights Offering will be sold at the subscription price of Rs.450 per Ordinary Share and Rs.271 per A Ordinary Share, and do not necessarily provide an actual picture
	of our financial position following the completion of the Rights Offering.

	THE RIGHTS OFFERING




	General Information



	Pursuant to a
	shareholders resolution by way of postal ballot on March 3, 2015, authority was granted to our board of directors to decide upon and determine the terms of the Rights Offering. On March 25, 2015, our board of directors adopted a
	resolution to approve the terms and conditions of the Rights Offering.



	Description of the Share Rights Offering



	Holders of our Ordinary Shares will receive 0.055045 Ordinary Shares for every Ordinary Share that they hold as of April 8, 2015, the
	Book Closure Date, on the BSE (in respect of Ordinary Shares traded on the BSE) and the NSE (in respect of Ordinary Shares traded on the NSE) at the share subscription price. Each Ordinary Share Right entitles the holder thereof to subscribe for one
	new Ordinary Share at the share subscription price.


	Holders of our A Ordinary Shares will receive 0.055045 A
	Ordinary Share Rights for every A Ordinary Share that they own as of April 8, 2015, the Book Closure Date, on the BSE (in respect of A Ordinary Shares traded on the BSE) and the NSE (in respect of Ordinary Shares traded
	on the NSE). Each A Ordinary Share Right entitles the holder thereof to subscribe for one new A Ordinary Share at the share subscription price.


	We have received approvals for listing of the Shares to be issued pursuant to the Rights Offering from the BSE and the NSE.



	Description of the ADS Rights Offering



	We have arranged with Citibank, N.A., as ADS Rights Agent and as the ADS Depositary and accordingly the holder of record of the Ordinary Shares
	underlying the ADSs, to make available to holders of our ADSs at the ADS record date transferable ADS Rights.


	Each registered holder of
	ADSs as of the ADS record date of April 7, 2015 and with a registered address in an Eligible Jurisdiction will be sent an ADS Rights certificate evidencing ADS Rights and instructions relating to the exercise of these ADS Rights. Each eligible
	beneficial owner of ADSs (located or resident in an Eligible Jurisdiction) will receive a book-entry credit of ADS Rights in its DTC participant account and instructions relating to the exercise of the ADS Rights.


	Fractions of Ordinary Share Rights, A Ordinary Share Rights and ADS Rights will not be issued to holders. Fractional entitlements
	to Ordinary Share Rights, A Ordinary Share Rights and be rounded down to the nearest whole number and any remaining fractional Ordinary Share Rights, A Ordinary Share Rights and ADS Rights will lapse without compensation. All
	offered Shares not taken up will be available for allocation to holders of Shares who wish to apply for a greater number of offered Shares or offered ADSs, as the case may be, than those initially offered to them under the Rights Offering, subject
	to certain limitations as described below.



	Proceeds to the Company



	Assuming full subscription of the Rights Offering, we will receive proceeds of Rs.74,280 million (approximately US$1,183.1 million) after
	deduction of fees and expenses incurred in connection with the offering. Assuming that the Rights Offering is fully subscribed, we will issue 150,644,759 new Ordinary Shares, including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs, and 26,530,290 new
	A Ordinary Shares and expect to have 2,887,357,881 Ordinary Shares and 508,497,235 A Ordinary Shares outstanding after the Rights Offering.

	Table of Contents



	Further information about the ADS Rights and the procedures for exercising the ADS Rights are
	summarized below.



	Restrictions on Participation in the Rights Offering by certain ADS Holders and Shareholders



	The Rights Offering is only addressed to persons to whom it may lawfully be made. The distribution of this prospectus supplement, the
	accompanying base prospectus, the Interim Report, the Annual Report incorporated by reference and the exercise of any of the Rights may be restricted under applicable law. Persons into whose possession this prospectus supplement, the prospectus, the
	Interim Report or the Annual Report incorporated by reference comes or who wish to exercise any of the Rights must inform themselves about and observe any such restrictions. Any failure to comply with any of those restrictions may constitute a
	violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. Due to the restrictions under the securities laws of certain countries, shareholders or ADS holders resident in such countries may not exercise the Rights. For registered holders of ADSs in
	these jurisdictions, the depositary will use commercially reasonable efforts to sell the ADS Rights on behalf of such holders and will distribute the cash proceeds from the sale of the ADS Rights (net of applicable fees, taxes and expenses) to which
	such holders would otherwise have been entitled. Brokers, banks and other nominees, who hold ADSs for clients that are the beneficial owners of the ADSs and are located or reside outside of the Eligible Jurisdictions, are instructed not to
	distribute the ADS Rights they may receive on behalf of such clients and, in lieu of such distribution of ADS Rights, the brokers, banks and other nominees are requested to sell the ADS Rights on behalf of such clients (either directly or through
	the ADS Rights Agent) and to distribute to such clients only the net cash proceeds from such sales. Brokers, banks and other nominees exercising ADS Rights on behalf of their clients will be asked to certify that such clients are Eligible ADS Rights
	Holders. Holders of Ordinary Share Rights and A Ordinary Share Rights in these jurisdictions may not be able to exercise their Rights, and their Rights will lapse without receipt of consideration.

	Excess Applications




	All ADSs not taken up in terms of the ADS Rights Offering will be available for allocation to holders of ADS Rights who validly exercise all of
	their ADS Rights and validly apply for a greater number of ADSs than the ADSs they can subscribe for upon exercise of their ADS Rights. The number of excess ADSs available for allocation to holders of ADS Rights is subject to a maximum calculated as
	follows:




	A


	


	B


	=


	C


	,






	where:




	A


	is
	equal to the maximum number of ADSs that may be subscribed by all ADS Rights holders (without giving effect to Excess Applications);




	B


	is equal to the number of ADSs subscribed by ADS Rights holders (without giving effect to Excess Applications); and




	C


	is equal to the maximum amount of ADSs available for allocation to holders who wish to apply for a greater number of ADSs than
	initially offered to them.


	Excess ADSs will be allocated, based on the number of ADS Rights validly exercised, to holders of ADS Rights
	who have exercised their ADS Rights in full and have validly applied for excess ADSs.


	In order to apply for excess ADSs, an ADS Rights
	holder must first exercise in full the ADS Rights it holds and apply for excess ADSs. To validly apply for excess ADSs, the ADS Rights holder must deposit the ADS deposit amount (as described under ADS Subscription Price) for the excess
	ADSs being applied for. The available excess ADSs will be allocated, based on the number of ADS Rights validly exercised, to holders of ADS Rights that have exercised their ADS Rights in full and have validly applied for excess ADSs. If the number
	of excess ADSs available is insufficient to satisfy the excess ADS subscription by any ADS Right holder in full, the deposit of the ADS deposit amount (as described under ADS Subscription Price) relating to any excess ADSs not delivered
	to such ADS Right holder shall be returned to such ADS Right holder in U.S. dollars without interest. No fractional ADSs will be issued pursuant to Excess Applications.


	Excess applications must be made together with initial subscriptions for ADSs, are irrevocable and may not be cancelled or modified after
	exercise.




	ADS Rights Offering Subscription Period




	The ADS Rights may be exercised during the period from 9:00 a.m., New York City time, on April 10, 2015 to 2:15 p.m., New York City time, on
	April 27, 2015, referred to hereinafter as the ADS Rights Offering subscription period. The ADS Rights Offering subscription period ends before the share subscription period. ADS Rights that are not exercised by the end of the ADS Rights Offering
	subscription period will expire valueless without any compensation.


	Any exercise of ADS Rights (including any application for excess
	ADSs) will be irrevocable upon exercise and may not be canceled or modified after such exercise.




	ADS Rights Agent




	Citibank, N.A., which is the ADS Depositary under the deposit agreement, is acting as the ADS Rights Agent.

	ADS Subscription Price




	The estimated ADS subscription price is US$35.84 per ADS subscribed. The actual ADS subscription price per ADS will be the share subscription
	price of Rs.2,250 (adjusted to reflect the ADS-to- share ratio) translated into U.S. dollars on or about April 29, 2015 plus currency conversion fees and the ADS Depositarys issuance fee of US$0.05 per new ADS issued. The estimated ADS
	subscription price is the U.S. dollar equivalent of the share subscription price for five Ordinary Shares, using an exchange rate of Rs.62.7825 per U.S. dollar (the opening exchange rate published by Bloomberg L.P. at 7:29 a.m., New York City
	time, on March 27, 2015).

	A subscriber of the ADSs must deposit US$39.42 per ADS subscribed, or the ADS deposit amount, which represents 110% of the estimated ADS subscription price, upon the exercise of each ADS Right.

	This
	additional amount over and above the estimated ADS subscription price is to increase the likelihood that the ADS Rights Agent will have sufficient funds to pay the ADS subscription price in light of a possible appreciation of the Indian rupee
	against the U.S. dollar between the date hereof and the end of the ADS Rights Offering subscription period and to pay currency conversion fees as well as the ADS Depositarys issuance fee of $0.05 per new ADS issued.


	The ADS Rights Agent expects to make the conversion from U.S. dollars into Indian rupees on or about April 29, 2015 to pay the share
	subscription price for the offered Shares underlying the offered ADSs. If the actual U.S. dollar price (equal to the share subscription price stated in U.S. dollars on or about April 29, 2015) plus the new ADS issuance fee and the currency
	conversion fees is less than the ADS deposit amount, the ADS Rights Agent will refund such excess to the subscribing ADS Rights holder without interest. However, if the U.S. dollar cost of the share subscription price plus the ADS issuance fee and
	the currency conversion fees exceeds the ADS deposit amount, the ADS Rights Agent will not deliver the offered ADSs to such subscribing ADS Rights holder until it has received payment of the deficiency. The ADS Rights Agent may sell a portion of the
	new ADSs that is sufficient to pay any shortfall that is not paid within 14 days of notice of the deficiency. In addition, to the extent that the shortfall of the ADS deposit amount below the U.S. dollar cost of the share subscription price plus the
	new ADS issuance fee and the currency conversion fees exceeds 20 percent, the ADS Rights Agent may reduce pro rata the amount of new Shares for which it subscribes, which will reduce the number of new ADSs that will be available for delivery to
	subscribing ADS Rights holders.




	ADS Subscription Procedures




	Subscriptions (including applications for excess ADSs) and full payment must be received by the ADS Rights Agent prior to 2:15 p.m., New York
	City time, on April 27, 2015.


	We and the ADS Rights Agent will determine all questions about the timeliness, validity, form and
	eligibility of any exercise of the right to subscribe for offered ADSs. In our sole discretion, we may waive any defect or irregularity, permit you to correct a defect or defects, or irregularity within the time we determine or reject the purported
	exercise of ADS Rights. ADS Rights certificates will not be considered received or accepted until we have waived all defects or irregularities or you have cured them in time. Neither we nor the ADS Rights Agent has to notify you of any defect or
	irregularity in submitting an ADS Rights certificate. We and the ADS Rights Agent will not incur any liability for failing to do so.


	You
	may exercise your ADS Rights to subscribe for offered ADSs as follows:




	Subscription by brokers and banks.




	Each eligible beneficial owner of ADSs held within DTC will receive a book-entry credit of ADS Rights in its DTC participant account and
	instructions relating to the exercise of the ADS Rights.


	If you hold ADS Rights through DTC, you can exercise your ADS Rights (including
	application for excess ADSs) by delivering completed subscription instructions for offered ADSs through DTCs applicable function and instructing DTC to charge your applicable DTC account for the ADS deposit amount for the ADSs and to


	 


	S-50







	Table of Contents



	deliver such amount to the ADS Rights Agent. DTC must receive the subscription instructions and the payment of the ADS deposit amount for the ADSs so as to allow DTC sufficient time to transmit
	the subscription instructions and payment of the ADS deposit amount to the ADS Rights Agent prior to the expiration of the ADS Rights Offering subscription period. If the ADS subscription instructions and deposit amount with respect to ADS Rights
	are not received by the ADS Rights Agent by the end of the ADS Rights Offering subscription period, the ADS Rights Agent will not be authorized to and consequently will not, accept any delivery or exercise of subscription instructions with respect
	to those ADS Rights. Brokers, banks and other nominees exercising ADS Rights on behalf of their clients will be asked to certify (through DTCs applicable function) that such clients are Eligible ADS Rights Holders.




	Subscription by registered holders.




	Each eligible registered holder of Existing ADSs will be sent by regular mail a subscription form showing its ADS Rights entitlement and
	instructions relating to the exercise of these ADS Rights (including application for excess ADSs).


	If you are a holder of ADS Rights
	registered directly with the ADS Depositary, you may exercise your ADS Rights by delivering to the ADS Rights Agent a properly completed ADS Rights certificate and paying in full the ADS deposit amount for the offered ADSs. Payment must be made by
	certified check or bank draft made payable to Citibank, N.A.Tata Motors ADS Rights Offering.


	The properly completed ADS
	Rights certificate and payment should be delivered to:


	 
















	By First Class Mail:








	By Hand or Overnight Courier:













	Citibank, N.A.


	c/o Voluntary Corporate
	Actions

	Canton, MA

	The ADS Rights Agent must receive the ADS Rights certificate and payment of the ADS deposit amount on or
	before the end of the ADS Rights Offering subscription period. Deposit in the mail will not constitute delivery to the ADS Rights Agent. The ADS Rights Agent has discretion to refuse to accept any improperly completed or improperly executed ADS
	Rights certificate.


	You will elect the method of delivering the ADS Rights certificate and paying the ADS deposit amount to the ADS
	Rights Agent and you will bear any risk associated with it. If you send the ADS Rights certificate and payment by mail, you should use registered mail, properly insured, with return receipt requested, and allow sufficient time to ensure delivery to
	the ADS Rights Agent.




	Subscription by beneficial owners.




	If you are a beneficial owner of ADS Rights and wish to subscribe for offered ADSs but are neither a DTC participant nor a registered holder of
	ADS Rights, you should timely contact the financial intermediary through which you hold ADS Rights to arrange for their exercise (including application for excess ADSs) and to arrange for payment of the ADS deposit amount. You are urged to consult
	your financial intermediary without delay in case your financial intermediary is unable to act immediately.




	Guaranteed Delivery Procedures




	If you wish to subscribe for offered ADSs (including application for excess ADSs) but time will not permit your ADS Rights to
	reach the ADS Rights Agent before the time the ADS Rights expire, you may still subscribe if, at or before the ADS Rights expiration date, the ADS Rights Agent has received a properly completed and


	 


	S-51







	Table of Contents



	signed notice of guaranteed delivery, substantially in the form provided with the instructions distributed with the ADS Rights certificates, from a financial institution that is a member of the
	Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP), the Stock Exchange Medallion Program (SEMP) or the New York Stock Exchange Inc. Medallion Signature Program (MSP). These institutions are commonly referred to as eligible
	institutions. Most banks, savings and loan associations and brokerage houses are participants in these programs and therefore are eligible institutions. The ADS Rights Agent must also receive payment in full of the ADS deposit amount on or
	before the ADS Rights expiration date. The notice of guaranteed delivery must state your name and the number of new ADSs you are subscribing for and must irrevocably guarantee that the ADS Rights will be delivered by one of those financial
	institutions to the ADS Rights Agent before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third NYSE trading day following the date of execution of the notice of guaranteed delivery.


	The notice of guaranteed delivery may be delivered by first class mail, by hand or by overnight courier to the ADS Rights Agent together with
	a certified check covering the full ADS deposit amount. If you hold your ADS Rights through DTC, your DTC participant must deliver the notice of guaranteed delivery to the ADS Rights Agent through DTCs confirmation system. If the financial
	institution fails to deliver ADS Rights before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third NYSE trading day following the date of execution of the notice of guaranteed delivery, the ADS Rights Agent will refund to you the total deposit amount you
	paid to the ADS Rights Agent, without interest, after deducting any loss and expenses it incurred from the failed guaranteed delivery.




	Partial
	Exercise of ADS Rights




	Subject to the requirements for the exercise of ADS Rights contained herein,


	 




	 


	


	 


	in the event that you are a registered holder of ADS Rights and you wish to exercise only a portion of your total ADS Rights, you will need to deliver the applicable ADS Rights certificate to the ADS Rights Agent along
	with the completed subscription instructions, and the ADS Rights Agent will employ commercially reasonable efforts to re-issue to you an ADS Rights certificate evidencing the remaining balance of ADS Rights not exercised held by you following the
	exercise; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	in the event that you are a beneficial owner of ADS Rights and you wish to exercise only a portion of your total ADS Rights, you will need to instruct the financial intermediary through which you hold your ADS Rights to
	debit the ADS Rights from the applicable book-entry account and deliver the ADS Rights to the ADS Rights Agent and further instruct the ADS Rights Agent to subscribe only for the applicable number of ADS Rights.






	Fractional Entitlements to ADSs and ADS Rights




	Upon receipt of Ordinary Share Rights as a holder of Ordinary Shares, the ADS Depositary will allocate such Ordinary Share Rights in the form
	of ADS Rights to registered holders of ADSs as well as financial intermediaries that hold ADSs on behalf of beneficial owners on a proportionate basis. Fractions of ADS Rights will not be issued and as such any entitlement to receive a fraction of
	an ADS Right will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and will lapse without compensation.


	To the extent additional ADSs are to
	be delivered pursuant to Excess Applications, the additional ADSs shall be proportionately allocated (on the basis of the numbers of ADS Rights validly exercised) to registered holders and financial intermediaries holding ADS Rights on behalf of
	beneficial owners that make applications for excess ADSs. Any fractional entitlements to excess ADSs shall be disregarded.




	Delivery of Offered ADSs




	The ADSs issued pursuant to the exercise of ADS Rights will rank equally in all respects with existing ADSs. The ADS Depositary
	will deliver the new ADSs as soon as practicable after the delivery of the underlying


	 


	S-52







	Table of Contents



	offered Ordinary Shares to the ADS Depositarys custodian by credit to its book-entry account with a financial intermediary registered in the Republic of India and admission of the offered
	Ordinary Shares to listing and trading on the BSE and the NSE.




	Selling ADS Rights




	Subject to compliance with relevant securities laws, the ADS Rights are freely transferable. The ADS Rights are expected to trade on the NYSE
	under the symbol TTM RT from 9:30 a.m., New York City time, on April 10, 2015 until April 24, 2015. The NYSE has indicated that initially the ADS Rights may trade on a when-issued basis.


	If you are a registered holder of ADS Rights and you wish to sell your ADS Rights, you may do so through a broker, or, alternatively, you may
	instruct the ADS Rights Agent to do so on your behalf by following the instructions on, and accompanying, the ADS Rights entitlement certificate sent to you. The ADS Rights Agent has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for such
	sale on behalf of ADS Rights holders in the open market through a broker.


	If you are a beneficial owner of ADS Rights and wish to sell
	your ADS Rights, you should timely contact the financial intermediary through which you hold the ADS Rights to arrange for the sale. The ADS Rights Agent has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for such sale on behalf of a
	beneficial owner of ADS Rights in the open market through a broker at the instruction of the beneficial owners financial intermediary through DTC.


	Brokers, banks and other nominees, who hold ADSs for clients that (x) are the beneficial owners of the ADSs and are located or reside
	outside of the Eligible Jurisdiction (and may not receive the ADS Rights pursuant to the terms of the ADS Rights Offering) or (y) wish to sell ADS Rights, may instruct the ADS Rights Agent through DTCs applicable function to sell the ADS
	Rights on their behalf. The ADS Rights Agent has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to arrange for such sale on behalf of the brokers, banks and nominees who so instruct it to sell ADS Rights in the open market through a broker.


	The ADS Rights Agent will accept instructions to sell ADS Rights until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 23, 2015. There can
	be no assurance that the ADS Rights Agent will be able to effectuate the sale of the ADS Rights or at what price. The net sale proceeds from the sale of ADS Rights through the ADS Rights Agent will be calculated on the basis of the net weighted
	average of all sales of ADS Rights effectuated by the ADS Rights Agent during the ADS Rights Offering subscription period, will be net of applicable fees, taxes and expenses incurred in connection with the sale of ADS Right, and will be remitted
	after the completion of the ADS Rights offer.

	The sale of ADS Rights through the ADS Rights Agent is subject to execution fees of up to US$0.02 per ADS Right sold.





	Unexercised ADS Rights




	Pursuant
	to the underwriting agreement, the underwriters have agreed to take up a portion of new Ordinary Shares not subscribed for under the Rights Offering, subject to the conditions described under Plan of Distribution. The terms of the
	arrangements among the underwriters are contained in the underwriting agreement, details of which are set forth in Plan of Distribution.


	Any unexercised ADS Rights will lapse without receipt of consideration.




	Subscription by Depositary




	Promptly after the ADS Rights Offering subscription period, the ADS Rights Agent will determine the number of ADS Rights validly exercised
	(including the valid Excess Applications), and will instruct Citibank, N.A.Mumbai (in its capacity as custodian of the shares represented by the ADSs), or the custodian, to exercise


	 


	S-53







	Table of Contents



	the corresponding number of Share Rights in India. The number of new ADSs subscribed on behalf of ADS Rights holders will not exceed the number of new ADSs that may be purchased upon the exercise
	of the Share Rights allocated to the custodian on the basis of the number of shares held in respect of the outstanding ADSs as of the ADS record date, April 7, 2015. Any new ADSs subscribed in excess of such maximum number of new ADSs (as a
	result of Excess Applications) will be rounded down and pro-rated among the ADS Rights holders who validly submitted Excess Applications on the basis of the number of ADS Rights validly exercised.


	When instructing the custodian to exercise the applicable number of Share Rights, the ADS Rights Agent will credit the corresponding ADS
	deposit amount in U.S. dollars to the custodian with instructions to exchange such funds into the applicable amount of Indian rupees necessary to exercise the applicable Share Rights. To the extent the ADS deposit amount exceeds the funds in Indian
	rupees necessary to exercise the applicable Share Rights, the custodian will be instructed to refund the excess amount to the ADS Rights Agent. If the ADS deposit amount is insufficient to fund the exercise of the applicable Share Rights in Indian
	rupees, the ADS Rights Agent will advance additional funds in U.S. dollars to the custodian in an amount sufficient to fund the exercise of the applicable Share Rights in Indian rupees. It is expected that the exchange of U.S. dollars into Indian
	rupees to fund the exercise of Share Rights on behalf of exercising ADS Rights holders will take place during the period of April 29-30, 2015. Any excess or shortage of the ADS deposit amount will be treated by the ADS Rights Agent upon the
	terms described in ADS Subscription Price. The fluctuations of the U.S. dollar to Indian rupee exchange rates will affect the actual ADS subscription price for ADS Rights, which will not be known until after the applicable exchange(s) of
	U.S. dollars to Indian rupees have been completed.

	Ordinary Share and A Ordinary Share Rights




	Each holder of our Ordinary Shares will receive 6 new Ordinary Shares for every 109 fully paid up Ordinary Share that they hold on the share
	record date. Each holder of our A Ordinary Shares will receive 6 Ordinary Shares for every 109 A Ordinary Shares that they hold on the share record date.




	Fractional Entitlements




	Subscriptions will be accepted for a whole number of Shares only and any fractional entitlement will be disregarded, although holders of Share
	Rights may exercise their Right to subscribe for Shares in whole or in part.


	If the holding of any eligible holders of Ordinary Shares or
	A Ordinary Shares, including the ADS Depositary, is, in each case, less than 109 Shares, or not a multiple of 109 Shares, the fractional entitlement of such holders shall be disregarded in the computation of their original Rights
	allotment. Nevertheless, such holders shall be given preferentially consideration for the allotment one additional Share in respect of which they have made excess applications.




	Eligibility of Certain Rights Holders





	Qualified foreign investors:

	The existing individual and aggregate investment limits for eligible qualified foreign investors, in an
	Indian company are 5% and 10% of the paid up capital of the company, respectively.



	Foreign portfolio investors:

	The existing
	individual and aggregate investment limits for a single foreign portfolio investor, or FPI, or an investor group (which means the same set of ultimate beneficial owners investing through multiple entities), in an Indian company are 10% and 24% of
	the paid up capital of the company, respectively. A foreign institutional investor, or FII, holding a valid certificate of registration from SEBI shall be deemed an FPI for the three-year period for which such FII has paid registration fees and such
	FIIs holdings shall be counted towards the applicable investment limits for FPIs.



	Foreign institutional investors:

	The
	existing aggregate investment limit for eligible FIIs, in our Company, is 35% of the fully paid up Ordinary Share capital and 75% of the fully paid up A Ordinary Share capital.



	Non-resident Indian investors:

	Applications received from non-resident Indians or persons of Indian origin residing outside of India,
	including in the United States, shall be subject to conditions imposed by the RBI under FEMA in respect of refunds of application money, allotment of securities, export of share certificates among other matters.




	Notification of Share Rights




	The Registrar will dispatch composite application forms in respect of Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares to each eligible Share
	Rights holder indicating the number of Ordinary Share Rights and A Ordinary Share Rights to which such holder is entitled, at their registered address in India.




	Renunciation




	Holders of Ordinary Share Rights and A Ordinary Share Rights may renounce their Rights in whole or in part in favor of up to three
	other persons (including joint holders) other than:


	(a) partnership firm(s) or their nominees(s);


	(b) minors;


	 


	S-55







	Table of Contents



	(c) Hindu undivided families, as defined under applicable Indian law;


	(d) any trust or society (unless registered under the Indian Societies Registration Act, 1860, as amended or the Indian Trust Act, 1882, as
	amended or any other applicable law relating to societies or trusts and is authorized under its constitutional documents to hold Ordinary Shares or A Ordinary Shares, as the case may be);


	(e) overseas corporate bodies, or OCBs, being any company, partnership, firm, trust, society or other corporate body with respect to which at
	least 60% of the beneficial ownership is held, directly or indirectly, by non-resident Indians, unless they have received prior approval from the RBI; and


	(f) any other person that is otherwise prohibited from being offered or subscribing to securities under applicable securities or other laws.


	We have, pursuant to an application dated February 26, 2015, applied to the RBI seeking approval for renunciation of Share Rights by:


	(a) shareholders resident in India to any person resident outside India (other than OCBs);


	(b) shareholders resident outside India (other than OCBs) to either any person resident in India or any other person resident outside India
	(other than OCBs).


	On March 30, 2015, we received approval from RBI for renunciation of Share Rights on the floor of the BSE by (a)
	shareholders resident in India to any person resident outside India; and (b) shareholders resident outside India to any person who is either resident in or outside India, subject to the offer price to non-residents not being less than the offer
	price to a resident shareholder. However, non-resident Indian shareholders holding non-repatriable shares may only renounce the Rights in favor of residents or other non-resident Indians, and where an OCB is involved, prior approval from RBI will be
	required.


	In accordance with applicable law, only existing non-resident shareholders may subscribe for Shares in addition to their
	initial entitlement as part of the Rights Offering.


	Investors through the Application Supported by Blocked Account, or ASBA, process can
	neither be renouncees nor can they renounce their entitlement to Ordinary Share Rights or A Ordinary Shares.




	Excess Applications




	All Shares not taken up in terms of the Rights Offering will be available for allocation to holders of Share Rights who wish to
	apply for a greater number of Shares than those initially offered to them in the Rights Offering. Accordingly, holders of Share Rights may apply for Shares in excess of the Shares initially allocated to them on the same terms and conditions.


	Applications for additional Shares by certificated shareholders may only be made by indicating the requirement in the place provided for
	additional Shares in Part A of the composite application form.


	Holders of dematerialized Shares who wish to apply for excess Shares
	should instruct their Indian Depository or broker, in terms of the agreement entered into between them and their Indian Depository or broker, as to the number of additional Shares for which they wish to apply.


	An advertisement published in newspapers published in the Republic of India, within 10 days of completion of various activities stating, among
	other things, the results of the Rights Offering and the basis of allocation. An


	 


	S-56







	Table of Contents



	announcement stating the results of the Rights Offering and the basis of allocation of any additional offered Shares is also expected to be made in the United States on or about May 15,
	2015.


	The pool of Shares available to meet excess applications will be allocated as follows in order of priority:


	 




	 


	(1)


	holders whose fractional entitlements are being disregarded would be given preference in allotment of one additional Share each if they apply for additional Shares which will occur if there are any unsubscribed Shares
	after full allotment to those holders of Share Rights who have applied for their Share Rights either in full or in part and also to the renouncee(s) who have applied for Shares renounced in their favor, in full or in part; if number of Shares
	required for allotment are more than the number of Shares available after full allotment, the allotment will be made on a fair and equitable basis in consultation with the Indian stock exchange(s) and will not be a preferential allotment;




	 




	 


	(2)


	allotment to the shareholders who have subscribed for all of the respective Share Rights and have applied for additional Shares which will be made as far as possible on an equitable basis having due regard to the number
	of Shares held by them on the record date. The allotment of such Shares will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors in consultation with the Indian stock exchange(s), as a part of the Rights Offering and will not be a preferential
	allotment;




	 




	 


	(3)


	allotment to renouncees who have subscribed for all the Shares renounced in their favor and have applied for additional Shares which will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors in consultation with the
	Indian stock exchange(s), as a part of the Rights Offering and will not be a preferential allotment; and




	 




	 


	(4)


	allotment to any other person that our board of directors as it may deem fit; and the decision of our board of directors in this regard shall be final and binding.




	If all the Shares are subscribed for in the Rights Offering, no additional Shares will be made available for allocation to applicants.


	We will issue and dispatch allotment advice/ demat credit and/or letters of regret along with refund order or credit the allotted securities
	to the respective beneficiary accounts, if any, within a period of 15 days from the expiration of the Share Rights subscription period. In case of failure to do so, we shall pay interest at such rate and within such time as specified under
	applicable law.


	Investors residing at centers where clearing houses are managed by the RBI will get refunds through National Electronic
	Clearing Service, or NECS, except where investors have not provided the details required to send electronic refunds.


	In case of those
	investors who have opted to receive their Rights in dematerialized form using electronic credit under the depository system, advice regarding their credit of the securities shall be given separately. Investors to whom refunds are made through
	electronic transfer of funds will be sent a letter through ordinary post intimating them about the mode of credit of refund within 15 days of the expiration of the Share Rights subscription period.


	In case of those investors who have opted to receive their Rights in physical form and with respect to whom we issue letters of allotment, the
	corresponding share certificates will be prepared within two months from the date of allotment thereof or such extended time as may be approved under Section 56 of the Companies Act, 2013 or other applicable provisions, if any. Investors are
	required to preserve such letters of allotment, which would be exchanged later for the share certificate.


	The letter of allotment/ refund
	order would be sent by registered post/ speed post to the sole/ first investors Indian registered address provided. Such refund orders would be payable at par at all places where the applications were originally accepted. The same would be
	marked Account Payee only and would be drawn in favor of the sole/ first investor. Adequate funds would be made available to the Registrar for this purpose.

	dividend or interest and any other disbursement, shall be credited to such accounts and will be made after deducting bank charges or commission in U.S. dollars, at the rate of exchange prevailing at such time. We will not be responsible for any loss
	on account of exchange rate fluctuations for conversion of the Indian rupee amount into U.S. dollars. The letter of allotment will be sent by registered post / speed post to the Indian address of the non-resident shareholders or investors as
	provided to us.




	Share Subscription Period




	The Share Rights may be exercised during the period from April 17, 2015 to close of business on May 2, 2015, referred to hereinafter
	as the share subscription period. Dematerialized shareholders are urged to consult their Indian Depository or broker regarding the procedure they need to follow for the acceptance, sale of renunciation of their entitlement without delay in case
	their Indian Depository or broker is unable to act immediately. The ADS Rights Offering subscription period ends before the Share subscription period. Ordinary Share Rights and A Ordinary Share Rights that are not exercised prior to the
	end of the subscription period will expire valueless without any compensation to holders.




	Share Subscription Price




	The share subscription price is Rs.450 per Ordinary Share subscribed and Rs. 271 per A Ordinary Share subscribed, which in
	U.S. dollars was equivalent to US$7.17 and US$4.32, respectively on March 27, 2015, using an exchange rate of Rs.62.7825 per U.S. dollar (the opening exchange rate as published by Bloomberg L.P. at 7:29 a.m., New York City time, on
	March 27, 2015).

	ADDITIONAL MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES



	This discussion supplements the discussion contained under the caption Taxation in the accompanying base prospectus,
	which is incorporated by reference herein, and should be read in conjunction therewith.


	This discussion describes the material U.S.
	federal income tax consequences of the receipt and subsequent disposition or exercise of ADS Rights and the issuance of ADSs to the holders of ADS Rights. This discussion applies to you only if you acquire ADS Rights pursuant to the ADS Rights
	Offering, acquire new ADSs through exercise of ADS Rights, and hold those ADS Rights or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes. This section does not apply to you if you are a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules,
	including:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a dealer in securities,




	 




	 


	


	 


	a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings,




	 




	 


	


	 


	a tax-exempt organization,




	 




	 


	


	 


	a life insurance company,




	 




	 


	


	 


	a person liable for alternative minimum tax,




	 




	 


	


	 


	a person that actually or constructively owns 10% or more of our voting stock,




	 




	 


	


	 


	a person that holds ADS Rights or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction,




	 




	 


	


	 


	a person that purchases or sells ADS Rights or ADSs as part of a wash sale for tax purposes, or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a U.S. holder (as defined in the accompanying base prospectus) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.




	The following discussion addresses only the material U.S. federal income tax consequences for persons that are U.S. holders (as
	defined in the accompanying base prospectus).


	The following discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
	administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations, all as of the date hereof, changes to any of which may affect the tax consequences described herein, possibly with retroactive effect


	If an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds ADS Rights or ADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment
	of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you hold ADS Rights or ADSs as a partner in a partnership, you should consult your tax advisor with regard to the U.S. federal income tax
	treatment of an investment in ADS Rights or ADSs.


	 




	You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the U.S. federal, state, local and the Indian and other
	tax consequences of owning and disposing of ADS Rights or ADSs in your particular circumstances.




	This discussion addresses only
	U.S. federal income taxation.




	Characterization of the Issuance of ADS Rights




	Based on the facts and circumstances relating to this ADS Rights Offering, we believe and intend to take the position that the issuance of ADS
	Rights should be treated as a non-taxable event for recipients of the ADS


	 


	S-64







	Table of Contents



	Rights for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the discussion below so assumes. However, the treatment of the issuance of ADS Rights to our ADS holders pursuant to this ADS Rights Offering as a
	non-taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes is not free from doubt, and it is possible that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service may take the position that the issuance of ADS Rights is a taxable event for recipients of such ADS
	Rights.




	Receipt of ADS Rights




	You should not recognize gain or loss upon the receipt of ADS Rights pursuant to the ADS Rights Offering.




	Basis and Holding Period of ADS Rights




	Your basis in ADS Rights you receive should be zero, unless either (i) the fair market value of your ADS Rights on the date such ADS
	Rights are distributed equals 15% or more of the value of the existing ADSs with respect to which you receive ADS Rights or (ii) you elect to allocate to ADS Rights a portion of your basis in the existing ADSs with respect to which you will
	have received ADS Rights. If either of these situations applies, basis will be allocated in proportion to the relative fair market value of the existing ADSs and ADS Rights distributed thereon on the date the ADS Rights are distributed. If you wish
	to make the election to allocate a portion of your basis in the existing ADSs to the ADS Rights, you must attach a statement to this effect to your U.S. federal income tax return for the tax year in which you receive the ADS Rights. The election
	will apply to all ADS Rights you receive pursuant to this ADS Rights Offering and, once made, will be irrevocable.


	In the event that the
	value of the ADS Rights is less than 15% of the value of the existing ADSs with respect to which they are distributed, you should consult your own tax advisors regarding the advisability of making such an election.


	Your holding period with respect to your ADS Rights will include your holding period in the existing ADSs with respect to which your ADS
	Rights are distributed.




	Sale or Other Disposition of ADS Rights




	Subject to the Passive Foreign Investment Company, or PFIC, rules described in the accompanying base prospectus, you will recognize capital
	gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of ADS Rights (including upon sale or other disposition of ADS Rights by the ADS Depository on behalf of owners of ADSs that are not Eligible ADS Rights Holders) in an amount equal to the difference
	between the amount realized on the sale or other disposition and your tax basis, determined in U.S. dollars, in your ADS Rights.


	If you
	are a non-corporate U.S. holder, your capital gain is generally taxed at preferential rates where you have a holding period greater than one year in the applicable ADS Rights at the time of the sale or other disposition. Certain limitations exist on
	your ability to deduct capital losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Your gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of ADS Rights will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation
	purposes.


	Subject to the discussion below regarding ADS Rights that are traded on an established securities market, your amount realized
	on a sale or other disposition of ADS Rights for an amount in a currency other than the U.S. dollar (a foreign currency) will be the U.S. dollar value of this amount on the date of sale or disposition. To the extent the amount realized
	differs from the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency received on the settlement date, you will recognize ordinary gain or loss. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit
	limitation purposes. If you are a cash basis taxpayer and sell ADS Rights that are traded on an established securities market (or if you are an accrual basis taxpayer that so elects), your amount realized will be based on the exchange rate in effect
	on the settlement date for the sale. If you are an accrual basis taxpayer and wish to make such election, you must apply it consistently from year to year and cannot revoke it without the consent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service.


	 


	S-65







	Table of Contents



	As discussed under the caption Taxation in the accompanying base prospectus, capital
	gains that you realize upon a sale or other disposition of ADS Rights may be subject to tax in India. You may be entitled to a foreign tax credit under the U.S. federal income tax laws for Indian taxes paid upon a sale or other disposition of ADS
	Rights. You should consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit in respect of any such taxes imposed.




	Lapse of
	ADS Rights




	If you allow your ADS Rights to lapse without selling or exercising them and you do not receive any proceeds, you will
	not recognize any loss upon expiration of such ADS Rights. If you had allocated to such ADS Rights a portion of your tax basis in your existing ADSs, that basis should be re-allocated to the existing ADSs.




	Exercise of ADS Rights




	You will
	not realize gain or loss upon the receipt of new ADSs pursuant to the exercise of ADS Rights. Your basis in such new ADSs will equal the sum of (i) the U.S. dollar value of the ADSs subscription price determined at the spot rate on the date of
	exercise and (ii) your basis, if any, in ADS Rights exercised to obtain such ADSs. Your holding period in each new ADSs acquired through the exercise of ADS Rights will generally begin with and include the date of exercise. However, for
	purposes of the PFIC rules described below, your holding period in each new ADS acquired through the exercise of ADS Rights generally will include your holding period in your ADS Rights. For a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax
	consequences of owning ADSs see the discussion contained under the caption Taxation in the accompanying base prospectus.




	Passive
	Foreign Investment Company Rules




	Your ADS Rights and any new ADSs you receive if you choose to exercise your ADS Rights, are
	subject to the PFIC rules. We believe that your ADS Rights and ADSs should not be treated as shares of a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to
	change. For a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the PFIC rules, see the discussion contained under the caption TaxationPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules in the accompanying base prospectus.




	Information Reporting and Backup Withholding




	If you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, information reporting requirements generally will apply to the payment of proceeds to you from the sale

	As part of the underwriting arrangement described above, each of the Underwriters may provide marketing or
	solicitation services conducted in the United States in connection with the Rights Offering to (1) ADS holders in the United States, and (2) holders of Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares.


	The underwriting agreement relating to the Rights Offering for Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares provides that the obligations
	of the several Underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of any shares under the Rights Offering are subject to certain conditions. The underwriting agreement also provides that if an Underwriter defaults, the purchase amounts of non-defaulting
	underwriters may be increased or the offering may be terminated.


	We have agreed with the Underwriters that, for a period of 90 days from
	the date of listing of the Shares, we will not, without the prior written consent of the Underwriters, issue any Shares or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for the Shares or publicly announce any intention to do so
	during the aforesaid period. However, we may, issue securities on account of conversion of financial instruments outstanding as of March 30, 2015 in connection with the Rights Offering.

	referred to as the Locked-in Shares, or publicly announce an intention with respect to any of the foregoing, (B) enter into any swap or any other agreement or any transaction that transfers, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of
	the economic consequences of ownership of the Locked-in Shares or publicly announce an intention to enter into any such transaction, whether any such swap or transaction described in clause (A) or (B) hereof is to be settled by delivery of
	Locked-in Shares in cash or otherwise.

	liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.


	Some of the Underwriters are expected to make offers and sales both in and
	outside the United States through their respective selling agents. Any offers and sales in the United States will be conducted by broker-dealers registered with the SEC. Certain of the Underwriters are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and
	therefore may not offer or sell any of our Shares or ADRs in the United States or to U.S. persons in connection with this Rights Offering. The Underwriters have agreed not to sell the devolved Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares
	subscribed for by the Underwriters as part of the Rights Offering other than on the Indian stock exchanges.

	agreed not to enter into any hedge, short-sale or similar transaction with respect to Ordinary Shares, the A Ordinary Shares, the ADSs or any related rights, during the period from March 26, 2015 until the Allotment Date.


	The Underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include
	sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services.


	Certain of the Underwriters or their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may in the future perform, various
	financial advisory, investment banking, commercial banking or other services for us, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. Certain of the Underwriters or their respective affiliates have extended loans to us, which are
	being repaid with the proceeds of this Rights Offering. See Use of Proceeds.


	In the ordinary course of their various business
	activities, the Underwriters or their respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps
	and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to our assets, securities and/or instruments (directly, as collateral securing other
	obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with us. The Underwriters or their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express
	independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments.

	Limited, because, among other factors, the Trusts would not be eligible to make such invesment under the provisions of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950, as amended. As renunciation by the Trusts is being undertaken due to operation of law, it

	vehicles produced by us are in operation in India as of the date hereof. We have a substantial presence in India and also have global operations in connection with production and sale of Jaguar and Land Rover premium brand passenger vehicles.


	We were incorporated on September 1, 1945 as a public limited liability company under the Indian Companies Act VII of 1913 as Tata
	Locomotive and Engineering Company Limited and we received a certificate of commencement of business on November 20, 1945. Our name was changed to Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited on September 24, 1960, and to Tata Motors
	Limited on July 29, 2003. Tata Motors Limited is incorporated and domiciled in India. We commenced operations as a steam locomotive manufacturer. This business was discontinued in 1971. Since 1954, we have been manufacturing automotive
	vehicles. The automotive vehicle business commenced with the manufacture of commercial vehicles under financial and technical collaboration with Daimler-Benz AG (now Daimler AG) of Germany. This agreement ended in 1969. We produced only commercial
	vehicles until 1991, when we started producing passenger vehicles as well.


	In June 2008, we acquired the Jaguar Land Rover business from
	Ford Motor Company. Jaguar Land Rover is a global automotive business, which designs, manufactures and sells Jaguar luxury sedans and sports cars and Land Rover premium all-terrain vehicles as well as related parts, accessories and merchandise. The
	Jaguar Land Rover business has internationally recognized brands, a product portfolio of award winning luxury performance cars and premium all-terrain vehicles, brand specific global distribution networks and research and development capabilities.
	As a part of our acquisition of the Jaguar Land Rover business, we acquired three major manufacturing facilities located in Halewood, Solihull and Castle Bromwich and two advanced design and engineering facilities located at Whitley and Gaydon, all
	in the United Kingdom, together with national sales companies in several countries.


	In September 2004, we became the first company from
	Indias automotive sector to be listed on the NYSE. Our ADSs are traded on the NYSE under the symbol TTM. Our Ordinary Shares and A Ordinary Shares are traded on the BSE under the codes 500570 and 570001, respectively,
	and the NSE under the symbols TATAMOTORS and TATAMTRDVR, respectively.

	DESCRIPTION OF ORDINARY SHARES AND A ORDINARY SHARES




	The following description of our share capital is a summary of the material terms of our Memorandum and Articles of Association
	and Indian corporate law regarding our Shares and the holders thereof. They may not contain all of the information that is important to you. To understand them fully, you should read our Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association, as
	amended, copies of which are filed with the SEC as an exhibit to our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended March 31, 2005, filed on September 28, 2005 and our annual report on 20-F for the year ended March 31, 2014, filed on
	July 31, 2014. The following description is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Memorandum and Articles of Association and applicable law.



	The rights of shareholders described in this section are available only to our shareholders. For the purposes of this prospectus, a
	shareholder means a person who holds our certificated Shares or is recorded as a beneficial owner of our Shares with a depository pursuant to the Depositories Act, 1996, as amended, or the Depositories Act. Investors who purchase the
	ADSs will not be our shareholders and will not be directly entitled to the rights conferred on our shareholders by our Articles of Association or the rights conferred on shareholders of an Indian company by Indian law. Our Shares are in registered
	physical form as well as non-physical or book-entry form. Investors are entitled to receive dividends and to exercise the right to vote in accordance with the deposit agreement. For additional information on the ADSs, see Description of
	American Depositary Shares.


	INVESTORS WHO PURCHASE THE ADSs IN ANY OFFERING MUST LOOK SOLELY TO THE DEPOSITARY BANK FOR THE PAYMENT
	OF DIVIDENDS, FOR THE EXERCISE OF VOTING RIGHTS ATTACHING TO THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THEIR ADSs AND FOR ALL OTHER RIGHTS ARISING IN RESPECT OF THE SHARES.



	Authorized and Issued Share Capital



	Our
	authorized share capital is Rs.39 billion divided into:


	 




	 


	


	 


	3.5 billion Ordinary Shares of par value Rs.2 each, of which 2,736,713,122 are issued, subscribed and fully paid, 484,470 are issued but held in abeyance and 68,740 are issued but partially paid up as of the date of
	this prospectus;




	 




	 


	


	 


	1 billion A Ordinary Shares of par value Rs.2 each, of which 481,966,945 are issued, subscribed and fully paid and 239,570 are issued but held in abeyance as of the date of this prospectus; and

	300 million Convertible Cumulative Preference Shares of par value Rs.100 each; however, the Convertible Cumulative Preference Shares have not been issued.




	None of our Shares are held by or on behalf of TML India or any subsidiary of TML India.



	Alteration of Share Capital and Pre-Emptive Rights



	Our authorized capital is set forth in Clause V of our Memorandum of Association and may be increased by a special resolution passed by our
	shareholders.


	In accordance with the Articles of Association, we may increase our subscribed share capital by issuing new shares on such
	terms and with such rights as we, by action of shareholders in a general meeting, determine. Such shares are generally required to be offered to existing shareholders on the applicable record date in proportion to the amount paid-up on these shares
	at that date. However, we may also offer such shares to any persons if authorized pursuant to a special resolution. The issuance of shares upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes has been duly approved by a special resolution of our
	shareholders and our shareholders have waived their pre-emptive rights with respect to these shares.


	Our Articles of Association provide
	that, by a special resolution passed at the general meeting, we may consolidate or subdivide our share capital, convert all or any of our fully paid-up shares into stock and re-convert


	 


	-10-







	Table of Contents



	that stock into fully paid-up shares or cancel shares which have not been taken up by any person. We may also from time to time by special resolution reduce its capital. Our board of directors,
	which we refer to hereafter as the Board of Directors or the Board, may also alter our share capital through a buy-back of shares as prescribed under the Securities and Exchange Board of India, or SEBI, regulations and guidelines and the Companies
	Act. Please see Acquisition of Our Own Shares for further details on our ability to buy back shares.


	Under the
	Companies Act, as well as our Articles of Association, if our share capital is divided into different classes of shares, all or any of the rights or privileges attached to each class of shares may be varied, modified, abrogated or dealt with, with
	the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-fourths of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the issued shares of that class. Our Articles of
	Association further provide that the rights conferred upon the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferred or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of the issue of the shares of that class, be deemed
	to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares ranking

	pari passu

	thereto.


	The Companies Act allows a company to issue
	shares with differential rights as to dividends, voting or otherwise subject to the authority in its articles of association and other conditions prescribed under the applicable law. In this regard, the applicable laws in India provide that a
	company may issue shares with differential voting rights, if:


	 




	 


	


	 


	such issuance is authorized by its shareholders through a postal ballot;

	the company has distributable profits in terms of the Companies Act for a period of three financial years;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the company has not defaulted in filing financial statements and annual returns for the immediately preceding three years;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the articles of association of such company allow for the issuance of such shares with differential voting rights; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	certain other conditions set forth in the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 are fulfilled.




	In accordance with our Articles of Association, we may issue Ordinary Shares with differential rights as to voting and/or dividends up to an
	amount not exceeding 25% of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company or such other limit as may be prescribed by applicable laws, rules or regulations. An amendment to the Companies (Share Capital and Debenture) Rules, 2014 on
	June 18, 2014 clarified that the Companies Act, 1956 continues to govern equity shares with differential rights issued thereunder.



	Convertible
	Securities/Warrants



	We may issue from time to time debentures that are partly and fully convertible into shares at the time of
	redemption, provided that such issuance is approved by a special resolution passed at a general meeting of our company as prescribed under the Companies Act.



	Calls on Shares



	Under the Companies Act,
	as well as our Articles of Association, the Board of Directors may from time to time make such calls as they think fit upon the members of our company in respect of all moneys unpaid on the shares held by them respectively and each member is
	required to pay the amount of every call so made on them to our company. Under the Companies Act, a capital call on a particular class of shares shall be made on a uniform basis on all shares falling under such class.

	Share Options



	We have not issued any share options to our directors, officers and employees and no options remain outstanding as of the date of this
	prospectus.



	Dividends



	Subject to
	certain conditions laid down under the Companies Act, no dividend can be declared or paid by a company for any fiscal year except out of the profits of the company for that fiscal year and/or any previous fiscal year(s) that remain undistributed or
	out of money provided by the Government of India or an Indian state government for payment of dividends by the company through a guarantee given by that government.


	Under the Companies Act, unless the board of directors of a company recommends the payment of a dividend, the shareholders at a general
	meeting have no power to declare any dividend. Under our Articles of Association, the shareholders at a general meeting may declare a lower, but not higher, dividend than that recommended by the Board. Dividends are generally declared as a
	percentage of the par value. The Board may declare and pay interim dividends.


	Under the Companies Act, dividends can only be paid in cash
	to shareholders listed on the register of shareholders on the date which is specified as the record date or book closure date. No shareholder is entitled to a dividend while any lien in respect of unpaid calls on any of their
	shares is outstanding.


	Under the Companies Act, in the event of inadequacy or absence of profits during a fiscal year, a company may pay
	a dividend not exceeding the average rates at which dividend was declared by it in the immediately preceding three years, calculated on a standalone basis. Dividends payable out of the undistributed, accumulated profits of a company from any prior
	fiscal year(s) should not exceed 10% of the paid-up capital and free reserves as stated in the latest audited financial statement, after setting off losses incurred in the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared, on a standalone basis. The
	balance of reserves after such withdrawal must not be below 15% of the paid-up share capital as stated in the latest audited financial statements on a standalone basis. Furthermore, no company may declare a dividend unless carried over previous
	losses and depreciation not provided for in previous years are set off against profits of the company of the current year on a standalone basis.


	The holders of A Ordinary Shares are entitled to receive dividends for any fiscal year at a rate that is five percentage points
	more than the aggregate rate of dividend declared on Ordinary Shares for that fiscal year.



	Capitalization of Reserves and Issue of Bonus Shares



	Our Articles of Association permit us to act by a resolution of our shareholders at a general meeting to capitalize amounts standing
	to the credit of reserves or securities premium by issuing fully paid bonus shares (also referred to as a share dividend) or by crediting unpaid amounts on shares that have not been fully paid-up. However, any amount standing to the credit of a
	share premium account or capital redemption reserve account may only be applied in crediting payment of capital on shares of our company to be issued to shareholders as fully paid bonus shares. Bonus shares must be issued pro rata to the amount of
	capital paid-up on existing shareholdings. Any issue of bonus shares would be subject to the guidelines issued by the SEBI and the provisions of the Companies Act.



	General Meetings of Shareholders





	Annual General
	Meetings




	We are required to hold an annual general meeting each year and not more than 15 months should elapse between each annual
	general meeting. The annual general meeting should be held within a period of six months from the date of closing of the fiscal year, unless extended by a period not exceeding three months by the Registrar of Companies at our request for any special
	reason.

	Methods of Voting




	At a general
	meeting, unless a poll is demanded or voting is carried out electronically (including when mandated by Indian law), resolutions at a general meeting are decided by a show of hands, where each member present has one vote. Before or upon the

	Table of Contents



	hands, a poll may be ordered to be taken by the chairman of the meeting or demanded by shareholder(s) holding at least one-tenth of the voting rights in respect of the resolution or aggregate
	paid-up capital of at least Rs.500,000. Upon a poll, each shareholder entitled to vote and present in person or by proxy shall have voting rights in the same proportion as the capital paid-up on each share held by such holder bears to the total
	paid-up capital of our company.


	Under the provisions of the revised Equity Listing Agreement entered into with the BSE and the NSE,


	every listed company in India is required to provide its shareholders with the facility to exercise their right to vote by electronic means either at a general meeting of the company or by means of a postal ballot. Furthermore, pursuant to
	the Companies Act, any company having not less than 1,000 shareholders shall provide its members facility to exercise right at general meetings by electronic means. Accordingly, our company provides such electronic voting facility to all of our
	shareholders.


	Holders of ADSs are not entitled to attend or vote at general meetings. Holders of ADSs may exercise voting rights with
	respect to the Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs only in accordance with the provisions of our deposit agreement relating to the ADSs and Indian law. See Description of American Depositary SharesVoting Rights for additional
	details on the rights of holders of ADSs.


	Where a resolution is put to vote on a poll, such voting entitlement (excluding fractions, if
	any), will be applicable to holders of A Ordinary Shares. As per the terms of issue, holders of the outstanding A Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to one vote for every ten A Ordinary Shares held. Where a
	resolution is put to vote in the meeting and is to be decided on a show of hands, the holders of A Ordinary Shares shall be entitled to the same number of votes as available to holders of Ordinary Shares.




	Ordinary and Special Resolutions




	Ordinary resolutions may be passed by simple majority of those shareholders present and voting at the meeting. Certain matters are required to

	Voting by Proxy




	A person may act as proxy on behalf of members not exceeding 50 and holding in the aggregate not more than 10% of our total share capital
	carrying voting rights, provided that a member holding more than 10% of our


	 


	-14-







	Table of Contents



	total share capital carrying voting rights may appoint a single person as a proxy and such person shall not act as a proxy for any other person or shareholder. A shareholder may exercise his or
	her voting rights by proxy to be given in the form prescribed under the Companies Act. The instrument appointing a proxy is required to be lodged with us at least 48 hours before the time of the meeting. A shareholder may, by a single power of
	attorney, grant a general power of representation regarding several general meetings of shareholders. Any of our shareholders may appoint a proxy. A corporate shareholder is also entitled to nominate a representative to attend and vote on its behalf
	at general meetings. A proxy may not vote except on a poll and does not have a right to speak at meetings. An authorized representative shall be entitled to exercise same rights and powers, including right to vote by proxy and by postal ballot on
	behalf of a body corporate which it represents.



	Election of Directors



	Under our Articles of Association, the number of our directors may not be less than three or more than 15. The Board of Directors is
	constituted by 10 members as of the date of this prospectus. Appointments of new directors are made through a majority vote of the full Board and approved by a simple majority of our shareholders in attendance at each years annual general
	meeting provided that a quorum is met.




	Qualification




	Under our Articles of Association, a director is not required to hold any qualification shares. Our Articles of Association do not prescribe an
	age limit for the retirement of the directors. As per the Revised Guidelines (2012) adopted by our Board, executive directors must retire at the age of 65, independent directors must retire at the age of 75 and other non-executive directors
	must retire at the age of 70 (subject to them meeting the transition clause). Moreover, as per the Board guidelines, the maximum tenure in case of non-executive directors is nine years and the Board may, based on, among other things, the merit and
	contribution of each director, grant further tenure.


	In addition, under the Companies Act and the Equity Listing Agreement, every listed
	company is required to appoint at least one female director on the board of directors of the company by April 1, 2015. Our company is in compliance with this requirement as of the date of this prospectus.




	Term




	At the annual general
	meeting in each year, one-third of the directors, being those who have held their position the longest since their appointment, retire by rotation. Under the Companies Act, an independent director holds office for a term of up to five consecutive
	years on the board of a company and would not be liable to retire by rotation. An independent director would be eligible to be re-appointed for an additional five-year term upon passing of a special resolution by our company. Re-appointment of an
	independent director is effective upon fulfilling the conditions to appoint a director as described above. No independent director may hold office for more than two consecutive terms of five years each. An independent director may become eligible
	for re-appointment after the expiration of three years of ceasing to become an independent director, provided that he/she is not directly or indirectly associated with our company during such three-year period.



	Register of Shareholders and Record Dates



	We are obliged to maintain a register of shareholders at our registered office or at some other place in Mumbai. The register and index of our
	beneficial owners maintained by a depository under the Depositories Act, 1996 is deemed to be the index of members and register of shareholders. We recognize as shareholders only those persons who appear on our register of shareholders and we cannot
	recognize any person holding any share or part of it upon any trust, express, implied or constructive, except as permitted by law. In the case of shares held in physical form, we register transfers of shares on the register of shareholders upon
	lodgment of the share

	Table of Contents



	transfer form duly stamped and completed in all respects accompanied by a share certificate, or if there is no certificate, the letter of allotment in respect of shares transferred together with
	duly stamped and completed transfer forms. In respect of electronic transfers, the depository transfers shares by entering the name of the purchaser in its books as the beneficial owner of the shares. In turn, we enter the name of the depository in
	our records as the registered owner of the shares. The beneficial owner is entitled to all the rights and benefits as well as the liabilities with respect to the shares that are held by the depository. This activity is done by the registrar and
	transfer agent of our company.


	For the purpose of determining the shareholders, the register may be closed for periods not exceeding
	45 days each year and not exceeding 30 days at any one time, subject to prior notice of at least seven days or such lesser period as may be specified by SEBI for listed companies in India. In order to determine the shareholders entitled to
	dividends, we generally keep the register of shareholders closed for approximately 21 days each year. Under the listing regulations of the stock exchanges on which our outstanding shares are listed, we may, upon at least seven working
	days advance notice to such stock exchanges, set a record date and/or close the register of shareholders in order to ascertain the identity of shareholders entitled to the dividend. The trading of shares and the delivery of certificates in
	respect thereof may continue while the register of shareholders is closed.



	Indian Annual Report and Financial Results



	Our Indian GAAP audited financial statements for the relevant fiscal year, the directors report and the auditors report, which are
	collectively referred to hereafter as the Indian Annual Report, must be prepared before the annual general meeting. The Indian Annual Report also includes other financial information, a corporate governance section, a management discussion and
	analysis report, and general shareholders information and is made available for inspection at our registered office during normal working hours for 21 days prior to our annual general meeting.


	Under the Companies Act, we are required to file an annual general meeting report with the Registrar of Companies within 30 days from the date
	of the annual general meeting. As required under listing agreements with the applicable stock exchanges, copies of the annual general meeting report are required to be simultaneously sent to all the stock exchanges on which our shares are listed.
	The annual general meeting report details shall include, among other things, the number of shareholders attending the meeting, the business that was transacted, the time and location of the meeting, a confirmation of quorum and a summary of the
	proceedings of the meeting. We must also publish our financial results in at least one national English language daily newspaper in India, one newspaper published in the language of the region where our registered office is situated, as well as on
	our website.


	We submit information, including our Indian Annual Report and half-yearly financial statements, in accordance with the
	requirements of our listing agreements with the BSE and the NSE.



	Transfer of Shares



	Shares held through depositories are transferred in book-entry form or in electronic form in accordance with SEBI regulations, which govern the
	functioning of the depositories and participants, prescribe record keeping requirements and safeguards to be followed in this system. Transfers of beneficial ownership of shares held through a depository are exempt from stamp duty. We have entered
	into an agreement for these depository services with National Securities Depository Limited and the Central Depository Services (India) Limited.


	The SEBI requires that all investors hold our Shares in book-entry form for trading and settlement purposes, except for transactions that are
	not made on a stock exchange and transactions that are not required to be reported to the stock exchange.

	Table of Contents



	Our Shares are freely transferable, subject only to the provisions of the Companies Act under
	which, if a transfer of securities is in contravention of any of the provisions of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 or the Companies Act or any other law for the time being in
	force, the Company Law Board, or CLB, may, on an application made by the depository, company, depository participant, the holder of the securities or the SEBI, direct any company or a depository to set right the contravention and rectify its
	register or records concerned. If a company without sufficient cause refuses to register a transfer of Shares within one month from the date on which the instrument of transfer is delivered to the company, the transferee may appeal to the CLB
	seeking to register the transfer of Shares. The CLB may after hearing the parties, either dismiss the appeal, or by order direct that the transfer or transmission shall be registered by the company and the company shall comply with such order within
	a period of ten days of the receipt of the order; or direct rectification of the register and also direct the company to pay damages, if any, sustained by any party aggrieved.


	Pursuant to the Equity Listing Agreement with the BSE and the NSE, in the event we have not effected the transfer of Shares within 15 days or
	where we have failed to communicate to the transferee any valid objection to the transfer within the stipulated time period of 15 days, we are required to compensate the aggrieved party for the opportunity loss caused during the period of the delay.


	The Companies Act provides that the securities or other interest of any member of a public company (such as our company) shall be freely
	transferable. Our Articles of Association provide for restrictions on the transfer of shares, including granting power to the Board of Directors in certain circumstances to refuse to register or acknowledge transfer of shares or other securities
	issued by us. However, under the Companies Act these transfer restrictions are not enforceable, however, transfer restrictions may be enforceable under contract law as between two or more parties to a contract or an arrangement.



	Acquisition of Our Own Shares



	Under the
	Companies Act, companies may purchase their own shares or other specified securities out of their free reserves or their securities premium account or the proceeds of any shares or other specified securities (other than the kind of shares or other
	specified securities proposed to be bought back) subject to the following conditions:

	the ratio of the aggregate of secured and unsecured debts owed by the company after buy-back is not more than twice the paid-up capital and its free reserves;

	all the shares or other specified securities for buy-back are fully paid-up;

	


	 


	the buy-back in respect of shares or other specified securities other than those specified in clause (vi) above is in accordance with the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules 2014.




	The condition mentioned in clause (ii) above would not be applicable if the buy-back is for less than 10% of the total paid-up equity
	capital and free reserves of the company provided it has been authorized by the board of directors of the company. A company buying back its securities is required to extinguish and physically destroy the securities so bought back within seven days
	of the date of completion of the buy-back. Moreover, a company buying back its securities is not permitted to buy-back any securities for a period of one year from the buy-back

	or to issue further securities of the same kind for six months except by way of bonus issue or in the discharge of subsisting obligations such as conversion of warrants, share option schemes,
	sweat equity or conversion of preference shares or debentures into equity. Every buy-back has to be completed within a period of one year from the date of passing of the special resolution or resolution of the board of directors, as the case may be.


	A company is also prohibited from purchasing its own shares or specified securities through any subsidiary company or through any
	investment company, or if the company has defaulted on the repayment of deposit or interest, redemption of debentures or preference shares, payment of dividend to a shareholder, repayment of any term loan or interest payable thereon to any financial
	institution or bank, or in the event of non-compliance with other provisions of the Companies Act. However, if the default in relation to any such repayment has been remedied and a period of three years has lapsed after the default has been
	remedied, buy-back is not prohibited.



	Liquidation Rights



	Subject to our statutory duties, the rights of creditors, workmen and of the holders of any other shares entitled by their terms of issue to
	preferential repayment over our shares,


	in the event of our winding-up, the holders of our shares are entitled to be repaid the amounts of capital paid-up or credited as paid-up on such shares, or in case of shortfall, proportionately. All
	surplus assets after payment of our statutory duties, amounts due to workmen, the holders of any preference shares and other creditors belong to the holders of the equity shares in proportion to the amount paid-up or credited as paid-up on these
	shares respectively at the commencement of the winding-up.

	Holders of A Ordinary Shares are entitled to enjoy all rights and privileges that are enjoyed by holders of Ordinary Shares

	Shares held. Fractional voting rights of A Ordinary Shareholders are disregarded. For example, if an A Ordinary Shareholder holds 39 A Ordinary Shares, such holder will be entitled to three votes. If an
	A Ordinary Shareholder holds less than ten Ordinary Shares, such holder will not be entitled to vote on a poll. The class of Ordinary Shareholders includes Ordinary Shareholders and A Ordinary Shareholders.

	DESCRIPTION OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES



	On March 27, 2015, there were 2,736,713,122 Ordinary Shares outstanding. A total of 582,239,180 Ordinary Shares, representing 21.28% of all
	outstanding Ordinary Shares, were directly held by Citibank, N.A., as depositary (the depositary) for our ADS program, or by its custodian, Citibank, N.A., Mumbai Branch. As certain of the Ordinary Shares and ADSs are held by nominees,
	the number of record holders may not be representative of the number of beneficial owners. A beneficial owner includes anyone who has the power to receive the economic benefit of ownership of the securities. ADRs evidencing ADSs are deliverable by
	Citibank, N.A., as depositary, pursuant to the Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2004, entered into by and among our company, Citibank, N.A., as depositary and the holders and beneficial owners from time to time
	of ADSs, pursuant to which the ADSs are issued, as amended and supplemented by Amendment No. 1 to Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement, dated as of December 16, 2009, hereinafter referred to as the deposit agreement. The
	depositarys principal office is located at 388 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013, U.S.A.


	The following is a summary of
	material provisions of the deposit agreement. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by reference to, the deposit agreement, including the form of ADR which is an exhibit to the deposit
	agreement. Terms used herein and not otherwise defined have the meanings set forth in the deposit agreement. ADSs are issuable pursuant to the deposit agreement. Each ADS represents five Ordinary Shares (together with any additional Ordinary Shares
	at any time deposited or deemed deposited under the deposit agreement and any and all other securities, cash and property received by the depositary or the custodian in respect thereof and at such time held under the deposit agreement, hereinafter
	referred to as the deposited securities). Only persons in whose names ADSs are registered on the books of the depositary will be treated by the depositary and us as ADS holders.



	Dividends and Distributions





	Distributions of Cash




	The depositary will distribute to ADS holders any U.S. dollars available to it and transferable to the United States (after
	conversion of currency into U.S. dollars as provided in the deposit agreement) resulting from a cash dividend or other cash distribution or the net proceeds of sale of any deposited securities on an averaged or other practicable basis in proportion
	to the number of ADSs held as of the applicable record date, subject to:


	 




	 


	


	 


	appropriate reductions for taxes, duties or other governmental charges withheld; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	deduction of the applicable fees, charges of and expenses of and incurred by the depositary, including those incurred in (i) converting any foreign currency into U.S. dollars, to the extent that it determines that
	the conversion may be made on a practicable basis and (ii) transferring foreign currency or U.S. dollars to the United States by such means as the depositary may determine to the extent that it determines that the transfer may be made on a
	practicable basis.






	Distributions of Shares




	In the case of a distribution in shares, the depositary may distribute ADSs representing the additional distributed shares to ADS holders in
	proportion to the number of ADSs held by them as of the applicable record date. In the alternative, and to the extent permissible under applicable law, the ADSs issued and outstanding after the record date shall also represent rights and interests
	in the additional integral number of shares distributed. In each case, the distribution shall be subject to the payment by the ADS holder of applicable fees and charges of, and expenses incurred by the depositary, as well as applicable taxes. In
	lieu of delivering fractional ADSs, the depositary shall sell the number of Ordinary Shares or ADSs, as the case may be, represented by the aggregate of such fractions and distribute the net proceeds upon the terms of a cash distribution. In the
	event that the depositary determines that any distribution in property (including shares) is subject to any tax or other governmental charges which the depositary is obligated to withhold, or, where no registration statement with


	 


	-20-







	Table of Contents



	respect to such distribution has been declared effective under the Securities Act, the depositary may dispose of all or a portion of such property (including shares and rights to subscribe
	therefor) in such amounts and in such manner, including by public or private sale, as the depositary deems necessary and practicable, and the depositary shall distribute the net proceeds of any such sale (after deduction of taxes as well as fees and
	charges of, and expenses incurred by, the depositary) to ADS holders upon the terms of a cash distribution.




	Distributions of Rights




	In the case of a distribution of rights to subscribe for additional shares, the depositary will make such rights available to ADS holders only
	where we have has requested that such rights be made available to ADS holders and the depositary has determined that such distribution is lawful and reasonably practicable and has received satisfactory documentation from us. The depositary will
	establish procedures to distribute the rights (by means of warrants or otherwise) to the ADS holders and, upon payment of the subscription price and of the applicable fees and charges of, and expenses incurred by, the depositary and taxes, deliver
	ADSs upon valid exercise of such rights.


	If we request that the rights not be made available to ADS holders, the depositary determines
	that it is not reasonably practicable to make the rights available or the depositary fails to receive satisfactory documentation from us or any rights appear to be about to lapse, the depositary may sell such rights and the net proceeds of such sale
	will be distributed to the ADS holders upon the terms of a cash distribution if the depositary determines that such sale is lawful and reasonably practicable.


	The depositary will allow the rights to lapse if it is unable to sell them or make them available to ADS holders as provided above.


	There can be no assurance that ADS holders will be able to receive or exercise rights on the same terms and conditions as the holders of
	Ordinary Shares or at all. We have no obligation to file any registration statement in respect of any rights or shares or other securities to be acquired upon the exercise of such rights.




	Elective Distributions




	A
	distribution payable at the election of holders of Ordinary Shares in cash or in additional shares will be made available to ADS holders only where we have requested the same to be made available to ADS holders and the depositary has determined that
	such distribution is lawful and reasonably practicable and satisfactory documentation has been received. Depending on the ADS holders election, cash or additional ADSs will be distributed in accordance with the terms for distributions in cash
	or shares, as the case may be.


	If we request that the elective distribution not be made available to ADS holders or the depositary
	determines it not reasonably practicable, or does not receive satisfactory documentation from us to make the distribution so available, the depositary will distribute to the ADS holders, either cash or additional ADSs, to the extent permitted by
	law, as determined on the same basis as used in India to determine the type of distribution in respect of Ordinary Shares for which no election is made.


	There can be no assurance that ADS holders will receive elective distributions on the same terms and conditions as the holders of Ordinary
	Shares.




	Other Distributions




	In the case of distribution of property other than as described above, the depositary will make such distribution available to ADS holders only
	if we have requested the same to be made available and the depositary has determined that such distribution is lawful and reasonably practicable and has received satisfactory documentation from us. The depositary will distribute the property to the
	ADS holders in proportion to the number of ADSs held in such manner as it deems practicable upon receipt of payment of or net applicable fees and charges of the depositary or taxes withheld.


	 


	-21-







	Table of Contents



	If we request the depositary not to make such distribution or the depositary determines that such
	distribution is not reasonably practicable, or does not receive satisfactory documentation from us, the depositary will sell the property and distribute to the ADS holders net proceeds of such sale. If the depositary is unable to conduct such sale,
	it may dispose of such property in any way it deems reasonably practicable and distribute the net proceeds to the holders. Any such distribution of net proceeds shall be made upon the terms of a cash distribution.



	Changes Affecting Ordinary Shares



	If
	there is any change in nominal or par value, split-up, cancellation, consolidation or any other reclassification of deposited securities, or upon any recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation or sale of assets affecting us or to
	which we are a party, any securities which shall be received by the depositary in exchange for, or in conversion of or replacement of or otherwise in respect of, such deposited securities shall, to the extent permitted by law, be treated as new
	deposited securities, and the ADRs shall, subject to the provisions of the deposit agreement and applicable law, evidence ADSs representing the right to receive such additional securities. The depositary may, with our approval, and shall, if we so
	request, subject to receipt of an opinion of our counsel satisfactory to the depositary, that such distributions are not in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, execute and deliver additional ADRs as in the case of a share dividend on
	the Ordinary Shares, or call for the surrender of outstanding ADRs to be exchanged for new ADRs. In the event that any security so received may not be lawfully distributed to some or all ADS holders, the depositary may, with our approval, and shall,
	if we request, subject to receipt of an opinion of our counsel satisfactory to the depositary that such action is not in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, sell such securities at public or private sale, at such place or places and
	upon such terms as it may deem proper, and may allocate the net proceeds of such sales, net of fees and charges of, and expenses incurred by, the depositary and taxes, for the account of the ADS holders. The net proceeds may be allocated to ADS
	holders entitled to receive such securities on an averaged or other practical basis and distributed to ADS holders to the extent practicable.


	The depositary shall not be responsible for any failure to determine that it may be lawful or feasible to make such securities available to
	ADS holders in general or to any ADS holder in particular, any foreign exchange exposure or loss incurred in connection with such sale or any liability to the purchaser of such securities.



	Redemption



	The Company has a right to
	redeem any of the deposited securities. The depositary will provide a notice of redemption rights to the ADS holders only upon 30 days prior notice being given by the Company with satisfactory documentation and the depositary has determined
	that the redemption is practicable. Upon receipt of the applicable redemption price, the depositary will retire the ADSs delivered by ADS holders and distribute the net proceeds. If less than all outstanding deposited securities are redeemed, the
	ADSs to be retired will be selected by lot or on a pro rata basis, as may be determined by the depositary.



	Issuance of ADSs Upon Deposit of Ordinary
	Shares



	Upon each deposit of shares and compliance with the other provisions of the deposit agreement, including the payment of the
	charges of the depositary and any taxes and governmental fees and charges owing, the depositary will issue the ADSs representing the Ordinary Shares deposited and will execute and deliver at its principal New York office an ADR or ADRs in the name
	of the person entitled thereto evidencing the number of ADSs to which the person is entitled. The depositary shall only issue ADSs in whole numbers.



	Transfer, Combination and Split Up of ADRs



	Where there is a transfer, combination or spilt up of ADRs, the depositary will cancel the ADRs, execute new ADRs evidencing the same aggregate
	number of ADSs as those evidenced by the ADRs cancelled and deliver such new ADRs to the ADS holders, provided that:


	 




	 


	


	 


	the ADRs have been duly delivered by the ADS holder to the depositary;




	 


	-22-







	Table of Contents





	 


	


	 


	in the case of a transfer, the surrendered ADRs have been properly endorsed or are accompanied by proper instruments of transfer;




	 




	 


	


	 


	the surrendered ADRs have been duly stamped if required by applicable law; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	all applicable fees and charges of, and expenses incurred by, the depositary and all applicable taxes and governmental charges have been paid.





	Withdrawal of Shares Upon Cancellation of ADSs



	When ADS holders surrender their ADSs to withdraw the deposited securities, the depositary will, upon payment of applicable fees, charges and
	expenses and upon receipt of proper instructions, cancel the ADSs surrendered to it and deliver the underlying shares in accordance with the ADS holders instructions.


	If the deposited securities include shares that have not been dematerialized and listed for trading on the BSE and the NSE, the shares
	withdrawn will be selected first from the shares that have been dematerialized and listed for trading on the BSE and the NSE and thereafter from the shares that have not been so dematerialized and listed. None of the custodian, the depositary or the
	Company will have any liability to any holder or beneficial owner of ADSs who receives, upon cancellation of ADSs, any shares that have not been dematerialized and listed for trading on the BSE and the NSE.


	ADS holders are entitled to surrender outstanding ADSs to withdraw the deposited securities at any time subject only to:


	 




	 


	


	 


	temporary delays caused by closing the transfer books of our company or the depositary or the deposit of shares in connection with voting at a shareholders meeting or the payment of dividends;




	 




	 


	


	 


	payment of fees, taxes and similar charges;




	 




	 


	


	 


	compliance with any laws or governmental regulations relating to the ADRs or to the withdrawal of the deposited securities; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	other circumstances specifically contemplated by Instruction I.A.(1) of the General Instructions to Form F-6 (as the same may be amended from time to time).





	Voting Rights



	ADS holders may not attend
	or directly exercise voting rights in shareholders meetings but ADS holders may instruct the depositary how to exercise the voting rights for the shares which underlie the ADSs. Each ADS represents five Ordinary Shares. After receiving voting
	materials from us, if requested by our company at least 21 days prior to the date of the vote or meeting, the depositary will notify the ADS holders of any shareholders meeting or solicitation of consents or proxies and a statement that
	describes how the ADS holders may instruct the depositary to exercise the voting rights for the shares that underlie their ADSs. In lieu of distributing the notice and materials, the depositary may, to the extent not prohibited by law or
	regulations, provide ADS holders with instructions on how the information can be retrieved or received for example, by reference to a website or a contact.


	The depositary may require voting instructions to be submitted to the depositary as early as five business days before the date of meeting to
	be valid. Voting instructions may be given only in respect of a number of ADSs representing an integral number of deposited securities.


	The depositary will endeavor, insofar as practicable and subject to the applicable law and Indian practice and provisions of the deposit
	agreement, our Articles of Association and the deposited securities, to vote or to have its agents vote the deposited securities as instructed. The depositary will not itself exercise any voting discretion. If the depositary receives valid voting
	instructions from a holder who fails to specify the manner in


	 


	-23-







	Table of Contents



	which the depositary is to vote the deposited securities represented by the ADSs, the depositary will deem such holder to have instructed the depositary to vote in favor of the items set forth in
	the voting instructions. If we requested the depositary to solicit instructions and the depositary does not receive voting instructions from a ADS holder by the required date, the ADS holder is deemed to have authorized and instructed it to give a
	discretionary proxy to a person designated by us to vote, unless we inform the depositary that:


	 




	 


	


	 


	we do not wish such discretionary proxy given;




	 




	 


	


	 


	substantial opposition exists; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	the rights of ADS holders will be adversely affected.




	The depositary and its agents shall not
	be liable for any failure to carry out any instructions to vote any of the deposited securities, or for the manner in which any vote is cast or the effect of any vote, provided that any such action or omission is in good faith and in accordance with
	the terms of the deposit agreement.


	There can be no assurance that ADS holders will receive voting materials in time to instruct the
	depositary to vote and it is possible that ADS holders, or persons who hold their ADSs through brokers, dealers or other third parties, will not have the opportunity to exercise a right to vote.



	ADS Record Dates



	The depositary may fix
	record dates for the determination of the ADS holders who will be entitled:


	 




	 


	


	 


	to receive a distribution;




	 




	 


	


	 


	to give instructions for the exercise of voting rights at a meeting of holders of Ordinary Shares or other deposited securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	to give or withhold consent solicited by us;




	 




	 


	


	 


	to receive notice of meeting or solicitation of consent or proxies; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	to exercise the rights of ADS holders with respect to changed number of shares represented by each ADS;




	all subject to the provisions of the deposit agreement.



	Reports and Other Communications



	The
	depositary will make available for inspection by ADS holders any written reports or communications from us (including proxy soliciting materials) which are both received by the depositary, the custodian or their respective nominee as the holder of
	the deposited securities and made generally available to the holders of Ordinary Shares or other securities of the same class as those constituting deposited securities.


	In addition, if we make any other written communications generally available to holders of Ordinary Shares or other securities of the same
	class as those constituting deposited securities, it will provide an English version to the depositary. The depositary will make such communications available to inspection by ADS holders and at our request and expense provide copies thereof to all
	ADS holders or make such communications available to them on a basis similar to that for holders of Ordinary Shares or other securities of the same class as those constituting deposited securities or on such other basis as we may advise according to
	applicable laws, rules and regulations.

	


	 


	such fees and expenses as are incurred by the depositary in connection with compliance with exchange control regulations and other regulatory requirements applicable to shares, deposited securities, ADSs and ADRs; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	the fees and expenses incurred by the depositary, the custodian or any nominee in connection with the servicing or delivery of deposited securities.




	The fees and charges an ADS holder may be required to pay may vary over time and may be changed by us and by the depositary. ADS holders will
	receive prior notice of increases in such fees and charges.



	Payment of taxes



	ADS holders and beneficial owners must pay any tax or other governmental charge payable by the custodian or by the depositary with respect to
	any ADR, deposited securities or ADSs. If an ADS holder or a beneficial owner owes any tax or other governmental charge, the depositary may (i) deduct the amount thereof from any distributions made in respect of deposited securities or
	(ii) sell deposited securities and deduct the amount owing from the net proceeds of the sale. In either case, the ADS holder and the beneficial owner remain liable for any deficiency. In addition, the depositary may also refuse to issue,
	deliver, register the ADSs or withdraw deposited securities until full payment of the tax or charges owed is received. If any tax or governmental charge is required to be withheld on any non-cash distribution, the depositary may sell the distributed
	property to pay the taxes and distribute any remaining net proceeds to the ADS holders entitled thereto.


	ADS holders and beneficial
	owners agree to indemnify the depositary, us, the custodian, and any of their agents, officers, employees and affiliates for, and to hold each of them harmless from any claims and penalties with respect to taxes arising from any tax benefit obtained
	by such holder and/or beneficial owner.

	Amendment and Supplementation



	We may agree with the depositary to amend or supplement the deposit agreement and the ADRs without consent of ADS holders for any reason which
	we and the depositary may deem necessary or desirable. Any amendment or supplement that imposes or increases any fees or charges (other than charges in connection with foreign exchange control regulations, and taxes and other governmental charges,
	delivery and other such expenses), or that shall otherwise materially prejudice any substantial existing right of ADS holders shall only be effective upon 30 days notice being given to the ADS holders. If an ADS holder continues to hold an ADS
	or ADSs after being so notified, the ADS holder is deemed to agree to the amendment or supplement.


	No amendment or supplement will impair
	the right of the ADS holders to surrender their ADSs and receive the underlying securities except to the extent necessary to comply with mandatory provisions of applicable law. If a governmental body adopts new laws, rules or regulations which
	require the deposit agreement to be amended or supplemented, we and the depositary may make the necessary amendments or supplements, which may become effective before notice is given to ADS holders.



	Termination



	The depositary shall, at our
	direction, terminate the deposit agreement by giving the ADS holders at least 30 days prior notice. The depositary may also terminate the deposit agreement by giving notice of termination to the ADS holders at least 30 days prior to the date
	fixed for such termination if (i) at least 30 days have passed since the depositary delivered to us a written notice of its election to resign or (ii) at least 90 days have passed since we delivered to the depositary a written notice of
	removal of the depositary, and in either case a successor depositary has not been appointed and accepted its appointment. After termination, the depositarys only responsibility will be (i) to deliver deposited securities (together with
	any dividends and other distributions or proceeds therefrom) to ADS holders who surrender their ADSs and (ii) to hold or sell distributions received on deposited securities. After the expiration of six months from the termination date, the
	depositary may sell the deposited securities that remain and hold the net proceeds of the sales, unsegregated and without liability for interest, for the pro rata benefit of the ADS holders who have not yet surrendered their ADSs. After making the
	sale, the depositary shall have no obligations except to account for the net proceeds of such sale and other cash. The depositary will not be required to invest the proceeds or pay interest on them.



	Books of Depositary



	The depositary or
	its agent will maintain a register for the registration of issuance, registration of transfer, combination and split-up of ADSs. These records are open for inspection by ADS holders at all reasonable times, but solely for the purpose of
	communicating with other ADS holders in the interest of business matters relating to the deposit agreement.


	The depositary or its agent
	may close the transfer books at any time or from time to time, when deemed necessary or advisable by it in good faith in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder, or at our reasonable request.


	If any ADSs are listed on one or more stock exchanges or automated quotation systems in the United States, the depositary shall act as
	registrar or appoint a registrar or one or more co-registrars for registration of ADRs and transfers, combinations and split-ups, and to countersign the ADRs evidencing such ADSs (if applicable) in accordance with any requirements of such exchanges
	or systems. Such registrars or co-registrars may be removed and a substitute or substitutes appointed by the depositary.

	

	RESTRICTIONS REGARDING FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN INDIA




	General



	Prior to June 1, 2000,
	foreign investment in Indian securities, including the acquisition, sale and transfer of securities of Indian companies, was regulated by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 and the notifications issued by the Reserve Bank of India, or RBI,
	thereunder.


	With effect from June 1, 2000, foreign investment in Indian securities is regulated by the Foreign Exchange Management
	Act 1999, as amended from time to time, or FEMA, and the rules, regulations and notifications made under FEMA. A person resident outside India can transfer any security of an Indian company or any other security to an Indian resident only under the
	terms and conditions specified in FEMA and the rules and regulations made thereunder or as permitted by the RBI.


	The RBI issued the
	Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident Outside India) Regulations 2000, or the Foreign Exchange Regulations, to regulate the issue of Indian securities including ADSs to persons resident outside India and the
	transfer of Indian securities by or to persons resident outside India. The Foreign Exchange Regulations provide that an Indian entity may issue securities to a person resident outside India or record in its books any transfer of security from or to
	such person only in the manner set forth in FEMA and the rules and regulations made thereunder or as permitted by the RBI.



	Foreign Direct Investment



	The Government of India, pursuant to its liberalization policy, set up the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, or FIPB, to regulate
	all foreign direct investment into India. Foreign Direct Investment, or FDI, means investment by way of subscription and/or purchase of securities of an Indian company by a non-resident investor. Regulatory approval is required for investment in
	some sectors, including housing, petroleum (other than refining), defense and strategic industries. Also, the following investments would require prior regulatory permission:


	 




	 


	


	 


	foreign investments, including a transfer of shares, in excess of foreign investment limits;




	 




	 


	


	 


	investments by an unincorporated entity;




	 




	 


	


	 


	investment in industries for which industrial licensing is compulsory; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	all proposals relating to transfer of control and/or ownership pursuant to amalgamation, merger or acquisition of an Indian company currently owned or controlled by resident Indian citizens and Indian companies, which
	are owned or controlled by resident Indian citizens to a non-resident entity, the activities of which company are not under the automatic route under existing Indian foreign investment policy.




	Subject to certain exceptions, FDI and investment by non-resident Indians in Indian companies do not require the prior approval of the FIPB or
	the RBI. The Government of India has indicated that in all cases where FDI is allowed on an automatic basis without FIPB approval, the RBI would continue to be the primary agency for the purposes of monitoring and regulating foreign investment. In
	cases where FIPB approval is obtained, no approval of the RBI is required. In both cases, the prescribed applicable norms with respect to determining the price at which the shares may be issued by the Indian company to the non-resident investor
	would need to be complied with and a declaration in the prescribed form, detailing the foreign investment, must be filed with the RBI once the foreign investment is made in the Indian company. The foregoing description applies only to an issuance of
	shares by, and not to a transfer of shares of, Indian companies.



	Pricing



	Under the requirements of the Consolidated FDI Policy of 2014, or the FDI Policy, the price of shares of a listed Indian company issued to
	non-residents on an automatic basis cannot be less than the price worked out in accordance with the guidelines issued by the SEBI for the preferential allotment of shares where the shares of such company are listed.


	 


	-30-







	Table of Contents



	Every Indian company issuing shares or convertible debentures in accordance with the Foreign
	Exchange Regulations is required to submit a report to the RBI within 30 days of receipt of the consideration and another report within 30 days from the date of issue of the shares to the non-resident purchaser.


	The above description applies only to a primary issue of shares or convertible debentures by an Indian company.



	Portfolio Investment by Foreign Portfolio Investors



	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Foreign Portfolio Investors) Regulations, 2014, or the FPI Regulations, have replaced the
	Securities and Exchange Board of India (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations and the regime for investments by qualified institutional investors.


	The FPI Regulations came into effect on June 1, 2014. Under the FPI Regulations, a Foreign Institutional Investor, or FII, who holds a
	valid certificate of registration from SEBI shall be deemed to be a registered Foreign Portfolio Investor, or FPI until the expiry of the block of three years for which fees have been paid as per the FII Regulations. An FII shall not be eligible to
	invest as an FII after registering as an FPI under the FPI Regulations.


	FPIs who are registered with the SEBI are required to comply with
	the provisions of the FPI Regulations. A registered FPI may buy, subject to the ownership restrictions discussed below, and sell freely securities issued by any Indian company, realize capital gains on investments made through the initial
	amount invested in India, subscribe to or renounce rights offerings for shares, appoint a domestic custodian for custody of investments made and repatriate the capital, capital gains, dividends, income received by way of interest and any
	compensation received towards sale or renunciation of rights offerings of shares. An FPI may not hold more than 10% of the total issued capital of a company in its own name. The total holding of all FPIs in a company is subject to a cap of 24% of
	the total paid-up capital of a company, which can be increased to the relevant industry sector cap/ceiling applicable to the particular company under the Foreign Direct Investment Regime, with the passing of a special resolution by the shareholders
	of a company in a general meeting and subject to prior intimation to the RBI. Pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors and special resolutions passed by our shareholders, the FII and FPI limits have been increased to 35% of the paid-up
	capital of Ordinary Shares and 75% of the paid-up capital of A Ordinary Shares.


	FPIs are permitted to purchase shares and
	convertible debentures, subject to limits, of an Indian company either through:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a public offer, where the price of the shares to be issued is not less than the price at which the shares are issued to Indian residents, or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a private placement, where the price of the shares to be issued is not less than the price according to the terms of the relevant guidelines or the guidelines issued by the former Controller of Capital Issues.




	The FPI Regulations specify that the shares purchased by a single FPI or an investor group (which means the same set of
	ultimate beneficial person(s) investing through multiple entities) must be below 10% of the issued capital of a company. All existing investments by FIIs, qualified foreign investors, which are persons who have opened a dematerialized account with a
	qualified depository participant as a qualified foreign investor and sub-accounts thereof are grandfathered, thus, if an FPI already holds 10% of the issued capital of a company, it is not required to divest its existing holdings to comply with the
	stipulation to hold below 10%.


	Under the FPI Regulations, Offshore Derivative Instruments, or ODIs, may be issued to only
	those entities that are regulated by an appropriate foreign regulatory authority. Furthermore, such ODIs may only be issued after compliance with applicable know-your-client norms. However, entities that are themselves unregulated but managed by a
	regulated entity will be eligible counterparties for ODIs under the FPI Regulations if such entities

	Table of Contents



	(i) have previously entered into an ODI with an FII at any time prior to January 7, 2014, and (ii) are registered as a client of the FII. Hence, all outstanding ODI transactions
	and counterparties under the FII Regulations will be treated as permitted ODI transactions and counterparties under the FPI Regulations. SEBI issued a circular on November 24, 2014 aligning the applicable eligibility and investment norms
	between the FPI regime and subscription through the ODI regime. An FPI shall issue ODIs only to those subscribers who: (i) meet the eligibility criteria that are applicable to an FPI under the FPI Regulations and (ii) do not have
	opaque structures, as defined under the FPI Regulations. The investment restrictions applicable to FPIs under the FPI Regulations apply to subscribers of ODIs as well. Existing ODI positions which are not in accordance with the SEBI
	circular dated November 24, 2014 may continue until the ODI contract expires.


	Investors in ADSs do not need to seek the specific
	approval from the Government of India to purchase, hold or dispose of their ADSs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an FII, non-resident Indian or overseas corporate body were to withdraw its equity shares from an ADS program, its investment in the
	equity shares would be subject to the general restrictions on foreign ownership.


	Registered FIIs are generally subject to tax under
	Section 115AD of the Income Tax Act of 1961. There is uncertainty under Indian law as to the tax regime applicable to FIIs that hold and trade in ADSs and Shares. See TaxationTaxation of Capital Gains and LossesIndian
	Taxation.



	Portfolio Investment by Non-Resident Indians



	A variety of methods for investing in shares of Indian companies are available to non-resident Indians. These methods allow non-resident
	Indians to make portfolio investments in shares and other securities of Indian companies on a basis not generally available to other foreign investors. In addition to portfolio investments in Indian companies, non-resident Indians may also make
	foreign direct investments in Indian companies pursuant to the FDI. See Foreign Direct Investment.



	Transfer of Shares and
	Convertible Debentures of an Indian Company by a Person Resident Outside India



	The Government of India has granted general permission
	to persons residing outside India to transfer shares and convertible debentures held by them to an Indian resident, subject to compliance with certain terms and conditions and reporting requirements. A resident who wishes to purchase shares from a
	non-resident must, pursuant to the relevant notice requirements, file a declaration with an authorized dealer in the prescribed Form FC-TRS, together with the relevant documents and file an acknowledgment thereof with the Indian company to effect
	transfer of the shares to his name.


	Moreover, the transfer of shares between an Indian resident and a non-resident (other than a
	non-resident Indian, or NRI) does not require the prior approval of the Government of India or RBI, provided that (i) the activities of the investee company are under the automatic route pursuant to the FDI Policy, and the transfer is not
	subject to regulations under the Takeover Code (ii) the non-resident shareholding complies with sector limits under the FDI Policy and (iii) the pricing is in accordance with the guidelines prescribed by the SEBI and RBI.



	Indirect Foreign Investment



	The FDI
	Policy, among other things, prescribes the guidelines for (i) the calculation of total indirect foreign investment in Indian companies, (ii) transfer of ownership or control of Indian companies in sectors with caps from resident Indian
	citizens to non-resident entities and (iii) guidelines on downstream investments by Indian companies. Pursuant to the Consolidated FDI Policy, for the purposes of computation of indirect foreign investment in an Indian company, foreign
	investments in its parent company, by FPI (holding as of March 31 of the relevant year), NRIs, ADSs, global depositary shares, foreign currency convertible bonds, FDI, convertible preference shares and convertible currency debentures are
	required to be taken together. The FDI Policy is reissued annually.

	Issue of Securities Through the Depository Receipt Mechanism



	Issue of securities through the depository receipt mechanism by Indian companies is governed by the Companies Act, 2013, the Companies (Issue
	of Global Depository Receipts) Rules, 2014 and the Depository Receipts Scheme, 2014, or the DR Scheme.


	The Government of India notified
	the DR Scheme on October 21, 2014, which came into force on December 15, 2014. Consequently, the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares (Through Depository Receipt Mechanism) Scheme, 1993, or the 1993 Scheme has
	been repealed except to the extent relating to foreign currency convertible bonds. The RBI has issued a circular on December 15, 2014 amending the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or Issue of Security by a Person Resident outside India)
	Regulations, 2000 to bring it in line with the DR Scheme. The RBI also issued a circular on January 22, 2015 highlighting the salient features of the DR Scheme.


	Under the DR Scheme, an Indian company, listed or unlisted, private or public, is permitted to issue securities, including equity shares,
	through the depository receipt mechanism if such company has not been specifically prohibited from accessing capital markets or dealing in securities. Permissible securities that may be issued by an Indian company through the depository receipt
	mechanism are securities as defined under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, which includes, among other things, shares, bonds, derivatives, units of mutual funds and similar instruments issued by private companies,
	provided that such securities are in dematerialized form.


	An Indian company may issue securities to a foreign depository for the purpose
	of issuing depository receipts through any mode permissible for the issue of such securities to other investors. The foreign depository may issue depository receipts by way of a public offering or private placement or in any other manner prevalent
	in the permissible jurisdiction. A permissible jurisdiction is defined as a foreign jurisdiction which is a member of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering and whose securities regulator is a member of the International
	Organization of Securities Commissions.


	Under the DR Scheme, securities may be issued through the depository receipt mechanism up to such
	a limit that the aggregate underlying securities issued to foreign depositories for issuance of depository receipts along with securities already held by persons resident outside India does not exceed the applicable foreign investment limits
	prescribed by regulations framed under the FEMA. The depository receipts and the underlying securities may be converted into each other subject to the applicable foreign investment limit. For our company, there is no investment limit.


	Under the 1993 Scheme, the pricing of deposit receipts for listed companies could not have been less than the average of the weekly high and
	low closing prices of the related shares quoted on the relevant stock exchange during the two weeks preceding the relevant date. However, the DR Scheme provides that underlying securities shall not be issued to a foreign depository for issuance of
	depository receipts at a price which is less than the price applicable to a corresponding mode of issuance to domestic investors.


	In
	terms of the DR Scheme, the foreign depository is entitled to exercise voting rights, if any, associated with the underlying securities whether pursuant to voting instructions from the holder of depository receipts or otherwise. Furthermore, a
	holder of depository receipts issued against underlying equity shares shall have the same obligations as if it is the holder of the equity shares if it has the right to issue voting instruction.

	DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND POLICY




	Dividend Policy



	Any dividend declared by
	our company is based on the profits available for distribution as reported in the unconsolidated statutory financial statements of TML India prepared in accordance with Indian GAAP. In addition, Indian law mandates that dividends be declared out of
	distributable profits only after the transfer of the portion of its profit for that fiscal year as TML India may consider appropriate to the reserves of the company. Based on the net income available for appropriation, dividends are recommended by
	the Board of Directors for approval by the shareholders at our annual general meeting. Furthermore, the Board of Directors may also pay an interim dividend at its discretion.


	Since Fiscal 1956, we have had an uninterrupted dividend distribution except for Fiscal 2001 and 2002. Considering our financial performance,
	we declared dividends (excluding dividend tax) totaling Rs.6,485 million, Rs.12,807 million and Rs.12,742 million in Fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012.


	Our cash is located at various of our subsidiaries. There may be legal, contractual or economic restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to
	transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances. Brazil, Russia, South Africa and other locations have regulatory restrictions, disincentives or costs on pooling or transferring of cash. However, such restrictions have not had
	and are not estimated to have significant impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations.


	Certain debt issued at Jaguar Land Rover is
	subject to customary covenants and events of default which include, among other things, restrictions or limitations on the amount of cash which may be transferred outside the Jaguar Land Rover group of companies in the form of dividends, loans or
	investments. These are referred to as restricted payments in the relevant financing documentation. In general, the amount of cash which may be transferred outside the Jaguar Land Rover group is limited to 50% of its cumulative
	consolidated net income (as defined in the relevant documentation) from January 2011. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated amount that was available for dividend payments, other distributions and restricted payments outside the Jaguar Land
	Rover group of companies is approximately GBP2,319 million.

	The table below sets forth, for each of the fiscal years indicated, the per share amounts of dividends distributed by our company with respect

	TAXATION



	This section describes the material Indian stamp duty and income and service tax consequences to

	non-residents

	(as defined below) and the U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. holders (as defined below) of owning the Shares or ADSs and the material Indian tax consequences to
	non-residents of India (as defined below) of receiving, owning, and disposing of rights to acquire Shares or ADSs. This section does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences of receiving, owning and disposing of rights to
	subscribe for Shares and ADSs. Such U.S. federal income tax consequences will be addressed in the applicable prospectus supplement. This section applies to you only if you hold your Shares, ADSs or rights to acquire Shares or ADSs as capital assets
	for tax purposes. This section does not apply to you if you are a member of a special class of holders subject to special rules, including:


	 




	 


	


	 


	a dealer in securities;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a tax-exempt organization;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a life insurance company;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a person liable for alternative minimum tax;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a person that actually or constructively owns 10% or more of our voting stock;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a person that holds Shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a person that purchases or sells Shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for tax purposes; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a U.S. holder whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.




	With regard to U.S. tax, the
	following discussion addresses only the material U.S. federal income tax consequences for persons that are U.S. holders. You are a U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of the Shares or ADSs and you are, for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes:


	 




	 


	


	 


	an individual citizen or resident of the United States;




	 




	 


	


	 


	a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of Colombia,




	 




	 


	


	 


	an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income tax regardless of its source; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	a trust if (i) a U.S. court can exercise primary supervision over the trusts administration and one or more U.S. persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) it has a
	valid election in effect under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.




	With regard to Indian tax,
	the following discussion addresses only the tax consequences for persons that are non-residents of India, as defined in the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 as proposed by the Finance Bill of 2015 (the Income Tax Act) and is
	based on the provisions of Section 115AC and other applicable provisions of the Income Tax Act and the Depository Receipts Scheme, 2014, or the 2014 Scheme, which has replaced the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares
	(Through Depository Receipt Mechanism) Scheme, 1993 promulgated by the Government of India. However, unlike the 1993 Scheme, the 2014 Scheme does not contain specific provisions related to certain aspects of taxation in India of income earned
	from ADSs, such as the cost of acquisition and period of holding of shares after conversion of ADSs.


	For purposes of the Income Tax Act,
	non-resident means a person who is not a resident of India. An individual is a resident of India during any fiscal year, if such person (i) is in India in that year for 182 days or more or (ii) was in India for 365 days or more during
	the four preceding years and is in India for 60 days or more in that year. A company is resident in India in any fiscal year if it is an Indian company or the control and management of its affairs is situated wholly in India in that year. A firm or
	other association of persons is resident in India except where the control and the management of its affairs are situated wholly outside India. As per the Finance Bill 2015, a company is said to be resident in India in any fiscal year if it is an
	Indian company or

	its place of effective management, at any time in that year, is in India. Place of effective management means a place where key management and commercial decisions that
	are necessary for the conduct of the business of an entity as a whole are, in substance made.


	With regard to U.S. federal income tax, the
	following discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, administrative pronouncements, judicial decisions and final, temporary and proposed Treasury Regulations, all as of the date hereof, changes to any of which may affect
	the tax consequences described herein, possibly with retroactive effect.


	If an entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes holds Shares or ADSs, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you hold Shares or ADSs as a partner in a partnership, you should
	consult your tax advisor with regard to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in our Shares or ADSs.


	This discussion
	addresses only U.S. federal income taxation and Indian stamp duty and income and service taxation. In addition, this section is based in part upon the representations of the depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the deposit agreement
	and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.


	This summary is not intended to constitute a complete analysis
	of the individual tax consequences for a non-resident of India for the acquisition, ownership and sale of ADSs, Shares and right to acquire ADSs or Shares.


	The Indian tax implications set out below are subject to the changes proposed in the Finance Bill, 2015, which has recently been introduced
	and has not yet received approval from the Indian Parliament.


	In the descriptions below relating to Indian taxation, references to
	you are to a person resident outside India, subscribing to ADSs.



	Taxation of Dividends





	Indian Taxation




	Dividends paid to
	you will not be subject to Indian tax. However, we have to pay a dividend distribution tax currently at the effective tax rate of 19.995% (inclusive of applicable surcharge and cess) on the amount of dividend paid out. The Finance Bill,
	2015, proposes to increase the surcharge from 10% to 12%. As a result, the revised effective tax applicable to distributions of dividends would become 20.36%.


	If you are a non-resident of India, the distributions made to you of additional ADSs or Shares or rights to subscribe for Shares and ADSs with
	respect to ADSs or Shares should not be subject to Indian tax.




	U.S. Federal Income Taxation




	Under the U.S. federal income tax laws, and subject to the Passive Foreign Investment Company, or PFIC, rules described below, if you are a
	U.S. holder, the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) with respect to Shares or ADSs is subject to U.S. federal income taxation. If you are a
	non-corporate U.S. holder, dividends that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to you at the preferential rates applicable to long-term capital gains provided that you hold the Shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 121-day
	period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet other holding period requirements. Dividends we pay with respect to Shares or ADSs will generally be qualified dividend income.


	The dividend is taxable to you when you, in the case of Shares, or the depositary, in the case of ADSs, receive the dividend, actually or
	constructively. The dividend will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to U.S. corporations in respect of dividends received from other U.S. corporations. The amount of the dividend distribution that you must
	include in your income as a U.S. holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the Indian rupee payments made, determined at the spot Indian rupee/U.S. dollar rate on the


	 


	-37-







	Table of Contents



	date the dividend distribution is includible in your income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange
	fluctuations during the period from the date you include the dividend payment in your income to the date you convert the payment into U.S. dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate
	applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as
	determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain. However, we do not expect to calculate earnings and profits in
	accordance with U.S. federal income tax principles. Accordingly, you should expect to generally treat distributions we make as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes.


	Dividends that we pay with respect to Shares and ADSs will generally be income from sources outside the United States and will, depending on
	your circumstances, be either passive or general income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit limitation allowable to you.



	Indian Taxation of Rights



	Issuance to a
	non-resident of India of rights to acquire Shares or ADSs is not subject to tax in the hands of the non-resident of India. Exercise of the rights to acquire Shares or ADSs by a non-resident of India of such rights is not subject to any Indian tax
	consequences. Further, there are no Indian tax consequences (including Indian stamp duty and Indian service tax consequences) to a non-resident of India upon the lapse of rights to acquire Shares or ADSs.


	It is unclear as to whether capital gain derived from the sale of rights to acquire Shares and ADSs by a non-resident of India that is not
	entitled to exemption under a tax treaty to another non-resident of India outside India will be subject to Indian capital gains tax. If rights to acquire Shares and ADSs are deemed by the Indian tax authorities to be situated within India,
	considering situs is in India, the gains realized on the sale of rights will be subject to Indian taxation. These rights would generally be in the nature of short-term capital assets and would therefore be subject to Indian tax at variable rates
	with the maximum rate of 40% plus applicable rate of surcharge on income tax and cess at the applicable rate. The actual rate of tax on short-term capital gains depends on a number of factors, including the legal status of the non-resident of India
	and the type of income chargeable in India. Tax on capital gains would be deducted at source by the purchaser of rights to acquire Shares and ADSs in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act. For determining such capital gains
	derived from the sale of rights, the cost of acquisition of the rights to acquire Shares and ADSs shall be nil, i.e. $0.



	Taxation of Capital Gains and
	Losses







	Indian Taxation







	Capital Gains

	: If you are a non-resident of India, any gain realized by you on the sale of ADSs to another non-resident will not be
	subject to Indian capital gains tax under Section 115AC and other applicable provisions of the Income Tax Act. However, it is unclear whether a capital gain realized by you on the sale of rights to subscribe for Share or ADSs to a non-resident
	may be subject to Indian capital gains tax.


	Capital gains realized by you on the transfer of Shares (including Shares received in
	exchange of the ADSs), whether in India or outside India, to a non-resident of India or Indian resident, will be liable for income tax under the provisions of the Income Tax Act.


	Shares (including Shares issuable on the exchange of the ADSs) held by you for a period of more than 12 months will be treated as long-term
	capital assets and the capital gains arising on the sale thereof will be treated as long-term capital gains. If the Shares are held by you for a period of 12 months or less, such Shares will be treated as short-term capital assets and the capital
	gains arising on the sale thereof are treated as short-term capital gains.


	 


	-38-







	Table of Contents



	There is no specific provision in the Indian Income Tax Act pertaining to the determination of
	the cost of acquisition of Shares (including Shares issuable on the exchange of ADSs). Under the 1993 Scheme for the purpose of computing capital gains tax on the sale of the Shares, the cost of acquisition of Shares received in exchange for ADSs
	will be determined on the basis of the prevailing price of the Shares on the Indian stock exchanges as on the date on which the relevant depository gives notice to its custodian for the delivery of such Shares upon redemption of the ADSs.


	Under the 1993 Scheme, the holding period (for purposes of determining the applicable Indian capital gains tax rate) in respect of Shares
	received in exchange for ADSs commences on the date of the advice of withdrawal of such Shares by the relevant depository to its custodian.


	Gain realized by you on the sale of listed Shares held for more than 12 months will not be subject to Indian capital gains tax if the
	Securities Transaction Tax, or STT, has been paid on the transaction. The STT will be levied on and collected by an Indian stock exchange on which the Shares are sold at the rate of 0.025% to 0.1% depending upon the nature of the transaction. Gain
	realized on the sale of rights to acquire Shares or ADSs is not subject to any STT.


	For the purpose of computing capital gains on the
	sale of the Shares or ADSs received upon exercise of right to acquire the Shares or ADSs, the cost of acquisition of such Shares or ADS shall be the price paid for acquiring the Shares or ADSs. A non-resident of Indias holding period (for
	purposes of determining Indian capital gains tax rate) in respect of Shares or ADSs received upon exercise of the rights commences on the date of allotment of such Shares or ADSs.


	Any gain realized by you on the sale of listed Shares held for more than 12 months on which no STT has been paid will be subject to Indian
	capital gains tax at the rate of 10% plus applicable surcharge on income tax and education tax at the applicable rates.


	Capital gains
	realized in respect of Shares held by you (calculated in the manner set forth above) for 12 months or less (short-term capital gain) on which STT is paid in the manner and rates set forth above, is subject to tax at the rate of 15% plus
	applicable surcharge on income tax and an education tax at the applicable rate. In the event that you do not pay STT, short-term capital gain will be subject to tax at variable rates with the maximum rate of 40% plus applicable rate of surcharge on
	income tax and education tax at the applicable rate. The actual rate of tax on short-term capital gains depends on a number of factors, including your legal status and the type of income chargeable in India.


	Tax on capital gains is to be deducted at source by the person paying for the shares in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Income
	Tax Act.



	Capital Losses:

	Section 115AC does not address capital losses arising on a transfer of Shares. In general terms,
	losses arising from a transfer of a capital asset in India may only be set off against capital gains and not against any other income. A short-term capital loss may be set off against a capital gain, whether

	short-term

	or long-term. However, long-term capital loss may only be set off against long-term capital gain and not against short-term capital gain. To the extent that the losses are not absorbed in the year
	of transfer you may carry it forward for a period of eight assessment years immediately succeeding the assessment year for which the loss was first determined and may set it off against the capital gains assessable for such subsequent assessment
	years. In order to set off capital losses in this manner, you would be required to file appropriate and timely tax returns in India. The long-term capital loss arising on a sale of Shares in respect of which STT is paid may not be available for
	set-off against any capital gains.




	U.S. Federal Income Taxation




	Generally, subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, if you are a U.S. holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of your Shares or ADSs, you
	will recognize capital gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount that you realize and your tax basis, determined in U.S. dollars, in your Shares or ADSs. If you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, your
	capital gain is generally taxed at preferential rates where you have a holding period greater than one year in the applicable Shares or ADSs at the time of the


	 


	-39-







	Table of Contents



	sale or other disposition. If you are a U.S. holder, certain limitations exist on your ability to deduct capital losses for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Your gain or loss from the
	disposition or other sale of Shares or ADSs generally will be income or loss from sources within the United States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.


	As discussed under Taxation of Capital Gains and LossesIndian Taxation, above, if you are a U.S. holder, capital gains
	that you realize upon a sale or other disposition of Shares or ADSs may be subject to tax in India. If you are a U.S. holder, you may be entitled to a foreign tax credit under the U.S. federal income tax laws for Indian taxes paid upon a sale or
	other disposition of Shares or ADSs. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit in respect of any such taxes imposed.



	Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules



	A non-U.S. corporation will be classified as a PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, if either (i) at least 75%
	of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of passive income or (ii) at least 50% of the value of its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year is attributable to assets that produce
	or are held for the production of passive income. Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rent, annuities, and net gains from the sale or exchange of certain property. For purposes of these tests, we will be treated as
	owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, more than 25% (by value) of the stock.


	We believe that your Shares and ADSs should not be treated as stock of a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but this conclusion is a
	factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change. If we were to be treated as a PFIC, then unless you elect to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to your Shares or ADSs, gain realized on the sale or
	other disposition of Shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as capital gain. Instead, if you are a U.S. holder, you would be treated as if you had realized such gain and certain excess distributions ratably over your holding
	period for Shares or ADSs, and you would be taxed at the highest U.S. federal income tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, together with an interest charged in respect of the tax attributable to each such year. With
	certain exceptions, your Shares or ADSs will be treated as stock in a PFIC if we were a PFIC at any time during your holding period in your Shares or ADSs. Dividends that you receive from us will not be eligible for the special tax rates applicable
	to qualified dividend income if we are treated as a PFIC with respect to you either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead will be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income.



	Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets



	If you are non-corporate U.S. holder that owns specified foreign financial assets with an aggregate value in excess of US$50,000
	(and in some circumstances, a higher threshold) you may be required to file an information report with respect to such assets with your U.S. federal income tax return. Specified foreign financial assets may include financial accounts
	maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as the following, but only if they are held for investment and not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (i) stocks and securities issued by non-U.S. persons,
	(ii) financial instruments and contracts that have non-U.S. issuers or counterparties, and (iii) interests in non-U.S. entities. Non-corporate U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of this
	reporting requirement to their ownership of the Shares or ADSs.



	Information Reporting and Backup Withholding



	If you are a non-corporate U.S. holder, information reporting requirements, on Internal Revenue Service Form 1099, generally will apply to
	dividend payments or other taxable distributions made to you within the United States, and the payment of proceeds to you from the sale of Shares or ADSs effected at a United States office of a broker.


	 


	-40-







	Table of Contents



	In addition, backup withholding may apply to such payments if you fail to comply with applicable
	certification requirements or you are notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on your U.S. federal income tax returns.


	Payment of the proceeds from the sale of Shares or ADSs effected at a foreign office of a broker generally will not be subject to information
	reporting or backup withholding. However, a sale effected at a foreign office of a broker could be subject to information reporting in the same manner as a sale within the United States (and in certain cases may be subject to backup withholding as
	well) if (i) the broker has certain connections to the United States, (ii) the proceeds or confirmation are sent to the United States or (iii) the sale has certain other specified connections with the United States.


	You generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by filing a
	refund claim with the Internal Revenue Service.



	Indian Tax Treaties



	The provisions of the tax treaty entered into by India and your country of residence will be applicable to the extent they are more beneficial
	to you. The Government of India has introduced provisions relating to General Anti Avoidance Rules, or GAAR, under which certain arrangements could be declared to be an impermissible avoidance arrangement. The consequences of such arrangements
	include denial of a tax benefit or a benefit under a tax treaty. The Finance Bill, 2015 proposes to make the GAAR provisions applicable from the Government of Indias fiscal year 2017. The Finance Minister in his speech has indicated that the
	investments made through March 31, 2017 will not be subject to GAAR. Also, the Government of India has introduced a provision by which you would not be entitled to claim any relief under the tax treaty unless a tax residency certificate is
	obtained by you from the government of the country of which you are a resident. Furthermore, you shall be required to provide such other required information, as has been publicly stated by the Government of India.


	Dividend income will not be subject to tax in India in your hands. If any Shares are held by you following withdrawal thereof from the
	depository bank under the deposit agreement, the provisions of a tax treaty, if any, entered into by India and the country of which you are a resident will be applicable to determine the taxation of any capital gain arising from a transfer of such
	shares.


	Under the 1993 Scheme, during the period of fiduciary ownership of Shares in the hands of the depository, the provisions of the
	tax treaty entered into by India and the country of residence of the depository will be applicable to determine the taxation of any capital gains in respect of ADSs.



	Indian Stamp Duty



	Under Indian law, any
	transfer of ADSs will be exempt from liability to Indian stamp duty. If you, being a purchaser of the Shares, seeks to register such Shares on the share register of the Company you will be required to pay Indian stamp duty at the rate of Rs.0.25 for
	every Rs.100 or part thereof of the market value of such Shares. In order to register a transfer of the Shares in physical form with the Company, you may be required to present a stamped deed of transfer. An acquisition of Shares in physical form
	from the depository in exchange for ADSs representing such Shares will not render you liable to Indian stamp duty but the Company will be required to pay stamp duty at the applicable rate on the share certificate. However, since our Shares are
	compulsorily deliverable in dematerialized form (except for trades of up to 500 shares which may be delivered in physical form), no stamp duty is payable on the acquisition or transfer of Shares in dematerialized form.



	Indian Service Tax



	Brokerage or
	commission fees paid to stockbrokers in India in connection with the sale or purchase of the Shares are subject to an Indian service tax of 12% (plus a 3% education tax). A stockbroker is responsible for collecting such service tax at such rate and
	for paying the same to the relevant authority. The Indian service tax rate, inclusive of applicable education tax, has been proposed to be increased to 14%, effective from the date to be notified. The Finance Bill, 2015 proposed to increase the
	applicable service tax rate to 14% with effect from a date to be notified shortly. Also, the new Swachh Bharat cess is proposed to be imposed on all taxable services at the rate of 2% on the value of such services.

	We may sell securities from time to time
	to one or more underwriters, who would purchase the securities as principal for resale to the public, either on a firm-commitment or best-efforts basis. If we sell securities to underwriters, we will execute an underwriting agreement with them at
	the time of sale and will name them in your prospectus supplement. If underwriters are used in the sale of securities offered through this prospectus, the underwriters will acquire the securities for their own account, including through
	underwriting, purchase, security lending or repurchase agreements with us and the names of the underwriters and the terms of the transaction will be set forth in the accompanying prospectus supplement, which will be used by the underwriters to make
	resales of the securities in respect of which this prospectus is delivered to the public. The underwriters may resell the securities from time to time in one or more transactions, including negotiated transactions. The underwriters may sell the
	securities in order to facilitate transactions in any of our other securities (described in this prospectus or otherwise), including other public or private transactions and short sales. The underwriters may offer the securities to the public either
	through underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or directly by one or more firms acting as underwriters. Unless otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus

	supplement, the obligations of the underwriters to purchase the securities will be subject to certain conditions, and the underwriters will be obligated to purchase all the offered securities if
	they purchase any of them. The underwriters may change from time to time any initial public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers.


	In connection with sales to underwriters, underwriters may be deemed to have received compensation from us in the form of underwriting
	discounts or commissions and may also receive commissions from purchasers of the securities for whom they may act as agents. Underwriters may resell the securities to or through dealers, and those dealers may receive compensation in the form of
	discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from purchasers for whom they may act as agents. The prospectus supplement will include information about any underwriting compensation we pay to underwriters, and any
	discounts, concessions or commissions underwriters allow to participating dealers, in connection with an offering of securities.


	If we
	offer securities in a subscription rights offering to our existing security holders, we may enter into a standby underwriting agreement with dealers, acting as standby underwriters. We may pay the standby underwriters a commitment fee for the
	securities they commit to purchase on a standby basis. If we do not enter into a standby underwriting arrangement, we may retain a dealer-manager to manage a subscription rights offering for us. Any rights offering by us will need to be in
	compliance with applicable Indian laws, rules and regulations. Equity shares (directly or in the form of ADSs), where the rights offering involves standby underwriters, subscribed by the standby underwriters may be resold by them by one or more of
	the methods described above.


	The underwriters, dealers and agents, as well as their associates, may be customers of or lenders to, and
	may engage in transactions with and perform services for, us and our subsidiaries and affiliates.


	Maximum compensation to any
	underwriters, dealers or agents will not exceed any applicable limitations set out by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.



	Delayed Delivery
	Contracts



	We may authorize underwriters, dealers and agents to solicit from third parties offers to purchase securities under
	contracts providing for the payment and delivery on future dates. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the material terms of these contracts, including any conditions to the purchasers obligations, and will include any required
	information about commissions we may pay for soliciting these contracts.



	Derivative Transactions and Hedging



	We may enter into derivative transactions with third parties, or sell securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately
	negotiated transactions. In connection with those derivatives, the third parties may sell securities covered by this prospectus, including in short sale transactions. If so, the third party may use securities pledged by us or borrowed from us or
	others to settle those sales or to close out any related open borrowings of securities, and may use securities received from us in settlement of those derivatives to close out any related open borrowings of securities. The third party in such sale
	transactions will be an underwriter or will be identified in a post-effective amendment to our registration statement on Form F-3.





	Indemnification



	Underwriters, dealers, agents and other persons may be entitled, under agreements that they may enter into with us, to indemnification
	by us against civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

	Market Making, Stabilization and Other Transactions



	In connection with an offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell securities in the open market and may engage in transactions that
	stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the securities offered. These transactions may include overalloting the offering, creating a syndicate short position, and engaging in stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions
	created by short sales. Overallotment involves sales of the securities in excess of the principal amount or number of the securities to be purchased by the underwriters in the applicable offering, which creates a short position for the underwriters.
	Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of securities than they are required to purchase in an offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a
	decline in the market price of the securities while an offering is in progress.


	The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This
	occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount it received because the underwriters have repurchased securities sold by or for the account of that underwriter in stabilizing or short-covering
	transactions.


	These activities by the underwriters may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the securities. As a
	result, the price of the securities may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the underwriters at any time. These transactions may be effected on an
	exchange or automated quotation system, if the securities are listed on that exchange or admitted for trading on that automated quotation system, or in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

	ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES



	We are a limited liability company incorporated in India. The majority of our directors and executive officers are residents of India and a
	substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these directors and executive officers is located in India. As a result, it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the United States upon those persons or us. In addition,
	you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in courts of the United States against those persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence, including judgments predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. Moreover, it is unlikely that
	a court in India would award damages on the same basis as a foreign court if an action were brought in India or that an Indian court would enforce foreign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages as excessive or inconsistent with public policy.


	Section 44A of the Indian Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, as amended, or the Civil Code, provides that where a foreign judgment has
	been rendered by a superior court (within the meaning of the section) in any country or territory outside of India which the Government of India has by notification declared to be a reciprocating territory, such foreign judgment may be enforced in
	India by proceedings in execution as if the judgment had been rendered by an appropriate court in India. However, the enforceability of such judgments is subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 13 of the Civil Code. This section, which
	is the statutory basis for the recognition of foreign judgments, states that a foreign judgment is conclusive as to any matter directly adjudicated upon except:


	 




	 


	


	 


	where the judgment has not been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction;




	 




	 


	


	 


	where the judgment has not been given on the merits of the case;




	 




	 


	


	 


	where the judgment appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognize the law of India in cases where such law is applicable;




	 




	 


	


	 


	where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice;




	 




	 


	


	 


	where the judgment has been obtained by fraud; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	where the judgment sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.




	Section 44A of the Civil Code is applicable only to monetary decrees not being in the nature of amounts payable in respect of taxes or
	other charges of a similar nature or in respect of fines or other penalties and does not include arbitration awards.


	If a judgment of a
	foreign court is not enforceable under Section 44A of the Civil Code as described above, it may be enforced in India only by a suit filed upon the judgment, subject to Section 13 of the Civil Code and not by proceedings in execution.
	Accordingly, as the United States has not been declared by the Government of India to be a reciprocating territory for the purposes of Section 44A, a judgment rendered by a court in the United States may not be enforced in India except by way
	of a suit filed upon the judgment.


	The suit must be brought in India within three years from the date of the judgment in the same manner
	as any other suit filed to enforce a civil liability in India. Generally, there are considerable delays in the disposition of suits by Indian courts.


	A party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment in India is required to obtain prior approval from the RBI, under FEMA to repatriate any amount
	recovered pursuant to such enforcement. Any judgment in a foreign currency would be converted into Indian rupees on the date of judgment and not on the date of payment.

	INTRODUCTION FROM OUR CHAIRMAN



	Our focus is always on our
	customers and what marks us out is a strong ethical code which has led to global business success.



	Cyrus Mistry,



	Chairman



	The Tata group exists to improve the quality of life of the communities we serve
	globally through long-term stakeholder value creation based on leadership with trust.



	We create value by making the right long-term commitments.



	Our focus is always on our customers and what marks us out is a strong ethical code which has led to global business success.



	It is our conviction that the interests of our customers, employees, financial stakeholders, franchise and supply chain partners and wider society are best served by our adherence
	to these principles. This sets us apart from many of our competitors.



	There are five core values which are the foundations of what we do: Integrity  we
	must conduct our business fairly, with honesty and transparency. Everything we do must stand the test of public scrutiny. Understanding  we must be caring, show respect, compassion and humanity for our colleagues and customers around the
	world, and always work for the benefit of the communities we serve.



	Excellence  we must constantly strive to achieve the highest possible standards in our
	day-to-day work and in the quality of the goods and services we provide.



	Unity  we must work cohesively with our colleagues across the Tata group and with
	our customers and partners around the world, building strong relationships based on tolerance, understanding and mutual co-operation.



	Responsibility  we must
	continue to be responsible and sensitive to the countries, communities and environments in which we work, always ensuring that what comes from the people goes back to the people many times over.



	This years economic conditions have been challenging but Jaguar Land Rovers solid financial performance demonstrates the power of adhering to our core values.



	The signs are that these economic circumstances will continue for the foreseeable future. Jaguar Land Rover has the talent and determination to overcome them.



	Reflecting the Tata groups strategic goal of sustainable profitable growth, the Company has reaffirmed its long-term commitment to the UK.



	Our 5 core values:



	Integrity Understanding



	Excellence Unity Responsibility

	Wolverhampton will double in size and other large investments across several other facilities in the country have been confirmed.



	To support global expansion, our
	facility in Brazil has been completed and plans for a new plant in Slovakia are being implemented.



	Our commitment to long-term sustainable profitable growth in
	Jaguar Land Rover was made when Tata Motors acquired it in 2008.



	Holding to our strategy conceived under Mr. Ratan N. Tata, the Company has been transformed and
	grown whatever the prevailing economic circumstances. As a result it has, this year, produced and sold more vehicles than ever before.



	Tata has continually
	recommitted to the Jaguar Land Rover plan founded on three pillars  to put the Customer First, produce Great Products and focus on Environmental Innovation.



	That will continue, as will our determination to deliver on our purpose to improve the lives of all in the communities in which we operate.

	CEOS STATEMENT



	Outstanding British design, allied to
	creative engineering and technological breakthroughs means that Jaguar Land Rover continues to produce vehicles which excite the senses, go above and beyond and give our customers experiences they love, for life.



	Dr. Ralf Speth,



	Chief Executive Officer



	Jaguar Land Rover this year produced and sold more cars than at any time in our history.



	We
	are now the largest automotive manufacturer in the United Kingdom.



	Thirteen major product actions including three all-new vehicles  the Discovery Sport, and
	Jaguar XE and XF  have redefined their market segments.



	Our workforce increased to nearly 38,000 people with almost 3,000 new recruits including 600
	graduates. We were also voted the best place to work in the UK in a survey of the countrys 400 largest employers carried out by Bloomberg.



	These
	achievements  in a year of macroeconomic, monetary and geopolitical challenges  led to solid financial results.



	We weathered those storms by staying
	true to our principles and executing our strategy for long-term sustainable growth built on the three pillars of putting the Customer First, making Great Products and Environmental Innovation.



	Outstanding British design, allied to creative engineering and technological breakthroughs means that Jaguar Land Rover continues to produce vehicles which excite the senses, go
	above and beyond and give our customers experiences they love, for life.

	SOLID FINANCIAL RESULTS



	The slowdown in the Chinese economy had an adverse impact not just in that market but also on global demand. Conditions in emerging markets weakened and there was
	a softening in growth in the United States at the end of 2015.



	The Tianjin explosion in August led to a tragic loss of life. At the time we had nearly 5,800
	vehicles stored in the vicinity which were destroyed or damaged, resulting in a £245 million exceptional charge in the second quarter of Fiscal 2016.



	Despite
	these headwinds Jaguar Land Rover delivered solid financial results.



	In Fiscal 2016 we sold almost 522,000 vehicles, up 13 per cent year-on-year.



	Revenue increased to in excess of £22 billion and EBITDA was solid at £3.3 billion, with an EBITDA margin of 14.9 per cent and pre-tax profit of more than £1.5
	billion.



	INNOVATION OUR SUCCESS IS KEY TO



	Investing over-proportionally
	in technology, infrastructure and talent is critical to the future of the Company and we continue to do so.



	We have invested in excess of £3.1 billion in
	product creation and capital spending this year, once again more than any other UK automotive company.



	This spend is enabling us to offer new technologies and
	increase product substance to produce highly competitive vehicles which inspire and excite our customers.



	We are global leaders in lightweight aluminium
	technology.



	Through our REALCAR project we now lead the world in aluminium recycling and manufacture. The new closed loop process saved 50,000 tonnes
	of aluminium in 2015 alone equating in environmental terms to a reduction of 500,000 tonnes of carbon.



	Our groundbreaking Ingenium engines deliver new levels of
	efficiency. The InControl Touch Pro Infotainment System, designed entirely in-house, leads the industry in connectivity.

	Our mission is to make great products that excite our customers and exceed their
	aspirations.



	To unleash the skills and imaginations of our people and by doing so push the boundaries of the possible.



	We are on record as saying that we thought it was in the interests of our company and the country to remain in the European Union.



	However, we are confident that whatever the future arrangements we have with our European neighbours, we will prosper as a British and global company.



	We are respected worldwide as a lifestyle company, delivering the very best of British design, creative engineering and innovation.



	Our vision is a long-term one. To put our Customers First and deliver for them experiences they love, for life.

	Jaguars heritage of elegant design and
	breathtaking performance has excited and delighted the world for 80 years.



	Living up to its history in the year when the iconic E-type was chosen as
	the Best British Car Ever was quite a task. But we rose to it.



	In 2015  the Year of the Cat  Jaguar completed a family of world-class sports
	cars and saloons that are modern, progressive and relevant.



	They are also every bit as elegant and stunning as their predecessors.



	XE, XF and XJ  three remarkable, much admired and award-winning saloon cars.



	The
	dramatic F-TYPE, joined by the hotly-anticipated F-PACE.



	Each with all-wheel-drive. Engineered from lightweight aluminium. With our distinctive style and
	passion. All with engineering integrity and reliability.



	We are proud of our traditions at Jaguar  an inheritance of innovation and British ingenuity,
	of elegance and style, of performance and delivery.



	And we are proud of the transformation at Jaguar which allows us to offer a range of cars of maturity
	and excellence like never before.



	The new Jaguar family. Truly standing on the shoulders of giants.

	Almost 70 years ago, the Wilks brothers stood on a wet beach in Wales and drew the design of a car with a stick.



	Seven decades on, we can truly say that never before were such sure and strong foundations built on sand.



	What the Wilks brothers did that day was not an idle drawing. It was the design of an icon that mobilised communities around the globe. The first Land Rover.



	We have built on those foundations.



	This year Range Rover  the worlds first SUV
	 celebrated its 45th birthday by launching the SVAutobiography and setting new standards in luxury.



	The landmark six-millionth Land Rover was a Range Rover
	Vogue SE, which rolled off the Solihull production line in April.



	Innovation is as key today as it was on that Welsh beach, with industry-leading lightweight
	all-aluminium body construction, Terrain Response 2 and All-Terrain Progress Control.



	No longer designed on a beach, Land Rover is still going above and
	beyond.

	22 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC



	Annual Report
	201516



	MARKET OVERVIEW



	SEVEN TRENDS INFLUENCING OUR INDUSTRY



	The automotive industry is on the brink of revolutionary change. Through our innovation, research and development Jaguar Land Rover will shape that change.



	Future success will be based on a continuous process of anticipating new market trends. As we look ahead, we are guided by our strategic plan as well as our
	proprietary scenario-mapping tools that identify the biggest and fastest-growing opportunities progressing the industry. We will stay ahead of the market by focusing on the innovation, design and creativity that our customers love.



	COMPLEXITY AND UNCERTAINTY



	Tighter fuel economy regulations around the world and the
	requirement for more safety- related features to be included as standard on new models will increase the level of complexity for the sector. The speed of adoption of new technologies will depend on the interaction between consumer demand and
	regulation, leading to greater uncertainty.



	WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US



	We are the
	leaders in lightweighting and aerodynamic drag-reducing technologies, as well as investing substantially in advanced innovation and alternative powertrains. Our latest range of vehicles all meet the highest safety standards. We are also pioneering
	collaborative projects with partners to answer the challenges of the evolving landscape.



	THE NEW CITY SEGMENT



	As cities across the globe adopt their own regulation, the City Type will become the new indicator for mobility behaviour that will determine the speed and scope of the
	automotive revolution. For example, by 2030, the car market in New York will likely have much more in common with the market in Shanghai than with that of Kansas. This trend looks set to replace the traditional regional perspective that has shaped
	the industry until now.



	WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US



	Jaguar Land Rovers
	emphasis to be closer to the customer will ensure a granular view of new opportunities as regulatory and behavioural trends within cities shape the future.



	A NEW
	WORLD OF CONNECTED AND INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY



	Greater demand for seamless connectivity, entertainment and safety is driving the digitalisation of the car. Vehicles
	with high-speed broadband internet connection, digital safety features and autonomous driving capability are the next frontier in the differentiation of the car, with todays high-end features expected as standard tomorrow.



	WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US



	Innovation is at the heart of our business as we continue to enhance
	the customer proposition and gain ground against our competition. Our InControl Touch Pro infotainment system already leads the industry and we are the first to launch the UKs real-world testing of connected and autonomous vehicle technology.

	InMotion



	NEW OWNERSHIP MODELS



	Consumer behaviour is changing, with increased car sharing and the
	emergence of a market for intelligent mobility solutions. Customers today use their cars as all-purpose vehicles, whether they are commuting alone to work or taking the family on holiday to the mountains. In the future, they may want the flexibility
	to choose the best solution for a specific purpose.



	WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US



	The traditional business model of car sales will be complemented by a range of diverse, on-demand mobility solutions, especially in dense urban environments. To
	answer this new trend, we have launched InMotion: an exciting new technology business that will create apps and on-demand services to provide solutions to modern travel and transport challenges.



	CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE



	Alongside the demand for greater connectivity, consumers are increasingly
	using digital sources in making their purchase decisions. Potential car buyers can already access a tremendous amount of information from the internet, with digital only increasing in importance in the future. Retailers are expected to remain
	important in the overall purchasing journey but less so in the research comparison stages.



	WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US



	An accessible and innovative web presence is critical alongside new retail concepts that offer a premium and personalised brand experience. Jaguar Land Rover and our retailers will
	offer more convenient proactive services, alerting drivers to upcoming maintenance and product updates. We are also increasingly aligning our processes to address new challenges like cybersecurity and data privacy.



	CUSTOMER LOYALTY



	With increased access to information and cross-brand price comparison
	behaviour, consumers flit between brands and products in their search for value and novelty. Inspiring consumer loyalty is increasingly testing.



	The impact of new
	challenger brands from other sectors is also putting pressure on traditional automotive players.



	WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US



	Value hunting does not necessarily mean the best price. Agnostic consumers are intrigued by innovation and will still pay a premium for quality, personal and inspirational
	experiences. Jaguar Land Rovers focus on innovation, technology and premium quality lifestyle experiences delivered through Customer First initiatives is tackling this challenge head on.



	NEW COMPETITION



	With new entrants into the automotive market  from mobility providers,
	tech giants and speciality OEMs  the competitive market is set to further increase in complexity. Within the next few years, the market may well expect production versions of experimental cars to be developed by new entrants such
	as Apple and Google to further challenge established automotive brands.



	WHAT THIS MEANS FOR US



	Being agile and innovative through the development of new technologies, powertrains and platforms like InMotion, Jaguar Land Rover will continue to provide relevant,
	engaging and invaluable experiences to both new and existing customers globally.

	Annual Report
	201516



	OUR PASSIONS



	CUSTOMER FIRST



	Our customers  present and future  are at the heart of everything we do. We are constantly investigating their current and potential needs to feed fresh ideas into our
	product planning cycle. We are always restless to be better and aim to continuously improve the customer experience at every touchpoint. Always putting the Customer First.



	OUR PHILOSOPHY



	Jaguar Land Rover seeks to exceed the expectations of our customers through
	greater focus on understanding and fulfilling their needs. Putting the Customer First.



	Our future success can only be achieved if we truly place them at the heart
	of our business and centre of our attentions.



	LISTENING TO OUR CUSTOMERS



	We
	seek to develop deep, unique insights into what our customers need and what their ambitions are. And not just our existing ones.



	Young people between the ages of

	CASE STUDY: CUSTOMER FIRST; 100,000TH
	DISCOVERY SPORT



	Surprise and delight are sensations our Customer First passion seeks to inspire. This was especially true when Land Rover marked the production of
	the 100,000th Discovery Sport this year with a special surprise for one mum, Natalie Lipton, on Mothers Day. The Lipton family had unwittingly purchased that particular vehicle that was built at Jaguar Land Rovers Halewood manufacturing
	plant, just 10 miles from their family home. To celebrate the milestone, which was reached just days before Mothers Day in the UK, Land Rover went undercover with her sons Jacob, 7, and Noah, 5, to find out just how this car could be made even
	more special for their mum. To bring the boys ideas to life, a team of designers, suppliers and experts from Jaguar Land Rovers Special Vehicle Operations worked to create special touches in the car during production. Like her boys, we
	put mother first.



	FUTURE PLANS



	 Increase the number of consumer
	interactions across more advisory boards and products, growing the voice of the consumer and our Customer First passion in Jaguar Land Rover



	 Implementing
	consumer reviews onto our brand websites to amplify customer advocacy



	 Increase transparency of our customer experience through reviews at the retailer level
	to help develop the overall retail experience

	Annual Report
	201516



	OUR PASSIONS



	ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION



	OUR PHILOSOPHY



	Reducing emissions is one of the biggest challenges for the automotive industry
	today. As the UKs biggest investor in automotive R&D, we are developing a range of solutions to reduce the carbon footprint of our vehicles and improve air quality while maintaining the luxury, performance and refinement that our customers
	expect.



	Environmental Innovation lies at the centre of our business vision. It is a wide-ranging plan that will see us dramatically reduce real-world emissions up
	to 2020 and beyond.



	OUR 2015/16 FOCUS



	This year we have invested more than
	£3.1 billion in new products and facilities as part of the programme.



	The electrification of powertrains is essential to reduce the carbon footprint of
	vehicles and meet future climate change mitigation targets. This is why over the last seven years we have been researching and developing a range of advanced plug-in hybrid (PHEV), mild hybrid (MHEV) and battery electric vehicle (BEV) propulsion
	systems.



	The biggest single project is a £16.2 million collaborative research programme, part-funded by Innovate UK, called Evoque_e.



	This project looks beyond 2020 to explore all aspects of future hybrid and battery electric vehicle technology and has so far produced three Concept_e demonstrators.



	Jaguar is also returning to the racetrack through Formula E. This is an exciting opportunity to support our extensive multi-billion pound hybrid and battery electric propulsion
	research and test bed activity.



	As well as hybridisation and electrification, we are working to make our vehicles lighter while improving our internal combustion
	engines to make them cleaner and more energy efficient.



	Our highly efficient diesel Ingenium engine achieves just 109g/km CO2 in our new Evoque. At the same
	time, the all-new Jaguar XE with just 99g/km of CO2, is the most efficient Jaguar ever built.



	To enable us to include the Ingenium engine in even more new models,
	we are investing £450 million to double the size of our Engine Manufacturing Centre near Wolverhampton.



	Our leadership in lightweight aluminium vehicle
	architecture has been extended to include the Jaguar XE, Jaguar F-PACE and all-new Jaguar XF, significantly reducing the weight of the body.



	Jaguar Land Rover is
	the largest user of sheet aluminium in the UK, and is a world leader in recycling this metal with our unique closed loop process, continuously developing new ways of cutting waste.



	Recognising the importance of investing in skills and talent for the future, since 2008 we have doubled the number of powertrain engineers.



	In the last year alone, 1,480 of Jaguar Land Rovers 9,000 engineers and designers spent 293,550 hours at universities studying Masters level modules, including hybrid
	vehicles, sustainable design and lightweight vehicles. Today, we are collaborating with more than 30 leading universities working on in excess of 100 projects.



	KEY
	2015/16 SUCCESSES



	 Our UK manufacturing sites have achieved more than 38 per cent reduction in energy per car produced since 2007



	 60 energy saving projects delivered, totalling £23 million and more than 57,000 tonnes of annualised CO2 equivalent savings, thanks to a mix of measures including
	roof-mounted solar panels, LED lighting, combined heat and power and heat distribution optimisation, building management systems, voltage optimisation, insulation and energy mapping

	CASE STUDY: REALCAR;
	ALUMINIUM WASTE REDUCTION



	REALCAR (Recycled Aluminium Car) is a partnership between Jaguar Land Rover and Novelis which has enabled 50,000 tonnes of
	press shop aluminium scrap  equivalent to saving approximately 500,000 tonnes of CO2  to be recovered over the last year.



	The project, part-funded by
	Innovate UK, has seen 10 UK press shops implement a unique closed loop



	process, segregating waste aluminium scrap, so that it can be sent back to Novelis to be
	re-melted into recycled aluminium sheets for use in our cars. Aluminium recycling requires up to 95 per cent less energy than primary aluminium production, making our operations more sustainable.



	REALCAR has also seen the development of a new aluminium alloy  RC5754  which accepts increasing amounts of recycled aluminium automotive scrap, currently by up
	to 50 per cent.



	The Jaguar XE is the first car in the world to make volume use of this new structural grade of aluminium. It has also been tested and
	implemented in the lightweight aluminium body structures of the Jaguar XF and F-PACE models. Using it to build future Jaguar and Land Rover models will take us a significant step towards our goal of achieving 75 per cent recycled aluminium content
	in our vehicle body structures by 2020.



	OUR REAL CAR CLOSED LOOP PROCESS ENABLED



	50,000



	TONNES OF PRESS SHOP ALUMINIUM SCRAP



	TO BE RECOVERED OVER THE LAST YEAR FUTURE PLANS



	 By 2020, our
	environmental programme aims to achieve carbon neutral manufacturing operations, zero waste and to produce vehicles that will be amongst the leaders in their segments on tailpipe emissions



	 By 2020, we aim to use up to 75 per cent recycled aluminium materials in our cars and, as a result, improve the recycling efficiency of our manufacturing cycle

	OUR PASSIONS



	ENVIRONMENTAL INNOVATION



	OUR PHILOSOPHY



	Environmental sustainability is not just about the final products but also how
	we make them. Thats why we measure the environmental impact not just of our cars but also of their manufacture from weld to wheel.



	We continually assess
	every single aspect of our manufacturing processes  day by day  tirelessly seeking to improve them. It is this continuous aggregation of marginal gains which will have the biggest positive impact on our environment. Its not just
	about being a good global citizen  its our planet too.



	KEY 2015/16 SUCCESSES



	 Our life cycle assessment has contributed to significant improvements in our fleet average tailpipe CO2 emissions since 2007



	 Our innovative Ingenium diesel engines already achieve just 99g/km CO2 in the Jaguar XE



	 XF is up to 190kg lighter than its predecessor



	FUTURE PLANS



	 By 2020 new technologies will help Jaguar Land Rover reduce its CO2 emissions by a further 25 per cent



	CASE STUDY: LAND ROVER DISCOVERY SPORT VEHICLE LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT*



	To achieve the
	breakthroughs we seek, we use the knowledge gained through life cycle assessment  independently verified scientific studies of vehicle life cycle impacts  in alignment with international standards.



	Its an integrated approach that provides the technically rigorous data we need to deliver step changes in sustainability. Jaguar Land Rover was one of the first UK vehicle
	manufacturers to complete such assessments.



	Land Rover Discovery Sport has life cycle impacts in equivalent CO2 terms which are more than 10 per cent lower than
	the previous model and is the lowest life cycle impact vehicle ever in the Discovery family of vehicles.



	OUR FOCUS



	LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT STAGES



	RAW MATERIALS



	AND COMPONENTS



	We work with our suppliers on improvements that deliver sustainability
	win-wins.

	Efficient factories that save energy, water and waste help drive down the life cycle impact of the vehicles we create.



	OUR VEHICLES IN USE



	From lighter, more efficient vehicles and investment in hybrid and
	electric vehicles, were pursuing innovation on every front.



	TRANSPORTING VEHICLES TO CUSTOMERS



	We are switching from road to rail or sea where possible and supporting our service providers to obtain the precise data that will help drive even more efficient operations.



	END



	Before the vehicles exist in physical format we can use virtual design to
	engineer and assess key systems for recycling and reuse  which could be 30 years before the vehicle actually reaches the end of its life.

	RETAIL SALES AND DEVELOPMENT



	Customer response has been extremely positive this year,
	resulting in record sales across UK, North America and Europe. We have continued to experience best-ever retails with 13 per cent growth in 2015/16, continuing our run of year-on-year growth  every year  since 2010. This is in spite
	of economic volatility, particularly in some of the emerging markets, and the impact of economic slowdown in China.



	2016 promises to be another exciting year, with
	the start of sales of the Range Rover Evoque Convertible and the Jaguar F-PACE, along with further all-new and refreshed vehicles.



	CASE STUDY: IMPROVING OUR BRANDS
	IN RETAIL



	Over the next few years the implementation of the new ARCH concept will transform Jaguar Land Rovers retail brand identity into a crisp, modern
	retail design language, supporting the brand positioning for both Jaguar and Land Rover. Our Global Franchise Partners will invest several billion pounds in either totally new or redeveloped facilities throughout the world, delivering a world-class
	retail experience for our customers. We will continue to pursue our successful dual-brand franchise strategy, bringing both brands together under one roof.



	A
	number of ARCH Brand Statement Sites and Boutique locations will also be introduced into key geographical locations over the next 12 months or so. Our Customer First approach, augmented by increasing brand presence and customer accessibility, will
	enhance our Retailers profitability. The next 12 months will see the full global adoption of Jaguar Land Rovers Customer First principles, embedding them throughout the Sales and Marketing community to support the Customer First
	philosophy.

	Overseas 18% UK 20% Jaguar Land Rover retail sales hit record highs
	for the fifth consecutive year with 521,571 units sold in Fiscal 2016, up 13 per cent year-on-year. Higher retail sales in the UK, North America and Europe were offset by lower sales in China and sales volumes in Overseas markets were comparable to
	last year. 521,571 UNITS SOLD 13% Higher sales in the UK and Europe reflect the success of the XE and Discovery Sport as well as continued demand for the Range Rover Evoque. Sales of the Range Rover and Range Rover Sport also performed well in
	Europe. Stronger sales in North America were primarily driven by the Discovery Sport, Discovery and Range Rover products as well as the Jaguar XF and F-TYPE with the XE not launched there until May 2016. 19% North America Sales in China were lower
	during the first nine months of the year, reflecting softer economic conditions and the timing of new model launches. However, sales have been improving and were higher in the final quarter, up 19 per cent year-on-year, reflecting the successful
	launch and strong demand for the locally produced Discovery Sport as well as improving sales of the Evoque from our China Joint Venture. Total retail sales from our China Joint Venture were 31,765 units for the year. 24% 19% The new Jaguar XE and
	Land Rover Discovery Sport drove sales in Overseas markets but were slightly offset by softer sales of other models. Europe China** * Jaguar Land Rover retail sales represent vehicle sales made by dealers to end customers and include the sale of

	Annual Report
	201516



	OUR FOUNDATIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH



	SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS
	THROUGH EFFICIENCY



	OUR PHILOSOPHY



	To deliver sustainable profitable long-term
	growth we must take the right steps to be well positioned financially. Ongoing initiatives on efficiency, productivity and cost management are maintaining our competitiveness, as well as strategic programmes to protect continued investment in new
	products. Alongside our business focus, we are also working to provide innovation for good and benefit the communities which we serve.



	OUR FOCUS



	A major business transformation programme is underway across Jaguar Land Rover to drive a step change in performance across a number of our activities. While driving down costs is
	an essential part of the programme, the emphasis is on increasing profitability to fund future investment plans and improving operations across the entire company.



	SMARTER WORKING



	Every employee has been asked to contribute and to generate
	ideas to improve how we work. Everyone is involved in eliminating waste, creating efficiencies and ensuring a more sustainable and profitable future for the business.



	These ideas have ranged from simple measures, such as new ways of teleconferencing, to reducing the overall complexity of our business  challenging our existing processes and
	the assumptions which underpin them. Some of the ideas will drive quick wins in our bottom line by 2018, while a second deadline of 2021 has been set for transformational change.



	The programme is progressing towards the goal of employees thinking as business owners for their part of the Company, improving each area and working with their
	colleagues in other functions as a single team, to make the right business decisions and ensure Jaguar Land Rover is best placed for the future.



	CASE THE:
	STREAMLINING PROCESS STUDY



	Listening to those who actually do the job is frequently the best way to increase efficiency and effectiveness in our manufacturing and
	business processes.



	Team improvement circles use the experience and knowledge of our staff to propose, develop and implement ways of smarter working



	In our Engine Manufacturing Centre a team of production line employees identified and implemented an effective engine-part fitting process that has resulted in a 65 per cent
	improvement in efficiency. The team measured that on any given shift an employee who looked after the engine-parts trolley as it moved along the production line would walk up to 12km to return the trolley to the start.



	By making one change to the production line process the staff have reduced the amount of time and distance an employee travels per shift resulting in a significant improvement
	in value added to the business.

	LEADERSHIP THROUGH BUSINESS EXCELLENCE



	OUR PHILOSOPHY



	We use the Tata Business Excellence Model (TBEM) which is
	based on the Malcolm Baldrige model of the US. TBEM is an integrated approach to performance management and is built on beliefs and behaviours found in high performing organisations.



	This helps us to align our workforce, suppliers, partners and other components of the supply chain, and enables all to work towards improvement of overall organisational
	effectiveness, efficiency and capabilities.



	The model is focused on strategy and process-driven results and is the basis of conducting organisational assessments.
	Jaguar Land Rover has participated in three assessments since 2011 to assess its maturity and progress on the excellence scale, and has used the feedback to focus on improvement actions.



	OUR FOCUS



	All of our processes have been organised into key work systems describing how work
	is accomplished and enables cross-functional engagement for operational effectiveness.



	Our journey towards process maturity is enabled through a web-based resource
	called The Jaguar Land Rover Way which captures the way we work, think and act.



	Process excellence is the bedrock of our business and enables us to
	deliver leadership through our products and services with the core purpose of giving our customers experiences they will love, for life.

	JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC



	Annual Report 201516



	OUR APPROACH TO RISK



	We operate in the premium automotive sector and face a number of risks as a competitor in this sector. We manage and monitor these risks and the factors which could impact our
	plans for long-term sustainable growth.



	DEFINING RISK



	Risk is an event which
	could materially affect (compromise or enhance) our ability to achieve our objectives or impact our reputation. The risks identified may also present growth opportunities. We recognise that risk is inherent in all business activities and must be
	balanced when assessing returns. Successful management of these risks is therefore key to accomplishing our strategic objectives and the long-term sustainable growth of our business. Enterprise risk management is used as a tool to identify, assess,
	control and



	continually monitor key risks that could affect our business objectives.



	RISK MANAGEMENT



	To achieve an informed understanding of our tolerance for risk when delivering
	our overall business plan, we must be mindful that the goal of risk management is not to eliminate risk, but to ensure that the risks that we do accept remain within a predetermined level of acceptability whilst pursuing value-enhancing
	opportunities.



	We also recognise that a healthy and responsible risk management framework does not encourage over-speculation but it should not default to promote
	excess conservatism either.



	The ultimate goal of risk management within Jaguar Land Rover is to build resilience against any internal or external shocks, both
	anticipated and unforeseen.



	RESPONSIBILITY FOR RISK



	The Executive Committee
	is ultimately responsible for managing risk within Jaguar Land Rover. However, the wider organisation is responsible for the proactive day-to-day management of them.



	The Executive Committee Members regularly review our key risks to monitor the progress of mitigating actions, identify new risks, concur changes to existing risks
	profiles and undertake any additional actions to manage risk that may be required as the business environment changes.



	Principal risks and exceptions are reported
	to the Audit Committee regularly to assist in the decision-making process and ensure adequate controls are in place to support the business.



	OUR APPROACH TO RISK
	MANAGEMENT:



	ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM) HELPS PRESERVE OUR VALUES AND MAINTAIN RESILIENCE



	The ERM framework helps us to identify new and evolving risks and opportunities so that we can understand and manage risks that may materially impact our business objectives.



	The ERM framework is also an effective communication tool used by senior management to monitor and gain consensus on how to manage the principal risks to the
	business, increasing the likelihood of successful mitigation and/or identifying opportunities.



	THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS DYNAMIC, AS ARE THE RISKS WE
	FACE



	We plan for certain known changes to the industry and external environment whilst remaining sufficiently flexible for rapid and unknown changes that are
	inherently difficult to anticipate.



	Managing the changing environment in which we operate and having the ability to cope with sudden unforeseen challenges ensures
	long-term sustainability of the business and healthy profitable growth.



	RISK MANAGEMENT: IDENTIFICATION, ASSESSMENT, EVALUATION, RESPONSE AND REPORTING



	By continuing to monitor and assess risks as well as embedding the management of such risks within our culture, we can identify new material risks and opportunities early on to
	take advantage of value-adding prospects and mitigating value-eroding threats.



	We also continue to evaluate and report risks and opportunities to enable us to
	prioritise effectively and form effective responses.

	RESILIENCE



	ORGANISATION



	A cross-functional network of risk champions coordinates the identification, monitoring and management of risks within their respective functional areas. A central Enterprise Risk
	Management team consolidates risk information and data from each champion as well as collating risk reporting to the Executive Committee and the Jaguar Land Rover Board.



	PROCESS



	We aim to embed risk management into the day-to-day activities of each business
	function to instil risk into the mindset and business decision-making process. The standardisation of risk management processes across functions supports a consistency in our approach to risk management, facilitating its use and enhancing its
	effectiveness.



	TOOLS & TRAINING



	We embed common risk management tools,
	techniques, language and approaches to engender cross- functional consistency of risk identification, assessment, monitoring and reporting. This ensures that risks are appropriately captured and calibrated consistently across the organisation.



	REPORTING



	Our risk reporting is structured to inform the appropriate
	stakeholders promptly to aid in the decision- making process related to risk management. Reporting also allows us to effectively categorise risks so that appropriate working groups discuss relevant risks to ensure that high quality input is received
	and appropriate mitigation strategies are proposed.



	CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT



	Our risk management process is expected to evolve over time and is designed to enable the assimilation of best practice from prior experience and external
	benchmarking, facilitating continuous improvement year- on-year. This process ensures that the risk management process becomes more efficient over time and changes as the business grows.

	50 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC



	Annual Report
	201516



	OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS



	Risks are identified, assessed and measured
	against a defined set of criteria to consider the likelihood of occurrence and potential impact to the business facilitated by our Enterprise Risk Management framework. Plotting our principal risks on a risk map helps to visualise each risk profile
	as well as targeting to bring each risk back within a tolerable level.



	OUR 10 PRINCIPAL RISKS



	1. Global economic and geopolitical environment



	2. Environmental regulations
	and compliance



	3. Competitive business efficiency



	4. Brand positioning



	5. Product liability and recalls



	6. Exchange rate fluctuations



	7. Global expansion



	8. Distribution channels



	9. Patent and IP protection



	10. Unethical and prohibited business practices



	Key: Net risk profile (including mitigations)



	Current risks



	Target net risk profile



	CHANGES TO OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS DURING FISCAL 2016



	Our principal risks change as our business evolves and the external environment changes. In Fiscal 2016 we have focused more on the potential impact of certain regional market
	developments, industry-specific events and placed more emphasis on the protection of our intellectual property.

	ORANGE ZONE Risks that are highly likely to occur and could materially impact our ability to reach our business objectives.



	BEIGE ZONE Risks that remain at tolerable levels but could impact the business unless monitored and managed.



	BLUE ZONE Risks that are unlikely to materialise and are unlikely to materially impact our business.



	TWO PRINCIPAL RISKS INTRODUCED



	5. Product liability and recalls 9. Patent and IP protection



	Recent events and increased focus has raised the respective profiles of both risks. Mitigating actions are in place (as detailed on pages 52 and 53) to address the
	higher intensity of risk to the business as a result.



	ONE RISK HAS CEASED TO BE A PRINCIPAL RISK



	Supply chain



	Plans and mitigating actions put in place since Fiscal 2015 have proved effective
	in reducing our exposure to these risks and are now back to more tolerable levels.

	Annual Report
	201516



	OUR PRINCIPAL RISKS



	The principal risks faced by Jaguar Land
	Rover are outlined below. The risks discussed are not exhaustive and Jaguar Land Rover may be subject to other risks not specifically outlined in this Annual Report.



	Risk driver Potential consequences Mitigating these risks



	STRATEGIC RISKS



	1. GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENT



	Our expanding global presence
	increases our exposure to global economic and geopolitical risks and external factors such as the recent UK referendum to leave the EU, political instability, wars, terrorism, natural disasters, fuel shortages, epidemics and labour strikes which may
	impact our operations. Uncertainty from inconsistencies and ambiguity in economic and government policies as well as commercial employment practices may also impact our business.



	We derive a significant proportion of our revenues from China, North America and continental Europe as well as domestic sales in the UK. Therefore we are exposed to potential
	fluctuations in the demand for our vehicles and disruption to our supply chain driven by global and geopolitical shocks which may have a direct impact on sales volumes and our financial results.



	We aim to avoid an over-reliance on any one market by continuing to expand our international presence (i.e. manufacturing in Slovakia and Austria) and maintain a balanced sales
	portfolio of circa 20 per cent of retail volume from each key region. We recognise the risks inherent in increasing sales to new markets and we factor such risk into our business planning process. We continue to closely monitor geopolitical and
	wider global economic developments and we will be closely monitoring developments following the UK referendum to leave the EU.



	4. BRAND POSITIONING



	Building on the strength of our two world renowned brands is imperative to current and future success. Brand positioning is becoming increasingly challenging as the wider
	automotive market and digital environment develops where new competitors are emerging and existing competitors are evolving.



	Our inability to successfully position
	and maintain brand strength in the future could impact customer demand for our products. Failing to meet customer preferences, develop new products in line with market trends or suffering delayed products launches could drive existing and potential
	customers to choose competitor products.



	Recent successful model launches have broadened our product offering to existing and new customers in existing and new
	segments. Furthermore, we also regularly monitor brand health to quickly identify risks and/or opportunities that may arise as well as supporting initiatives designed to manage residual values.



	7. GLOBAL EXPANSION



	As our international sales and manufacturing footprint increases we become
	increasingly exposed to such external factors as geopolitical risks, natural disasters, epidemics, inconsistency and ambiguity of economic and governmental policies, the interpretation of local laws and regulations and taxation systems.



	As a consequence of these external factors, our sales and production operations could be subject to various forms of disruption resulting in a reduction of sales/production volumes
	or losses which could materially impact our financial results and ultimately could impact on our ability to fund future investment.



	We currently have a balanced
	sales profile with the five key sales regions, each accounting for circa 20 per cent of retail volumes. We continue to expand our international manufacturing base to complement our international sales profile and closely monitor geopolitical and
	wider global economic developments.



	OPERATIONAL RISKS



	5. PRODUCT
	LIABILITY AND RECALLS



	INCREASED RISK FOCUS IN FISCAL 2016



	We are subject to
	risks associated with product liability and recalls affecting our products. This may cause existing and potential customers to question the quality of Jaguar Land Rover products, the negative reputational ramifications of which could be exacerbated
	through social and other media.



	Operational anomalies that impact quality are likely to drive higher incidence of product recalls and an increase in related costs
	as well as warranty claims. In addition, our reputation could be adversely impacted and we could be the subject of class actions or other large-scale product liability and/or other lawsuits as a consequence.



	We regularly monitor the service data of our vehicles, via our global dealer network, and take appropriate actions to manage recalls and minimise warranty claims. The Company also
	issues technical updates to the dealer network to provide awareness of known vehicle faults, in line with general industry practices.



	8. DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS



	Our products are sold and serviced through a network of authorised dealers, service centres and distributors in markets around the world. We maintain strong
	relationships with our sales network to ensure that a consistent high quality of customer service is maintained. However, there is a risk that our customer service could deteriorate.



	Our sales network is key to our success; therefore, any factors that impact those relationships or any underperformance from our sales network could impact sales volumes and our
	business results. If customer service and customer experience falls short of expectations, future sales and customer retention could be impacted.



	We monitor the
	performance of our dealers and distributors and provide them with support to ensure a high quality of service is maintained in line with our and customers expectations. We also maintain a customer-first approach in conjunction with our dealers
	and other distribution channels.

	Risk driver



	Potential consequences



	Mitigating these risks



	LEGAL RISKS



	2. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND COMPLIANCE



	We are subject to numerous laws, regulations and
	policies covering environmental aspects related to our vehicles and production facilities, including greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy, and this regulatory environment is constantly changing, exacerbating the risks we face. In addition, a
	number of our production facilities also require permits and/or licences to continue to operate.



	We may incur additional investment spending to upgrade products
	and manufacturing facilities, as well as increased running costs, to comply with policies and regulations to avoid facing significant civil penalties. Price pressures may also increase as various jurisdictions adopt fuel consumption or CO2 based
	vehicle taxation systems and our competitors may gain a competitive advantage by adopting new emissions and fuel efficient technologies before we do.



	We have
	invested substantially in lightweight architecture, developed a family of efficient four-cylinder engines and we continue to develop electrification technologies with plans to deploy plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles in future. We also
	retain an EU derogation, permitting more lenient fleet average CO2 targets under a certain sales threshold and we also hold ISO 14001 certification, the international standard for environmental management systems.



	9. PATENT AND IP (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) PROTECTION



	INCREASED RISK FOCUS IN FISCAL 2016



	New product launches and substantial investment in R&D to support the development of new products has resulted in higher accumulation of intellectual property
	that may be desirable to other organisations and we may be vulnerable to a breach of intellectual property (i.e. patents, copyright, designs & trademarks).



	If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, a material breach occurs or if we are restricted from using intellectual property obtained from others there
	could be an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, we could be held legally liable for infringing the intellectual property rights of others in the development, manufacture and sale of our products.



	We own (by way of patents and trademarks) or otherwise the legal rights in respect of a number of patents, copyrights, industrial designs, trademarks and other intellectual
	property relating to the design and manufacture. Furthermore we have a dedicated team of in-house specialists that manage matters relating to intellectual property.



	10. UNETHICAL AND PROHIBITED BUSINESS PRACTICES



	The accelerated growth of our
	business has resulted in the expansion of our operations overseas, increasing the complexity of the legal environments under which we operate. As we expand our international footprint we will become more exposed to the potential risks associated
	with different ethical standards and cultural norms.



	Non-compliance with ethical and/or legal practices may materially impact our reputation and could result in
	restrictions being placed on our operations (i.e. licences withheld) as well as regulatory investigations that could cause business disruption and potentially lead to the imposition of fines.



	To mitigate unethical and illegal behaviour we have a number of policies relating to anti-bribery/corruption and whistleblowing as well as sanctions and export controls. Our code
	of conduct and comprehensive training programmes support these policies and employees are required to certify their compliance on an annual basis.



	FINANCIAL RISKS



	3. COMPETITIVE BUSINESS EFFICIENCY



	Jaguar Land Rover has initiated programmes
	to optimise operating efficiency in response to the dynamic external environment including existing and emerging competitive challenges. However, there is a risk that these programmes do not deliver projected efficiencies and anticipated benefits
	may not accrue as expected.



	If we are unable to deliver the desired benefits from the planned efficiency programmes, our business results may be adversely
	impacted. Furthermore, Jaguar Land Rovers ability to compete successfully over the longer term and sustain profitable growth may be affected.



	Jaguar Land
	Rover has launched certain initiatives to reduce product and business complexity. We have robust project management processes in place to continually track progress against set targets and to address any issues that may arise immediately,
	complemented by external consultation as required.



	6. EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS



	Approximately 80 per cent of our revenue is derived from sales outside of the United Kingdom and we source a significant proportion of our components from suppliers in the
	Eurozone, however our reporting currency is Pounds Sterling. This drives significant exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency, notably sales denominated in US Dollars and Chinese Renminbi as well as costs denominated in Euro.



	Generally, a relatively stronger Pound Sterling could adversely impact earnings as the value of overseas sales is eroded. Longer-term strategic, translation and economic currency
	risk exists where there is a structural misalignment in the denomination of costs and revenues which exposes the Company to longer-term foreign exchange trends beyond our currency hedging programme.



	We manage transaction risk through the use of foreign currency derivatives to hedge forecast exposures in line with the currency hedging policy approved by the Board. Where
	possible, we aim to align our sourcing base with our international sales profile. The proportion of our debt denominated in US Dollars also provides a natural hedge, through revaluation, against our US Dollar denominated sales.

	56 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC Annual Report 201516 CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICERS STATEMENT £791m STRONG POSITIVE FREE
	CASH FLOW SUPPORTING ONGOING INVESTMENT Fiscal 2016 has been another strong year for Jaguar Land Rover with record sales volumes and revenue as well as solid profitability and strong positive cash flow. Kenneth Gregor, Chief Financial Officer
	Record retail volumes of 521,571 units and revenue of £22.2 billion in Fiscal 2016 marks the sixth successive year of growth for Jaguar Land Rover. The retail volumes represent a 13 per cent year-on-year increase with strong growth in the
	UK, North America and Europe, driven by the success of new products such as the Discovery Sport and the Jaguar XE. EBITDA was a solid £3.3 billion (14.9 per cent margin) before one-time reserves and charges of ££166 million
	for the US recall of potentially faulty passenger airbags supplied by Takata, doubtful debts and previously capitalised investment. This EBITDA and margin reflects the higher revenue as well as the generally favourable foreign exchange and commodity
	price environment, offset by less favourable market and product mix. Profit before tax of £1.6 billion was driven by the solid EBITDA, profits from our China Joint Venture, lower finance expense as well as lower revaluation of US Dollar debt
	and unrealised FX and commodity hedges. Offsetting these were higher depreciation and amortisation, a net exceptional charge of £157 million for vehicles destroyed or damaged in the Tianjin port explosion and £166 million for
	other one-time reserves and charges. Free cash flow was £791 million after total investment spending of £3.1 billion, before financing. We also paid a dividend of £150 million, out of free cash flow, to our parent Tata
	Motors in June 2015. Cash and financial deposits at 31 March 2016 were £4.65 billion and total liquidity was £6.5 billion, including an undrawn revolving credit facility of £1.87 billion. In Q3 Fiscal 2016 we announced our
	intent to build a manufacturing facility in Slovakia with an initial investment of £1 billion to add 150,000 units of annual capacity from late 2018. A potential further £500 million investment in the Slovakia plant could expand
	capacity to 300,000 units per annum. In addition, we announced incremental investment of £450 million to double capacity at our Engine Manufacturing Centre in the UK. Looking to Fiscal 2017, we plan to continue to deliver on our growth
	plans supported by the launch of recent and new products including the US launch of the Jaguar XE, the long wheel base Jaguar XF-L into the China joint venture, the Evoque Convertible and the Jaguar F-PACE, as well as other products yet to be
	announced. Investment spending in Fiscal 2017 is expected to be in the region of £3.75 billion as we continue to invest in new products and technology as well as capacity expansion to deliver profitable growth. We expect to continue to fund
	investment spending from operating cash, supported by proven access to capital markets as required. Kenneth Gregor Chief Financial Officer Jaguar Land Rover Automotive plc 18 July 2016

	CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT £22,208m FY16 REVENUE FY15: £21,866 MILLION FY16 EBITDA (MARGIN) (14.9%) £3,313m FY15: £4,132 MILLION (18.9%) FY16 PROFIT BEFORE TAX £1,557m FY15: £2,614 MILLION FY16 PROFIT
	AFTER TAX £1,312m FY15: £2,038 MILLION Revenue in Fiscal 2016 was £22.2 billion, up from the £21.9 billion in Fiscal 2015 primarily reflecting strong retail sales of 521,571 units (including sales from the China joint
	venture), up 13 per cent year-on-year, partially offset by less favourable market and product mix. The higher retail sales were driven by strong sales of the new Jaguar XE and Discovery Sport as well as higher sales in the UK, North America and
	Europe. The lower retail sales in China predominantly reflect the softer economic conditions there at the beginning of the year, the timing of new product launches and the transition of Evoque and Discovery Sport production to the China joint
	venture. We maintained a balanced portfolio of sales across our five geographical regions during the fiscal year and continue to grow our global sales presence. EBITDA was a solid £3,313 million (14.9 per cent margin) in Fiscal 2016,
	before one-time reserves and charges, compared to the record high EBITDA of £4,132 million (18.9 per cent margin) in the previous fiscal year. Lower profitability primarily reflects less favourable model and market mix as well as
	unfavourable revaluation of Euro payables, partially offset by higher sales volumes. Reported EBITDA was £3,147 million (14.2 per cent margin) after £166 million of one-time reserves and charges for the US recall of potentially
	faulty passenger airbags supplied by Takata, doubtful debts and previously capitalised investment. Profit before tax after was £1,557 million in Fiscal 2016, after the £166 million of one-time reserves and charges and a net
	£157 million exceptional charge related to vehicles destroyed or damaged in the Tianjin port explosion in August 2015. The profit before tax was down from a record £2,614 million in Fiscal 2015, reflecting the lower EBITDA
	described above. Higher depreciation and amortisation (£367 million) was more than offset by more favourable revaluation of US Dollar debt and mark-to-market of unrealised derivatives (£347 million), joint venture profits (up
	£70 million, primarily our share of profits from the China joint venture) and lower net interest expense (£35 million). Profit after tax was £1,312 million in Fiscal 2016 compared to the £2,038 million in the
	previous fiscal year. The effective tax rate of 16 per cent in Fiscal 2016 was lower than the 22 per cent in Fiscal 2015 primarily reflecting a £74 million deferred tax credit resulting from tax deductions available under the
	UKs Patent Box tax legislation; and a favourable one-time deferred tax credit of £63 million for enacted future reductions in the rate of UK Corporation Tax (from 20 per cent to 19 per cent for FY18FY20 and
	18 per cent thereafter).

	cash flow before financing was £791 million in Fiscal 2016 as solid EBITDA and positive working capital were more than sufficient to fund total investment spending of £3,135 million. The net increase in total cash and deposits at
	the fiscal year end was £388 million after £142 million of finance expenses and fees, £150 million dividend to our parent Tata Motors Limited and a £111 million reduction in debt. KEY DRIVERS TOTAL PRODUCT

	DEPOSITS £388m FY15: £804 MILLION Investment expenditure to expand our product portfolio, manufacturing capacity and technology was £3,135 million in Fiscal 2016 (14.1 per cent of revenue), compared to the
	£3,147 million in the prior fiscal year. In Fiscal 2016, £318 million of investment spending was expensed in EBITDA and the remaining £2,817 million was capitalised. Research and development accounted for
	£1,560 million (49.8 per cent) of investment spending whilst tangible and other investment spending accounted for the remaining £1,575 million (50.2 per cent). Positive inflows related to working capital and other non cash
	accruals were £413 million during the year primarily reflecting a favourable movement of £443 million in accounts payable. An increase of £477 million in inventory was more than offset by favourable movements in
	other liabilities, including pensions, warranty and other reserves. Free cash flow was £791 million in Fiscal 2016 driven by the solid £3,313 million EBITDA (including £318 million of expensed R&D) and positive
	working capital less taxes paid of £166 million, which funded total investment spending of £3,135 million as depicted above. In Fiscal 2016 other income of £48 million, primarily interest earned on cash and financial
	deposits, was also received within the year. The net change in cash and financial deposits in Fiscal 2016 was £388 million. The increase reflects free cash flow of £791 million less a £150 million dividend paid to Tata
	Motors limited in June 2015, a £111 million reduction in debt (including the redemption of the remaining 8.25 per cent March 2020 Sterling bonds and lower utilisation of a short-term debt facility), and finance expenses and fees of
	£142 million.

	Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements IFC19 2059 6071 72IBC 79 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 BACKGROUND AND OPERATIONS Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC (the Company) and its subsidiaries, (collectively referred to as the Group or JLR), designs, manufactures and sells a wide range of
	automotive vehicles. The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the UK. The address of its registered office is Abbey Road, Whitley, Coventry, CV3 4LF, United Kingdom. The Company is a subsidiary of Tata Motors Limited,
	India and acts as an intermediate holding company for the Jaguar Land Rover business. The principal activity during the year was the design, development, manufacture and marketing of high-performance luxury saloons, specialist sports cars and
	four-wheel-drive off-road vehicles. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in Pound Sterling (GBP) and rounded to the nearest million GBP (£ million) unless otherwise stated. Results for the year ended and
	as at 31 March 2014 have been disclosed solely for the information of the users. 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE These consolidated and parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International
	Financial Reporting Standards (referred to as IFRS) and IFRS Interpretation Committee (IFRS IC) interpretations as adopted by the European Union (EU) and the requirements of the United Kingdom Companies Act 2006
	applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. In addition, these consolidated financial statements also comply with IFRS as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as no differences exist between IFRS as adopted by
	the EU applied by the Group and IFRS issued by the IASB. The Company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and, therefore, the separate financial statements of the Company do not include the income statement or the statement
	of comprehensive income of the Company on a stand-alone basis. BASIS OF PREPARATION The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair value.
	Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. GOING CONCERN The directors have considered the financial position of the Group
	at 31 March 2016 (net assets of £7,614 million (2015: £6,040 million, 2014: £5,864 million)) and the projected cash flows and financial performance of the Group for at least 12 months from the date of approval of
	these financial statements as well as planned cost and cash improvement actions, and believe that the plan for sustained profitability remains on course. The directors have taken actions to ensure that appropriate long-term cash resources are in
	place at the date of signing the accounts to fund Group operations. The directors have reviewed the financial covenants linked to the borrowings in place and believe these will not be breached at any point and that all debt repayments will be met.
	Therefore, the directors consider, after making appropriate enquiries and taking into consideration the risks and uncertainties facing the Group, that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operation as a going concern for the foreseeable
	future and is able to meet its financial covenants linked to the borrowings in place. Accordingly the directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements. BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION SUBSIDIARIES The
	consolidated financial statements include Jaguar Land Rover Automotive plc and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has power over the investee, is exposed or has rights to variable
	return from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to use its power to affect its returns. In assessing control, potential voting rights that currently are exercisable are taken into account. All subsidiaries of the Group given in
	note 42 to the parent Company financial statements are included in the consolidated financial statements. Intercompany transactions and balances including unrealised profits are eliminated in full on consolidation. ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES
	(EQUITY ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS) Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the
	investee and is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20 and 50 per cent of the voting power of another entity. Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement
	and requiring unanimous consent for decisions about the relevant activities of the entity, being those activities that significantly affect the entitys returns.

	80 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC Annual Report 201516 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES (CONTINUED) Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost. The Groups investments include goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The
	consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the income and expenses, other comprehensive income and equity movements of equity accounted investments, from the date that significant influence or joint control commences until
	the date that significant influence or joint control ceases. When the Groups share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investment, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to nil
	and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee. When the Group transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses
	are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in its associate or joint venture. USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
	It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the
	consolidated financial statements are as follows: (i) Note 16  Property, plant and equipment  the Group applies judgement in determining the estimate useful life of assets. (ii) Note 17  Intangible assets 
	management applies significant judgement in establishing the applicable criteria for capitalisation of appropriate product development costs and impairment of indefinite life intangible assets. The key judgements in the impairment assessment include
	the determination of cash-generating units, value of cash flows and appropriateness of discount rates. (iii) Note 19  Deferred tax  management applies judgement in establishing the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets
	relating to historic losses, assessing the recoverability of those assets and estimating taxes ultimately payable on remittance of overseas earnings. (iv) Note 26  Provision for product warranty  it is necessary for the Group to
	assess the provision for anticipated lifetime warranty and campaign costs. The valuation of warranty and campaign provisions requires a significant amount of judgement and the requirement to form appropriate assumptions around expected future costs.
	(v) Note 31  Retirement benefit obligation  it is necessary for actuarial assumptions to be made, including discount and mortality rates and the long-term rate of return upon scheme assets. The Group engages a qualified actuary to
	assist with determining the assumptions to be made when evaluating these liabilities. (vi) Note 34  Financial instruments  the Group enters into complex financial instruments and therefore appropriate accounting for these requires
	judgement around the valuations. REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue comprises the amounts invoiced to customers outside the Group and is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts, sales incentives, customer
	bonuses and rebates granted, which can be identified at the point of sale. Revenue is presented net of excise duty where applicable and other indirect taxes. Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been
	transferred to the customer and the amount of revenue can be reliable measured with it being probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The transfer of the significant risks and rewards is defined in the underlying agreements
	with the customer. No sale is recognised where, following disposal of significant risks and rewards, the Group retains a significant financial interest. The Groups interest in these items is retained in inventory, with a creditor being
	recognised for the contracted buy-back price. Income under such agreements, measured as the difference between the initial sale price and the buyback price, is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. The corresponding
	costs are recognised over the term of the agreement based on the difference between the items cost, including estimated costs of resale, and the expected net realisable value. If a sale includes an agreement for subsequent servicing or
	maintenance, the fair value of that service is deferred and recognised as income over the relevant service period in proportion with the expected cost pattern of the agreement.

	(CONTINUED) COST RECOGNITION Costs and expenses are recognised when incurred and are classified according to their nature. Expenditures are capitalised where appropriate in accordance with the policy for internally generated intangible assets and
	represent employee costs, stores and other manufacturing supplies, and other expenses incurred for product development undertaken by the Group. GOVERNMENT GRANTS AND INCENTIVES Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that
	the Group will comply with the relevant conditions and the grant will be received. Government grants are recognised in the consolidated income statement on a systematic basis when the Group recognises, as expenses, the related costs that the grants
	are intended to compensate. Government grants related to assets are deducted from the cost of the asset and amortised over the useful life of the asset. Government grants related to income are presented as an offset against the related expenditure
	and Government grants which are awarded as incentives with no ongoing performance obligations to the Group are recognised as other income in the period the grant is received. Sales tax incentives received from governments are recognised in the
	consolidated income statement at the reduced tax rate and revenue is reported net of these sales tax incentives. FOREIGN CURRENCY The Company has a functional currency of GBP. The presentation currency of the consolidated financial statements is
	GBP. The functional currency of the UK and non-UK selling operations is GBP being the primary economic environment that influences these operations. This is on the basis that management control is in the UK and that GBP is the currency that
	primarily determines sales prices and is the main currency for the retention of operating income. The functional currency of the Chery Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Co. Ltd., the Groups principal joint venture, is Chinese Yuan
	(CNY). The functional currency of Jaguar Land Rover Slovakia s.r.o is Euro. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and
	liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date. Exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement as Foreign exchange (loss)/gain. For the purposes
	of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations (non-GBP functional currency) are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are
	translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity. INCOME TAXES Income tax expense comprises current and deferred taxes. Income tax
	expense is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when related to items that are recognised outside of profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, whereby tax is also recognised outside of profit or
	loss), or where related to the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination. Current income taxes are determined based on respective
	taxable income of each taxable entity and tax rules applicable for respective tax jurisdictions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and
	liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business loss and depreciation carry-forwards and tax credits. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for each taxable entity and for each taxable jurisdiction.
	Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry-forwards and unused tax credits could be
	utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively
	enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same
	taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis. EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS Exceptional items by virtue of their nature, size or frequency are disclosed separately on the face of the consolidated
	income statement where this enhances understanding of the Groups performance.

	82 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC Annual Report 201516 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES (CONTINUED) PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment, if any. Cost includes purchase price, non-recoverable taxes
	and duties, labour cost and direct overheads for self-constructed assets and other direct costs incurred up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use. Interest cost incurred for constructed assets is capitalised up to the date the asset is
	ready for its intended use, based on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings, if no specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset. Depreciation is provided on a
	straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows: Class of property, plant and equipment Estimated useful life (years) Buildings 20 to 40 Plant and equipment 3 to 30 Computers 3
	to 6 Vehicles 3 to 10 Furniture and fixtures 3 to 20 Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the term of the relevant lease. Freehold land is measured at
	cost and is not depreciated. Heritage assets are not depreciated as they are considered to have a residual value in excess of cost. Residual values are re-assessed on an annual basis. Depreciation is not recorded on assets under construction until
	construction and installation is complete and the asset is ready for its intended use. Assets under construction include capital prepayments. INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets purchased, including those acquired in
	business combinations, are measured at acquisition cost which is the fair value on the date of acquisition, where applicable, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment, if any. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed
	annually to determine whether an indefinite-life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in the useful-life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis. For intangible assets with definite lives,
	amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the acquired intangible assets as per the estimated amortisation periods below: Class of intangible asset Estimated amortisation period (years) Patents and
	technological know-how 2 to 12 Customer-related  dealer network 20 Software 2 to 8 Intellectual property rights and other intangibles Indefinite life The amortisation for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at least at each
	year-end. Changes in expected useful lives are treated as changes in accounting estimates. Capital-work-in-progress includes capital advances. Customer-related intangibles acquired in a business combination consist of dealer networks. Intellectual
	property rights and other intangibles consist of brand names, which are considered to have indefinite lives due to the longevity of the brands.

	(CONTINUED) INTERNALLY GENERATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Research costs are charged to the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are incurred. Product development costs incurred on new vehicle platforms, engines, transmission and new
	products are recognised as intangible assets, when feasibility has been established, the Group has committed technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and it is probable that the asset will generate future economic
	benefits. The costs capitalised include the cost of materials, direct labour and directly attributable overhead expenditure incurred up to the date the asset is available for use. Interest cost incurred is capitalised up to the date the asset is
	ready for its intended use, based on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings if no specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset. Product development cost is amortised over
	a period of between two and ten years. Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss. Amortisation is not recorded on product development in progress until development is
	complete. IMPAIRMENT PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that any property, plant and equipment and intangible assets may be impaired. If any such
	impairment indicator exists the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to determine the extent of impairment, if any. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount
	of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, or earlier, if there is an indication that the asset may be
	impaired. The estimated recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
	reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to
	be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. An annual impairment review for
	heritage assets is performed and any impairment in the carrying value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. EQUITY ACCOUNTED INVESTMENTS: JOINT VENTURES AND ASSOCIATES The requirements of IAS 39 Financial Instruments:
	Recognition and Measurement are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the Groups investment in an associate or joint venture. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment
	(including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (the higher of value in use and fair value less costs of disposal) with its carrying amount. Any
	impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases. CASH AND
	CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of up to three months that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to
	insignificant risk of changes in value. INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of raw materials and consumables are ascertained on a first-in, first-out basis. Costs, including fixed and variable
	production overheads, are allocated to work-in-progress and finished goods determined on a full absorption cost basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated cost of completion and
	selling expenses. Inventories include vehicles sold subject to repurchase arrangements. These vehicles are carried at cost to the Group and are amortised in changes in stocks and work-in-progress to their residual values (i.e. estimated second-hand
	sale value) over the term of the arrangement.

	POLICIES (CONTINUED) PROVISIONS A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be
	required to settle the obligation. Provisions are held for product warranties, legal and product liabilities, residual risks and environmental risks as detailed in note 26 to the consolidated financial statements. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
	(LTIP) The Group operates a LTIP arrangement for certain employees. The scheme provides a cash payment to the employee based on a specific number of phantom shares at grant date and the share price of Tata Motors Limited at the vesting
	date, subject to profitability and employment conditions. These are accounted for as cash-settled arrangements, whereby a liability is recognised at fair value at the date of grant, using a Black-Scholes model. At each balance sheet date until the
	liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is remeasured, with any changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement. LEASES At the inception of a lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or
	an operating lease, based on the terms and substance of the lease arrangement. ASSETS TAKEN ON FINANCE LEASE A finance lease is recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and
	the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalised and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease
	payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each year during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest
	on the remaining balance of the liability. ASSETS TAKEN ON OPERATING LEASE Leases other than finance leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Groups balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are
	recognised in the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease in Other expenses. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PENSION PLANS The Group operates several defined benefit pension plans, which were previously
	contracted out of the second state pension scheme until 5 April 2016. The assets of the plans are held in separate trustee administered funds. The plans provide for monthly pension after retirement based on salary and service as set out in the
	rules of each plan. Contributions to the plans by the Group take into consideration the results of actuarial valuations. The plans with a surplus position at the balance sheet date have been limited to the maximum economic benefit available from
	unconditional rights to refund from the scheme or reduction in future contributions. Where the subsidiary group is considered to have a contractual obligation to fund the pension plan above the accounting value of the liabilities, an onerous
	obligation is recognised. The UK defined benefit schemes were closed to new joiners in April 2010. For defined benefit retirement benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial
	valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest) are recognised immediately in the balance
	sheet with a charge or credit to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. Remeasurement recorded in the statement of comprehensive income is not recycled. Past service cost, including curtailment gains
	and losses, is generally recognised in profit or loss in the period of scheme amendment. Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net defined benefit liability.

	Overview Strategic report Governance Financial statements IFC19 2059 6071 72IBC 85 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
	(CONTINUED) Defined benefit costs are split into three categories:  Current service cost, past service cost and gains and losses on curtailments and settlements;  Net interest cost; and  Remeasurement. The Group presents these
	defined benefit costs within Employee costs in the consolidated income statement (see note 6). A separate defined contribution plan is available to new employees of Jaguar Land Rover. Costs in respect of this plan are charged to the
	consolidated income statement as incurred. POST-RETIREMENT MEDICARE SCHEME Under this unfunded scheme, employees of some subsidiaries receive medical benefits subject to certain limits of amount, periods after retirement and types of benefits,
	depending on their grade and location at the time of retirement. Employees separated from the Group as part of an Early Separation Scheme, on medical grounds or due to permanent disablement are also covered under the scheme. The applicable
	subsidiaries account for the liability for the post-retirement medical scheme based on an annual actuarial valuation. ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES Actuarial gains and losses relating to retirement benefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive
	income in the year in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses relating to long-term employee benefits are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year in which they arise. MEASUREMENT DATE The measurement date of all retirement
	plans is 31 March. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CLASSIFICATION, INITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.
	Financial assets are classified into categories: financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (which can either be held for trading or designated as fair value options), held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables and
	available-for-sale financial assets. Financial liabilities are classified into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and other financial liabilities. No financial instruments have been designated as fair value through profit or
	loss using the fair value option or have been classified as held-to-maturity. Financial instruments are recognised on the balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Initially, a financial instrument
	is recognised at its fair value. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial instruments are recognised in determining the carrying amount, if it is not classified as at fair value through profit or loss.
	Subsequently, financial instruments are measured according to the category in which they are classified. Financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss  held for trading: Derivatives, including embedded
	derivatives separated from the host contract, are classified into this category. Financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated income statement with the exception of those
	derivatives which are designated as cash flow hedging instruments and for which hedge accounting is applied. Loans and receivables: Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
	an active market and which are not classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss or financial assets available-for-sale. Subsequently, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment
	losses. These include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, finance receivables and other financial assets. Available-for-sale financial assets: Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial assets that are either
	designated as such upon initial recognition or are not classified in any of the other financial assets categories. Subsequently, these are measured at fair value and changes therein are recognised in other comprehensive income, net of applicable
	deferred income taxes, and accumulated in the investments revaluation reserve with the exception of impairment losses, interest calculated using the effective interest method and foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets, which are
	recognised directly in profit or loss. The Group does not hold any available-for-sale financial assets. Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured,
	are measured at cost. Embedded derivatives relating to prepayment options on Senior Notes are not considered as closely related and are separately accounted unless the exercise price of these options is approximately equal on each exercise date to
	the amortised cost of the Senior Notes. EQUITY INSTRUMENTS An equity instrument is any contract that evidences residual interests in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded
	at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.

	POLICIES (CONTINUED) OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES These are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
	an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group
	takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group
	determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments.
	Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow method and other valuation models. DERECOGNITION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the
	asset expires or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues
	to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred
	financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received. Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, that is when the obligation is
	discharged, cancelled or has expired. When a financial instrument is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss in equity (if any) is transferred to the consolidated income statement. IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS The Group assesses at each balance
	sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, or a group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates
	that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. Loans and receivables: Objective evidence of impairment includes default in payments with respect to amounts receivable from customers, significant
	financial difficulty of the customer or bankruptcy. Impairment loss in respect of loans and receivables is calculated as the difference between their carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original
	effective interest rate. Such impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. If the amount of an impairment loss decreases in a subsequent year, and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
	impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed. The reversal is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Equity investments: A significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its
	cost is also evidence that the assets are impaired. If any such evidence exists the cumulative loss, measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously
	recognised in profit or loss is removed from equity and recognised in profit and loss. Impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement on equity instruments are not reversed through the consolidated income statement. HEDGE
	ACCOUNTING The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The Group designates these forward contracts and options in
	a cash flow hedging relationships by applying hedge accounting principles under IAS 39. These forward contracts and options are stated at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet at each reporting date. Changes in the fair value of these forward
	contracts and options that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised in other comprehensive income (net of tax), and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Amounts
	accumulated in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the consolidated income statement in the periods in which the forecasted transactions affect profit or loss. For options, the time value is not a designated component of the hedge, and
	therefore all changes in fair value related to the time value of the instrument are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised,
	or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained there until the forecast transaction affects profit or loss. If the
	forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the consolidated income statement.

	(CONTINUED) NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THE GROUP ADOPTED THE FOLLOWING STANDARDS, REVISIONS AND AMENDMENTS TO STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS: IAS 19 Employee Benefits was amended in November 2013 to clarify the requirements
	that relate to how contributions from employees or third parties that are linked to service should be attributed to periods of service. In addition, it permits a practical expedient if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of
	years of service, in that contributions, can, but are not required, to be recognised as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the related service is rendered. The amendment did not have a material impact on the consolidated
	financial statements. THE FOLLOWING PRONOUNCEMENTS, ISSUED BY THE IASB AND ENDORSED BY THE EU, ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED BY THE GROUP. THE GROUP IS EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THESE PRONOUNCEMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
	STATEMENTS: IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment has been amended to prohibit entities from using a revenue based depreciation method for items of property, plant and equipment. IAS 38 introduces a rebuttable presumption that revenue is not an
	appropriate basis for amortising intangible assets. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. These amendments do not have any impact on the consolidated financial
	statements. IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements addresses how a joint operator should account for the interest in a joint operation in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning
	on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. The amendment does not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment has been amended to include bearer plants whilst the
	produce growing on bearer plants remains within the scope of IAS 41. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2016, with early adoption permitted. The amendment does not have any impact on the consolidated
	financial statements. IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements has been amended to support preparers in exercising their judgement in presenting their financial reports. This includes clarification that all information should have materiality
	considerations applied and additional examples on expected presentation of the financial statements. The amendment does not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements based upon the current disclosures given. IAS 27 Separate Financial
	Statements has been amended to permit investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates to be optionally accounted for using the equity method in separate financial statements. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or
	after 1 January 2016 with early adoption permitted. This amendment does not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. In addition, as part of the IASBs Annual Improvements, a number of minor amendments have been made to
	standards in the 20122014 cycles. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2016, with early application permitted. These amendments do not have a material impact on the consolidated financial
	statements. THE FOLLOWING PRONOUNCEMENTS, ISSUED BY THE IASB, HAVE NOT YET BEEN ENDORSED BY THE EU, ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADOPTED BY THE GROUP. THE GROUP IS EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THESE PRONOUNCEMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED
	FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: IFRS 10 and IAS 28 have been amended to clarify the treatment of the transfer of assets or sale of equity from an investor to its associate or joint venture. The mandatory effective date for these amendments has been deferred
	indefinitely by the IASB. These amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. IFRS 14 permits an entity which is a first-time adopter of International Financial Reporting Standards to continue to
	account, with some limited changes, for regulatory deferral account balances in accordance with its previous GAAP, both on initial adoption of IFRS and in subsequent financial statements. This standard is effective for annual periods
	beginning on or after January 2016 subject to EU endorsement. The amendment does not have any impact the consolidated financial statements. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers deals with revenue recognition and establishes principles for
	reporting useful information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entitys contracts with customers. Revenue is recognised when a customer obtains control of
	a good or service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the benefits from the good or service. The standard replaces IAS 18 Revenue and IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. The standard is effective for annual
	periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 15 and expects it to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.

	88 JAGUAR LAND ROVER AUTOMOTIVE PLC Annual Report 201516 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 2 ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES (CONTINUED) IFRS 9 Financial Instruments addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. The complete version of IFRS 9 was issued in July 2014. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39
	that relates to the classification and measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortised cost, fair value through
	other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss. The basis of classification depends on the entitys business model and contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are
	required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss
	model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit
	or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument and for the hedged ratio to
	be the same as the one management actually use for the risk management process. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or
	after 1 January 2018 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 9 and expects it to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. The amendments to IFRS 10
	Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures (2011) relate to investment entities. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or
	after 1 January 2016 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement. JLR, its subsidiaries and its parent do not meet the definition of an investment entity and therefore the amendment is not applicable. IFRS 16
	specifies how an IFRS reporter will recognise, measure, present and disclose leases. The standard provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases unless the lease term is 12 months or
	less or the underlying asset has a low value. Lessors continue to classify leases as operating or finance, with IFRS 16s approach to lessor accounting substantially unchanged from its predecessor, IAS 17. The standard is effective for annual
	periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement and the adoption of IFRS 15. The Group is assessing the impact of IFRS 16 and expects it to have a significant impact on the
	consolidated financial statements. IAS 12 Income taxes has been amended to clarify the treatment of deferred tax on debt held at fair value and clarify details on recognition of deferred tax assets. The amendment is effective for annual periods
	beginning on or after 1 January 2017, with early adoption permitted. These amendments do not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements. IAS 7 has been amended to require additional disclosure to help users evaluate changes in
	borrowings. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and earlier application is permitted subject to EU endorsement. The Group expects to include a net debt reconciliation within its disclosures
	following the adoption of this standard. 3 EXCEPTIONAL ITEM The exceptional item of £157 million for the year ended 31 March 2016 relates to the full financial year impact of the explosion at the port of Tianjin (China) in August
	2015. A provision of £245 million against the carrying value of inventory (finished goods) was recorded in the second quarter ended 30 September 2015, based on the Groups assessment of the physical condition of the vehicles
	involved. Subsequent to that, insurance proceeds of £55 million have been received, together with the conclusion of further assessments of the condition of the remaining vehicles, which had led to a reversal of £33 million of
	the initial provision. The process for finalising ongoing insurance claims may take some months to conclude, so further insurance and other potential recoveries will only be recognised in future periods when received or confirmed as receivable. Due
	to the size of the provision recorded, the charge together with the associated tax impact has been disclosed as an exceptional item. Any future recoveries will similarly be recognised as a reversal of that charge through exceptional items.

	INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) The Group operates a LTIP arrangement for certain employees. The scheme provides a cash payment to the employee based on a specific number of phantom shares at grant date and the share price of Tata Motors Limited
	at the vesting date. The cash payment is dependent upon continued employment for the duration of the three year vesting period. The cash payment has no exercise price and therefore the weighted average exercise price in all cases is £nil. Year

	£4.45) . The weighted average remaining contractual life of the outstanding awards is 1.4 years (2015: 1.3 years, 2014: 1.3 years). The amount charged in the year in relation to the long-term incentive plan was £3 million (2015:
	£16 million, 2014: £11 million). The fair value of the balance sheet liability in respect of phantom stock awards outstanding at the year-end was £16 million (2015: £23 million, 2014: £17 million). The
	fair value of the awards was calculated using a Black-Scholes model at the grant date. The fair value is updated at each reporting date as the awards are accounted for as cash-settled under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. The inputs into the model are
	based on the Tata Motors Limited historic data and the risk-free rate is calculated on government bond rates. The inputs used are: As at 31 March 2016 2015 2014 Risk-free rate (%) 0.51 0.49 0.91 Dividend yield (%) 0.00 0.39 0.49

	INTANGIBLE ASSETS (CONTINUED)



	IMPAIRMENT TESTING



	The directors are of the
	view that the operations of the Group represent a single cash-generating unit. The intellectual property rights are deemed to have an indefinite useful life on the basis of the expected longevity of the brand names. For the periods presented, the
	recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit has been calculated with reference to its value in use. The key assumptions of this calculation are shown below:



	As
	at 31 March 2016 2015 2014



	Period on which management approved forecasts are based 5 years 5 years 5 years



	Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 2.1% 2.2% 0%



	Pre-tax discount rate 11.2%
	11.2% 10.9%



	The growth rates used in the value in use calculation reflect those inherent within the Boards latest business plan which is primarily a function
	of the Groups cycle plan assumptions, past performance and managements expectation of future market developments, through to 2021/22. The cash flows are then extrapolated into perpetuity assuming a growth rate of 2.1 per cent (2015:
	2.2 per cent, 2014: nil per cent).



	No reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying
	value of the assets of the cash-generating unit.

	PRODUCT WARRANTY PROVISION



	The Group offers warranty cover in respect of manufacturing defects, which become apparent up to five years after purchase, dependent on the market in which the purchase occurred.
	The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible
	future incidences based on actions on product failures. The discount on the warranty provision is calculated using a risk-free discount rate as the risks specific to the liability, such as infiation, are included in the base calculation. The timing
	of outfiows will vary as and when a warranty claim will arise, being typically up to five years.



	LEGAL AND PRODUCT LIABILITY PROVISION



	A legal and product liability provision is maintained in respect of compliance with regulations and known litigations which impact the Group. The provision primarily relates to
	motor accident claims, consumer complaints, dealer terminations, employment cases, personal injury claims and compliance with regulations.



	RESIDUAL RISK PROVISION



	In certain markets, the Group is responsible for the residual risk arising on vehicles sold by dealers on leasing arrangements. The provision is based on the
	latest available market expectations of future residual value trends. The timing of the outflows will be at the end of the lease arrangements  being typically up to three years.



	ENVIRONMENTAL RISK PROVISION



	This provision relates to various environmental remediation costs
	such as asbestos removal and land clean up. The timing of when these costs will be incurred is not known with certainty.

	31 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS



	The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of certain of its subsidiaries. The UK defined benefit schemes are administered by a trustee that is legally
	separated from the Company. The trustee of the pension schemes is required by law to act in the interest of the fund and of all relevant stakeholders in the schemes, is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the schemes
	and all other governance matters. The board of the trustee must be composed of representatives of the Company and scheme participants in accordance with each schemes regulations. Under the schemes, the employees are entitled to post-retirement
	benefits based on their length of service and salary. Through its defined benefit pension schemes the Group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are detailed below:



	ASSET VOLATILITY



	The scheme liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with
	reference to corporate bond yields; if scheme assets under perform these corporate bonds, this will create or increase a deficit. The defined benefit schemes hold a significant proportion of equity type assets, which are expected to outperform
	corporate bonds in the long term although introducing volatility and risk in the short term.



	As the schemes mature, the Group intends to reduce the level of
	investment risk by investing more in assets that better match the liabilities.



	However, the Group believes that due to the long-term nature of the scheme
	liabilities and the strength of the supporting group, a level of continuing equity type investments is an appropriate element of the Groups long-term strategy to manage the schemes efficiently.



	CHANGES IN BOND YIELDS



	A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities,
	although this is expected to be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes bond holdings and interest rate hedging instruments.



	INFLATION
	RISK



	Some of the Group pension obligations are linked to infiation, and higher infiation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the
	level of infiationary increases are in place to protect the scheme against extreme infiation). The schemes hold a significant proportion of assets in index linked gilts, together with other infiation hedging instruments and also assets which are
	more loosely correlated with infiation. However, an increase in infiation will also increase the deficit to some degree.



	LIFE EXPECTANCY



	The majority of the schemes obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the schemes
	liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK defined benefit schemes, where inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.

	31 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS (CONTINUED)



	The most recent actuarial valuations of scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit liability for accounting purposes were carried out at 31 March 2016 by a
	qualified independent actuary. The present value of the defined benefit liability, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit credit method.



	The principal assumptions used in accounting for the pension schemes are set out below:



	2016
	2015 2014



	Year ended 31 March%%%



	Discount rate 3.6 3.4 4.6



	Expected rate of increase in compensation level of covered employees 3.5 3.6 3.9



	Infiation
	increase 3.0 3.1 3.4



	For the valuation at 31 March 2016, the mortality assumptions used are the SAPS base table, in particular S2NxA tables and the Light
	table for members of the Jaguar Executive Pension Plan. A scaling factor of 120 per cent for males and 110 per cent for females has been used for the Jaguar Pension Plan, 115 per cent for males and 105 per cent for females for
	the Land Rover Pension Scheme, and 95 per cent for males and 85 per cent for females for Jaguar Executive Pension Plan.



	For the valuation at
	31 March 2015 and 2014, the mortality assumptions used are the SAPS base table, in particular S1NxA tables and the Light table for members of the Jaguar Executive Pension Plan. A scaling factor of 115 per cent has been used for the Jaguar
	Pension Plan, 110 per cent for the Land Rover Pension Scheme, and 105 per cent for males and 90 per cent for females for Jaguar Executive Pension Plan.



	There is an allowance for future improvements in line with the CMI (2014) projections (2015: CMI (2014) projections, 2014: CMI (2013) projections) and an allowance
	for long-term improvements of 1.25 per cent per annum.



	The assumed life expectations on retirement at age 65 are:



	2016 2015 2014



	As at 31 March years years years



	Retiring today:



	Males 21.5 21.4 20.0



	Females 24.4 23.9 24.5



	Retiring in 20 years:



	Males 23.2 23.1 23.8



	Females 26.2 25.8 26.4



	The sensitivity analyses below are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of
	the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit
	method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position.



	The
	methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared to previous periods.

	scheme liabilities Impact on service cost

	As at 31 March 2016 the schemes held Gilt Repos, the net value of these transactions is included in the value of Interest Rate and
	Inflation derivatives. The value of the funding obligation for the Repo transactions is £373 million at 31 March 2016. The schemes did not have any Gilt Repos at 31 March 2015 or 31 March 2014.



	The split of level 1 assets is 63 per cent (2015: 59 per cent, 2014: 79 per cent), level 2 assets 31 per cent (2015: 37 per cent, 2014: 20 per cent)

	JLR has agreed updated contributions towards the UK defined benefit schemes
	following the 5 April 2015 valuation. It is intended to eliminate the pension scheme funding deficits over the 10 years following the valuation date. The current agreed contribution rate for defined benefit accrual is 31% of pensionable
	salaries in the UK. Deficit contribution levels remain in line with prior expectation for 2016-18 and then increase to £58 million per annum to March 2025.



	The average duration of the benefit obligation at 31 March 2016 is 20.5 years (2015: 23.5 years, 2014: 22.5 years). The expected net periodic pension cost for the year ended
	31 March 2017 is £224 million. In addition to advanced contributions of £69 million paid in March 2016 the group expects to pay £219 million to its defined benefit schemes in the year ended 31 March 2017.



	DEFINED CONTRIBUTION FUND



	The Groups contribution to defined
	contribution plans for the year ended 31 March 2016 was £47 million (2015: £33 million, 2014: £23 million).

	32 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



	In the normal course of business, the Group faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Group assesses such claims and assertions and monitors the legal environment on an
	ongoing basis, with the assistance of external legal counsel wherever necessary. The Group records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable of being estimated and discloses such matters in its financial statements,
	if material. For potential losses that are considered possible, but not probable, the Group provides disclosure in the financial statements but does not record a liability in its accounts unless the loss becomes probable. Such potential losses may
	be of an uncertain timing and/or amount.



	The following is a description of claims and contingencies where a potential loss is possible, but not probable.



	Management believes that none of the contingencies described below, either individually or in aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Groups
	financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



	LITIGATION AND PRODUCT RELATED MATTERS



	The Group is involved in legal proceedings, both as plaintiff and as defendant. There are claims and potential claims as at



	31 March 2016 of £6 million (2015: £11 million, 2014: £27 million) against the Group which management has not recognised as they are not considered
	probable. These claims and potential claims pertain to motor accident claims, consumer complaints, employment and dealership arrangements, replacement of parts of vehicles and/or compensation for deficiency in the services by the Group or its
	dealers.



	As disclosed in note 41 (Subsequent events), the Group has provided for the estimated costs of repair following the passenger safety airbag issue in the
	United States. The Group recognises that there is a potential risk of further recalls in other countries in the future, however, the Group are unable at this point in time to reliably estimate the amount and timings of any potential future costs
	associated with this warranty issue.



	OTHER TAXES AND DUES



	During the year
	ended 31 March 2015 the Groups Brazilian subsidiary has received a demand for 167 million Brazilian Real



	(£32 million at 31 March 2016
	exchange rates) in relation to additional indirect taxes (PIS and COFINS) claimed as being due on local vehicle and parts sales made in 2010. The matter is currently being contested before the Brazilian appellate authorities. Professional legal
	opinions obtained in Brazil fully support that the basis of the tax authoritys assertion is incorrect and, as a result, the likelihood of any settlement ultimately having to be made is considered remote. Accordingly no provision has been
	recognised in the financial statements and the matter is disclosed here purely for the purposes of completeness.



	The Group had no other significant tax matters in
	dispute as at 31 March 2016, 2015 or 2014 where a potential loss was considered possible.



	COMMITMENTS



	The Group has entered into various contracts with vendors and contractors for the acquisition of plant and machinery, equipment and various civil contracts of capital nature
	aggregating to £797 million (2015: £814 million, 2014: £940 million) and £12 million (2015: £nil, 2014: £nil) relating to the acquisition of intangible assets.



	The Group has entered into various contracts with vendors and contractors which include obligations aggregating to £1,836 million (2015: £642 million, 2014:
	£717 million) to purchase minimum or fixed quantities of material and other procurement commitments.



	Commitments and contingencies also includes other
	contingent liabilities of £28 million (2015: £2 million, 2014: £nil). Inventory of £nil (2015: £nil, 2014: £nil) and trade receivables with a carrying amount of £116 million (2015:
	£156 million, 2014: £167 million) and property, plant and equipment with a carrying amount of £nil (2015: £nil, 2014: £nil) and restricted cash with a carrying amount of £nil (2015: £nil, 2014:
	£nil) are pledged as collateral/security against the borrowings and commitments.



	There are guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business of
	£nil (2015: £nil, 2014: £nil).



	Commitments related to leases are set out in note 35.



	Stipulated within the joint venture agreement for Chery Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Co. Ltd. is a commitment for the Group to contribute a total of CNY 3,500 million of
	capital, of which CNY 2,875 million has been contributed as at 31 March 2016. The outstanding commitment of CNY 625 million translates to £67 million at 31 March 2016 exchange rate.

	CAPITAL MANAGEMENT



	The Groups objectives when managing capital are to ensure the going concern operation of its entities and to maintain an efficient capital
	structure to reduce the cost of capital, support the corporate strategy and to meet shareholder expectations. The Groups policy is to borrow primarily through capital market debt issues to meet anticipated funding requirements and maintain
	sufficient liquidity. The Group also maintains certain undrawn committed credit facilities to provide additional liquidity. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity to certain
	subsidiaries as required. Surplus cash in subsidiaries is pooled (where practicable) and invested to satisfy security, liquidity and yield requirements.



	The
	capital structure is governed according to Group policies approved by the Board and is monitored by various metrics such as interest cover, as per the debt covenants.



	Funding requirements are reviewed periodically with any debt issuances and capital distributions approved by the Board.



	The following table summarises the capital of the Group:

	OFFSETTING



	Certain financial assets and
	financial liabilities are subject to offsetting where there is currently a legally enforceable right to set off recognised amounts and the Group intends to either settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability
	simultaneously.



	Derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are subject to master netting arrangements whereby in the case of insolvency, derivative
	financial assets and financial liabilities can be settled on a net basis.

	34 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)



	FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY



	Financial instruments held at fair value are required to
	be measured by reference to the following levels.



	Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of hierarchy includes financial instruments that are
	measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;



	Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2):
	This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived
	from prices);



	Valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using
	inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions
	in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.



	There has been no change in the valuation techniques adopted or any transfers between fair
	value levels.



	The financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, as
	defined by IFRS 13, being those derived from inputs other than quoted prices that are observable. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific
	estimates. Fair value of forward derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash fiows using prevailing market interest rate curves from Reuters. Commodity swap contracts are similarly fair
	valued by discounting expected future contractual cash fiows. Option contracts on foreign currency are entered into on a zero cost collar basis and fair value estimates are calculated from standard Black-Scholes options pricing methodology, using
	prevailing market interest rates and volatilities.



	Additionally, a Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA)/Debit Value Adjustment (DVA) is taken on derivative financial
	assets and liabilities and is calculated by discounting the fair value gain or loss on the financial derivative using credit default swap (CDS) prices quoted for the counterparty or Jaguar Land Rover respectively. CDS prices are obtained from
	Bloomberg.



	The long-term unsecured listed bonds are held at amortised cost. Their fair value for disclosure purposes is determined using Level 1 valuation
	techniques, based on the closing price at 31 March 2016 on the EURO MTF market.



	Fair values of cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, trade
	receivables and payables, short-term borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities (current and non-current excluding derivatives) are assumed to approximate to cost due to the short-term maturity of the instruments and as the impact of
	discounting is not significant.



	Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments. However, there are inherent
	limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Group could have realised in a sales transaction as
	of respective dates. The estimated fair value amounts as of 31 March 2016, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014 have been measured as of the respective dates. As such, the fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the
	respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.



	(B) FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT



	As discussed in the Strategic report under the section Our Risks, the Group is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price, interest rate, liquidity and credit
	risks. The Group has a risk management framework in place which monitors all of these risks.



	(C) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK



	The fiuctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have a potential impact on the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the
	consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash fiow statement where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/ liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the
	functional currency of the respective consolidated entities.



	Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Group operates, its operations are
	subject to risks arising from fiuctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily relate to fiuctuations in US Dollar, Chinese Yuan and Euro against the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries.

	201516



	NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED



	34
	FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)



	i) HEDGE ACCOUNTING EXPOSURES



	The Group
	uses foreign currency contracts to hedge its risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to highly probable forecast transactions. The fair value of such contracts designated in the hedge relationship as of 31 March 2016 was a
	net liability of £1,118 million (2015: net liability of £1,263 million, 2014: net asset of £673 million).



	Cash fiow hedges are expected
	to be recognised in profit or loss during the years ending 31 March 2017 to 2021. The Group also has a number of foreign currency options which are entered into as an economic hedge of the financial risks of the Group. The time value of options
	is excluded from the hedge relationship and thus the change in time value is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.



	Changes in the fair value
	of foreign currency contracts, to the extent determined to be an effective hedge, are recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion of the fair value change is recognised in the income statement. Accordingly,
	the fair value change of net loss of £169 million (2015: loss of £1,768 million, 2014: gain of £1,041 million) was recognised in other comprehensive income. The loss due to hedge ineffectiveness where forecast
	transactions are no longer expected to occur was £2 million (2015: loss of £5 million, 2014: gain of £5 million) which has been recognised in Foreign exchange (loss)/gain in the consolidated income statement.
	The gain on derivative contracts not eligible for hedging was £88 million (2015: loss of £161 million, 2014: gain of £57 million) which has been recognised in Foreign exchange (loss)/gain in the consolidated
	income statement.



	A 10 per cent depreciation/appreciation of the foreign currency underlying such contracts would have resulted in an approximate additional
	(loss)/gain of (£1,824) million/£1,690 million (2015: £1,251 million/(£1,382) million, 2014: £734 million/(£893) million) in equity and a gain/(loss) of £60 million/£54 million (2015: £165
	million/(£91) million, 2014: £51 million/(£31) million) in the consolidated income statement.



	In addition to using derivative contracts to
	economically hedge future purchases in US Dollars, the Group issues bonds denominated in US Dollars to give a degree of natural hedging of future sales revenues. ii) BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES



	The Group is also exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates which impact the valuation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of its national sales companies and
	also foreign currency denominated balances on all Groups balance sheet at each reporting period end.



	The following table sets forth information relating to
	foreign currency exposure as of 31 March 2016:

	increase/decrease in the Groups net profit before tax and total equity by approximately £113 million, £13 million and £103 million respectively for the year ended 31 March 2014.



	* Others include Japanese Yen, Russian Rouble, Singapore Dollar, Swiss Franc, Australian Dollar, South African Rand, Thai Baht, Korean Won etc.

	34 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)



	(D) COMMODITY PRICE RISK



	The Group is exposed to commodity price risk arising
	from the purchase of certain raw materials such as aluminium, copper, platinum and palladium. This risk is mitigated through the use of derivative contracts and fixed price contracts with suppliers. The derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge
	accounting as the commodity exposure does not meet the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39.



	The total fair value loss on commodities of £113 million
	(2015: loss of £38 million, 2014: loss of £18 million) has been recognised in other income in the consolidated income statement. The losses reported do not reflect the purchasing benefits received by the Group which are included
	within material and other cost of sales.



	A 10 per cent appreciation/depreciation of all commodity prices underlying such contracts would have resulted in a
	gain/(loss) of £52 million (2015: £52 million, 2014: £36 million).



	(E) INTEREST RATE RISK



	Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will lead to changes in interest income and expense for the Group.



	In addition to issuing long-term fixed-rate bonds, the Group has other facilities in place which are primarily used to finance working capital that are subject to variable interest
	rates. When undertaking a new debt issuance the Board will consider the fixed/fioating interest rate mix of the Group, the outlook for future interest rates and the appetite for certainty of funding costs.



	The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at the balance
	sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The year-end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year.



	As of 31 March 2016 net financial liabilities of £116 million (2015: £156 million, 2014: £167 million) were subject to the variable interest rate.
	An increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would result in an impact of £1 million (2015: £2 million, 2014: £2 million) in the consolidated income statement and £nil (2015,
	2014: £nil) in equity.



	(F) LIQUIDITY RISK



	Liquidity risk is the risk
	that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.



	The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to maintain sufficient liquidity
	in the form of cash and undrawn borrowing facilities to meet the Groups operating requirements with an appropriate level of headroom.



	The following are the
	undiscounted contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments:

	(G) CREDIT RISK



	The majority of the Groups credit risk pertains to the risk of financial loss arising from counterparty default on cash investments. All Group cash is invested according to
	strict credit criteria and actively monitored by Group Treasury in conjunction with the current market valuation of derivative contracts. To support this, the Board has implemented an investment policy which places limits on the maximum cash
	investment that can be made with any single counterparty depending on their published external credit rating.



	To a lesser extent the Group has an exposure to
	counterparties on trade receivables. The Group will seek to mitigate credit risk on sales to third parties through the use of payment at the point of delivery, credit insurance and letters of credit from banks which meet internal rating criteria.



	None of the financial instruments of the Group result in material concentrations of credit risks.



	EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK



	The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit
	exposure.



	FINANCIAL ASSETS



	None of the Groups cash equivalents,
	including term deposits with banks, are past due or impaired. Regarding other financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired, there were no indications as at 31 March 2016 (2015, 2014: no indications) that defaults in payment
	obligations will occur.



	Trade and other receivables past due and impaired are set out below:

	liability of £116 million (2015: £156 million, 2014: £167 million) is in short-term borrowings. Both the asset and associated liability are stated at fair value.

	Proposed dividend for the year of £0.10 (2015: £0.10, 2014: £0.10) per ordinary

	In May 2016, the Company proposed an ordinary dividend of
	£150 million to its immediate parent TML Holdings Pte. Ltd. (Singapore). This amount was paid in full in June 2016.



	During the year ended 31 March
	2016, the Company identified that, whilst the Company had profits available to pay the dividends, prior to the approval of distributions made in respect of the financial years ended 31 March 2012  31 March 2015, the Company did not
	comply with the requirement under section 836 and 838 of the Companies Act 2006 to deliver interim accounts to the registrar of companies. Corrective action was taken in March 2016 to regularise matters by ratifying the distribution made for each of
	the respective years and releasing the Company and the directors from any liabilities connected with those distributions.



	51 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



	The Company does not have any commitments or contingencies at 31 March 2016, 2015 or 2014.



	52 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT



	The Companys objectives when managing capital are to ensure the
	going concern operation of its subsidiary undertakings and to maintain an efficient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital, support the corporate strategy and to meet shareholder expectations.



	The Companys policy is to borrow primarily through capital market debt issues to meet anticipated funding requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. The Company also
	maintains certain undrawn committed credit facilities to provide additional liquidity. These borrowings, together with cash generated from operations, are loaned internally or contributed as equity to certain subsidiaries as required. Surplus cash
	in subsidiaries is pooled (where practicable) and invested to satisfy security, liquidity and yield requirements.

	Total
	financial liabilities 1,871  1,871 2,010



	FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY



	Financial
	instruments held at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels.



	Quoted prices in an active market (Level 1): This level of
	hierarchy includes financial instruments that are measured by reference to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;



	Valuation techniques with observable inputs (Level 2): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs other than quoted
	prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices);



	Valuation
	techniques with significant unobservable inputs (Level 3): This level of hierarchy includes financial assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Fair values are determined in
	whole or in part using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.



	The long-term unsecured listed bonds are held at amortised cost. Their fair value (disclosed above) is determined using Level 1 valuation techniques, based on the closing price at
	31 March 2016 on the EURO MTF market. There has been no change in the valuation techniques adopted or any transfers between fair value levels.



	Fair values of
	cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, trade receivables and payables, short-term borrowings and other financial assets and liabilities (current and non-current excluding derivatives) are assumed to approximate to cost due to the
	short-term maturing of the instruments and as the impact of discounting is not significant.

	53 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)



	Management uses its best judgement in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments. However, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique.
	Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Company could have realised in a sales transaction as of respective dates. The estimated fair
	value amounts as of 31 March 2016, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014 have been measured as of the respective dates. As such, the fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different
	than the amounts reported at each year-end.



	(B) FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT



	As
	discussed in the Strategic report under the section Our risks, the Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, commodity price, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks. The Company has a risk management framework in place which monitors
	all of these risks.



	(C) FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK



	The fluctuation
	in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the income statement and statement of changes in equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a currency
	other than the functional currency of the Company.



	As at 31 March 2016, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014, there are no designated cash flow hedges.



	The Companys operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates. The risks primarily relate to fluctuations in the GBP:US Dollar
	rate as the Company has US Dollar assets and liabilities and a GBP functional currency. The following analysis has been calculated based on the gross exposure as of the balance sheet date which could affect the income statement.



	The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure as at 31 March 2016:



	US Dollar



	£m



	Financial assets 1,610



	Financial liabilities(1,609)



	Net exposure asset 1



	A 10 per cent appreciation/depreciation of the US Dollar would
	result in an increase/decrease in the Companys net profit before tax and net assets by approximately £nil.



	The following table sets forth information
	relating to foreign currency exposure as at 31 March 2015:



	US Dollar



	£m



	Financial assets 1,565



	Financial liabilities(1,564)



	Net exposure asset 1



	A 10 per cent appreciation/depreciation of the US Dollar would result in an increase/decrease in the Companys net profit before tax and net assets by approximately
	£nil.



	The following table sets forth information relating to foreign currency exposure as at 31 March 2014:



	US Dollar



	£m



	Financial assets 1,078



	Financial liabilities(1,066)



	Net exposure asset 12



	A 10 per cent appreciation/depreciation of the US Dollar would
	result in an increase/decrease in the Companys net profit before tax and net assets by approximately £1 million.

	NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	CONTINUED



	53 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)



	(D) INTEREST RATE RISK



	Interest rate risk is measured by using the cash flow sensitivity for changes in variable interest rates.



	The Company is presently funded with long-term fixed interest rate bonds. The Company is subject to variable interest rates on certain other debt obligations.



	As of 31 March 2016 net financial assets of £34 million (2015: £34 million, 2014: £25 million) were subject to the variable interest rate. An
	increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would result in an impact of £nil (2015: £nil, 2014: £nil).



	The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs
	at the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The year-end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the year.



	(E) LIQUIDITY RISK



	Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its
	financial obligations as they fall due.



	The Companys policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing
	operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term. The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Company is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.



	The following are the undiscounted contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments:



	Carrying Contractual 1 year 1 to <2 2 to <5 5 years



	amount cash fiows or less years
	years and over

	(F) CREDIT RISK



	Financial instruments that are subject to concentrations of credit risk
	consist of loans to subsidiaries, based in a variety of geographies and markets.



	EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK



	The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.



	FINANCIAL
	ASSETS



	None of the Companys cash equivalents or other financial receivables, including time deposits with banks, are past due or impaired. Regarding
	other financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired, there were no indications as at



	31 March 2016 (2015, 2014: no indications) that defaults in
	payment obligations will occur.

	The
	Companys related parties principally consist of Tata Sons Limited, subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures of Tata Sons Limited which includes Tata Motors Limited (the ultimate parent Company), subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures

Tata launched the Indica in 1998, the first fully indigenous Indian passenger car. Although initially criticized by auto analysts, its excellent fuel economy, powerful engine, and an aggressive marketing strategy made it one of the best-selling cars in the history of the Indian automobile industry. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, was a major improvement over the previous version and quickly became a mass favourite. Tata Motors also successfully exported large numbers of the car to South Africa. The success of the Indica played a key role in the growth of Tata Motors.[6]

Initially priced at ₹100,000 (US$1,500), the vehicle attracted a lot of attention for its relatively low price.
Tata Ace[edit]
Main article: Tata Ace




Tata Ace was India's first mini truck


Tata Ace, India's first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport. By October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[50] By 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors.
Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[51] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[52]
Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries' Global Electric Motorcars division.[53] In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel and Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta.
Tata 407[edit]
Main article: Tata 407
The Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[54] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales.

Tata Motors has jointly worked with Tata Daewoo to develop trucks such as Novus and World Truck and buses including GloBus and StarBus.

Tata Ace was India's first mini truck


Tata Ace, India's first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport. By October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[50] By 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors.
Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[51] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[52]
Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries' Global Electric Motorcars division.[53] In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel and Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta.
Tata 407[edit]
Main article: Tata 407
The Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[54] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales.

History[edit]




The first-generation(1998–07) Tata Indica; one of the best-selling cars in the history of the Indian automobile industry






Tata Bolt


Tata entered the commercial vehicle sector in 1954 after forming a joint venture with Daimler-Benz of Germany. After years of dominating the commercial vehicle market in India, Tata Motors entered the passenger vehicle market in 1991 by launching the Tata Sierra, a multi utility vehicle. Tata subsequently launched the Tata Estate (1992; a station wagon design based on the earlier 'TataMobile' (1989), a light commercial vehicle), the Tata Sumo (1994; LCV) and the Tata Safari (1998; India's first sports utility vehicle).
Tata launched the Indica in 1998, the first fully indigenous Indian passenger car. Although initially criticized by auto analysts, its excellent fuel economy, powerful engine, and an aggressive marketing strategy made it one of the best-selling cars in the history of the Indian automobile industry. A newer version of the car, named Indica V2, was a major improvement over the previous version and quickly became a mass favourite. Tata Motors also successfully exported large numbers of the car to South Africa. The success of the Indica played a key role in the growth of Tata Motors.[6]
In 2004, Tata Motors acquired Daewoo's South Korea-based truck manufacturing unit, Daewoo Commercial Vehicles Company, later renamed Tata Daewoo.[7]
On 27 September 2004, Tata Motors rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange to mark the listing of Tata Motors.[8]
In 2005, Tata Motors acquired a 21% controlling stake in the Spanish bus and coach manufacturer Hispano Carrocera.[9] Tata Motors continued its market area expansion through the introduction of new products such as buses (Starbus and Globus, jointly developed with subsidiary Hispano Carrocera) and trucks (Novus, jointly developed with subsidiary Tata Daewoo).
In 2006, Tata formed a joint venture with the Brazil-based Marcopolo, Tata Marcopolo Bus, to manufacture fully built buses and coaches.[10]
In 2008, Tata Motors acquired the English car maker Jaguar Land Rover, manufacturer of the Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Company.[11][12][13][14]
In May 2009, Tata unveiled the Tata World Truck range jointly developed with Tata Daewoo;[15] the range went on sale in South Korea, South Africa, the SAARC countries, and the Middle East at the end of 2009.[15]
Tata acquired full ownership of Hispano Carrocera in 2009.[16]
In 2009, its Lucknow plant was awarded the "Best of All" Rajiv Gandhi National Quality Award.[17]
In 2010, Tata Motors acquired an 80% stake in the Italian design and engineering company Trilix for €1.85 million. The acquisition formed part of the company's plan to enhance its styling and design capabilities.[18]
In 2012, Tata Motors announced it would invest around ₹6 billion in the development of Futuristic Infantry Combat Vehicles in collaboration with DRDO.[19]
In 2013, Tata Motors announced it will sell in India, the first vehicle in the world to run on compressed air (engines designed by the French company MDI) and dubbed "Mini CAT".
In 2014, Tata Motors introduced first Truck Racing championship in India "T1 Prima Truck Racing Championship".
On 26 January 2014, the Managing Director Karl Slym was found dead. He fell from the 22nd floor to the fourth floor of the Shangri-La Hotel in Bangkok, where he was to attend a meeting of Tata Motors Thailand.[20]

It is the second-largest heavy commercial vehicle manufacturer in South Korea and was acquired by Tata Motors in 2004. The principal reasons behind the acquisition were to reduce Tata's dependence on the Indian commercial vehicle market (which was responsible for around 94% of its sales in the MHCV segment and around 84% in the light commercial vehicle segment) and expand its product portfolio by leveraging on Daewoo's strengths in the heavy-tonnage sector.
Tata Motors has jointly worked with Tata Daewoo to develop trucks such as Novus and World Truck and buses including GloBus and StarBus.

Main article: Tata Nano




Tata Nano is often cited as the world's most affordable car


The Nano was launched in 2009 as a city car intended to appeal as an affordable alternative to the section of the Indian populace that is primarily the owner of motorcycles and has not bought their first car. Initially priced at ₹100,000 (US$1,500), the vehicle attracted a lot of attention for its relatively low price.
Tata Ace[edit]
Main article: Tata Ace




Tata Ace was India's first mini truck


Tata Ace, India's first indigenously developed sub-one-ton minitruck, was launched in May 2005. The minitruck was a huge success in India with auto analysts claiming that Ace had changed the dynamics of the light commercial vehicle (LCV) market in the country by creating a new market segment termed the small commercial vehicle segment. Ace rapidly emerged as the first choice for transporters and single truck owners for city and rural transport. By October 2005, LCV sales of Tata Motors had grown by 36.6% to 28,537 units due to the rising demand for Ace. The Ace was built with a load body produced by Autoline Industries.[50] By 2005, Autoline was producing 300 load bodies per day for Tata Motors.
Ace is still a top seller for TML with 500,000 units sold by June 2010.[51] In 2011, Tata Motors invested Rs 1000 crore in Dharwad Plant, Karnataka, with the capacity of 90,000 units annually and launched two models of 0.5-T capacity as Tata Ace Zip, Magic Iris.[52]
Ace has also been exported to several Asian, European, South American, and African countries and all-electric models are sold through Polaris Industries' Global Electric Motorcars division.[53] In Sri Lanka, it is sold through Diesel and Motor Engineering (DIMO) PLC under the name of DIMO Batta.
Tata 407[edit]
Main article: Tata 407
The Tata 407 is a light commercial vehicle (LCV) that has sold over 500,000 units since its launch in 1986.[54] In India, this vehicle dominates market share of the LCV category, accounting for close to 75% of LCV sales.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    Jaguar-Maker Tata Motors Fights Fires at Home
                                                


                                                    MarketWatch – 
                                                    5:18 AM ET 07/19/2017
                                                


It's hard to focus elsewhere when things at home aren't going well. That's the reality for Mumbai- and New York-listed Tata Motors (TTM), one of India's largest auto manufacturers.

not included in this registration statement. Those financial statements have been jointly audited in accordance with
Indian auditing standards by S.B.Billimoria & Co. and A.F.Ferguson & Co., whose joint audit reports for each of those years place reliance on other auditors as permitted by Indian auditing standards for approximately 1% of our Indian GAAP
consolidated total assets and 2% of our Indian GAAP consolidated total revenues. Until April 1, 2001, Indian GAAP did not require the preparation of consolidated financial statements and until April 1, 2002, did not require equity accounting for
affiliates, and accordingly, we have not previously prepared or published consolidated financial statements for fiscal years ending prior to April 1, 2002. For the purposes of this registration statement, we have retroactively prepared our selected
Indian GAAP financial data on a consolidated basis as of and for each of the years ended March 31, 2000 and 2001, and have adjusted our Indian GAAP financial data as of and for the year ended March 31, 2002 to equity account for our affiliates.
    The selected consolidated Indian GAAP financial data
as of and for each of the years ended March 31, 2000 and 2001 have been audited by S.B.Billimoria & Co. and are derived from our audited unconsolidated Indian GAAP financial statements and the audited unconsolidated financial statements of our
subsidiaries and affiliates, none of which are presented in this registration statement. Our audited unconsolidated financial statements, which account for approximately 98% of our Indian GAAP consolidated total assets and 95% of our Indian GAAP
consolidated total revenues, were jointly audited by S.B.Billimoria & Co. and A.F.Ferguson & Co. in accordance with Indian auditing standards and their audit reports for those years were unqualified.    You should read our selected financial data in conjunction with Item 5 –
“Operating and Financial Review and Prospects” – and Annex A – “Reconciliation of Net Income and Shareholders’ Equity between US GAAP and Indian GAAP”.

(1)
The consolidated financial data above account for Tata AutoComp Systems Ltd. for fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 and Concorde Motors Ltd. and Tata Precision Industries Pte. Ltd. for
fiscal 2003 and 2004 as equity method affiliates, as these entities do not fall within the definition of subsidiaries under Indian GAAP. 


(2)
During these periods, the following significant changes were made to our accounting policies, thereby affecting the financial data presented: 


 
(a)
Consequent to the accounting standard on ‘Intangible Assets’ (AS 26) becoming applicable, expenditure on product development which was earlier classified as deferred
revenue expenditure is now accounted for from April 1, 2003 in accordance with the said standard accordingly,  (i) Product
development cost including technical know-how on new vehicle platforms, variants on existing platforms and new vehicle aggregates are recognized as intangible assets and included under fixed assets. There is no effect of this change on the profit
for the year, as the period of amortization is consistent with that followed in the previous year.  (ii) Product development expenditure
relating to minor product enhancement, facelifts, upgrades etc. (including cost of incomplete development) amounting to Rs.516.4 million (including Rs.300.6 million incurred as at March 31, 2003) has been charged off during the year to profit and
loss account. 


 
(b)
In fiscal 2003 the rate of depreciation on laptop computers and cars increased from 16.21% and 9.5% to 23.8% and 19.0%, respectively, resulting in additional depreciation of Rs.66.3
million. 


 
(c)
Consequent to AS 22 “Accounting for Taxes on Income”, issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, or ICAI, becoming mandatory with effect from April 1,
2001, we have recorded the cumulative net deferred tax liability as at March 31, 2001 of Rs.3,113.7 million as a charge to the general reserve on April 1, 2001 and Rs.82.7 million against the accumulated profit and loss account.



 
(d)
In fiscal 2001, we have, with retrospective effect, changed our method of accounting for finance leases in accordance with the AS 19 “Leases”, issued by the ICAI.
Consequent to the change, the charge in fiscal 2001 was lower by Rs.200.1 million (including Rs.24.0 million in respect of previous fiscal years). 


 
(e)
In view of the revised Guidance Note issued by the ICAI, effective from the accounting period starting on or after April 1, 1999, which requires that provision should be made for
excise duty liability in respect of bonded goods, we have provided liability for excise duty and customs duty aggregating Rs.255.3 million, payable on goods held in bond at the year end, and therefore included the same in the valuation of
inventories at the year end. This had no effect on our profit for fiscal 2000. 


 
(f)
Revenues in each of the years presented is net of excise duty collected from customers. 


 
(g)
We have retroactively accounted for affiliates from April 1, 1999 for the purposes of this presentation. 


(3)
Extraordinary/ Exceptional Items: 


 
(a)
The extraordinary charge of Rs.69.5 million in fiscal 2004 was comprised entirely of employee separation costs. 


 
(b)
The extraordinary income of Rs.200.0 million in fiscal 2003 represents write-back of provision for contingencies for a future trade investment made in fiscal 2002.

Table of Contents


 
(c)
The extraordinary charge of Rs.542.9 million in fiscal 2002 was comprised of provision for diminution in value of investments of Rs.13.7 million, provision for contingencies of
Rs.200.0 million and employee separation costs of Rs.329.2 million. 


 
(d)
The extraordinary charge of Rs.703.1 million in fiscal 2001 was comprised of employee separation costs of Rs.213.2 million and power costs relating to prior years of Rs.489.9
million. 


(4)
In fiscal 2002, consequent to our shareholders’ approval and the order of the High Court of Judicature at Mumbai dated May 2, 2002, Tata Motors Ltd. adjusted the debit balance
of deferred revenue expenditure of Rs.9,500.5 million, capital work in progress of Rs.1,976.1 million and diminution in the value of investment of Rs.312.5 million in its Securities Premium Account. The deferred tax liability of Rs.3,415.2 million
created in respect thereof has been credited to its Securities Premium Account.    Exchange Rate Information    For convenience, some of the financial amounts presented in this registration statement have been translated from rupee amounts into dollar amounts at the rate of Rs.43.40 = US$1.00, based on the noon buying rate for cable transfers as
certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as of March 31, 2004, the date of our most recent balance sheet included in this registration statement. However, such translations do not imply that the rupee amounts have been,
could have been or could be converted into dollars at that or any other rate.    The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information with respect to the exchange rate between the rupee and the dollar (in rupees per dollar) based on the average of the telegraphic transfer buying
and selling rupee/dollar exchange rates quoted by Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

D. Risk Factors.    This section describes the risks that we currently believe may materially affect our business. The factors below should be considered in connection with
any forward-looking statements in this registration statement and the cautionary statements on page iii. The risks below are not the only ones we face – some risks may be unknown to us, and some risks that we do not currently believe to be
material could later turn out to be material. One or more of a combination of these risks could materially impact our business, revenues, sales, net assets, results of operations liquidity and capital resources.    Risks Associated with Our Business    General economic conditions could significantly adversely affect our sales and results
of operations.    The Indian automotive industry is
substantially affected by general economic conditions in India. In 1999, the automotive industry witnessed a recovery in demand after declining trends for two years. Demand for four-wheel vehicles again declined in the period from 2000 to late 2001,
driven by poor economic conditions in India. Though there has been a significant increase in demand since early 2002, primarily due to significant growth of the gross domestic product, or GDP, and the construction of improved roadways in India,
there can be no assurance that the Indian economy will not experience a downturn which may, in turn, significantly adversely affect our sales and results of operations. One driver of demand is the level of market interest rates, which impacts the
cost of financing for purchasers of our products. While interest rates declined steadily during the last two years, there is no assurance that this trend will continue and an increase in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on demand
for our products. Interest rates in the United States and some other countries have recently been increasing and this may lead to interest rate increases in India and other countries. On the other hand, decreases in market interest rates may lead to
higher levels of prepayments of our loans receivable from customers, as they may seek to refinance their loans elsewhere. Although we have not experienced significant prepayments during past periods of declining interest rates, and while prepayments
have not had any material adverse impact on our results of operations in the past, there can be no assurance that prepayments during periods of declining interest rates will not have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the
future as we seek to expand our customer financing business.    If we are
unable to implement our growth strategies in a timely manner, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.    We have adopted certain growth strategies, including the expansion of our automotive business through upgrading of our existing products, the introduction
of new products and an increase in international business. All these new projects involve risks and difficulties and, accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete our plans on schedule or within budget. If market
conditions change, if operations do not generate sufficient funds or for any other reason, we may decide to delay, modify or forego some aspects of our growth strategies. Our future results of operations may be materially adversely affected if we
are unable to implement our growth strategies.    Increased competition in
the Indian automotive industry may adversely affect our results of operations.    We face strong competition in India across our product lines from other Indian and foreign automotive manufacturers. Competition is expected to intensify as Indian automotive manufacturers obtain greater access to
debt and equity financing in the international capital markets or gain access to more advanced technology through alliances. Foreign automotive manufacturers have increased and are expected to further increase their participation in the Indian
automotive market through technology transfers, joint ventures and direct investments.

The Indian automotive industry has historically been protected against competition from imported goods
through a number of import restrictions, taxes and duties on automotive and related products. Many of those restrictions, however, have recently been lifted or relaxed. In 2001, all quantitative restrictions on the import of automobiles into India
were removed. Additionally, in recent years, the Government of India has permitted automatic approvals for foreign equity ownership of up to 100% in entities manufacturing vehicles and components in India. These changes have led to dramatically
increased competition from imported vehicles, including second hand or pre-owned vehicles. Though there remain relatively high tariffs on imports of vehicles and components, we expect tariffs on the import of components and cars in completely built
units, or CBUs, and/or completely knocked down units, or CKDs, to be reduced in the future in line with India’s obligations under its World Trade Organization agreement. There can be no assurance that there will be no further reductions in
import duties on automotive products or a relaxation or removal of import restrictions, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations.    Increases in diesel fuel prices or increased demand for gasoline fuel-powered vehicles could adversely affect the demand for our products.    A significant proportion of our products are powered by diesel fuel engines.
Retail prices for diesel fuel in India have historically been significantly lower than retail prices for gasoline. However, due to the elimination of some fuel price controls in India and global movements in market prices of crude oil, the gap
between retail prices of diesel fuel and gasoline in India has been narrowing. A sudden shift in demand away from diesel fuel-powered vehicles in India, which may occur if the price differential between diesel fuel and gasoline continued to decline
significantly or if there is a substantial increase in diesel prices, could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.    Delays in construction of improved roadways in India could adversely affect the demand for our existing and future products.    Our medium and long term business plans are based on the assumption that new
large roadway projects in India undertaken by the Government of India will proceed according to announced plans. If these roadways are not constructed according to these plans, the demand for our current and new products may not achieve the levels
we anticipate and accordingly may lead to lower sales and profits.    Compliance with increasingly stringent safety or emissions standards relating to our products or our manufacturing facilities, or other environmental regulations, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.
   In the last few years, the Government of India has
introduced several regulations regarding emission levels, noise and safety of automotive products, as well as levels of pollutants generated by the plants that produce automotive vehicles. These regulations are likely to become more stringent and
the cost of complying with these regulations may be significant. To comply with the requirements of environmental regulation, we may have to incur substantial capital and product development expenditure and research and development costs to upgrade
our products and our manufacturing facilities, which may increase our cost of production and thereby adversely affect our results of operations. If we are unable to comply with these standards within the time frame provided to us, our production and
sales may be adversely affected.    Taxes and other levies imposed by the
central or state governments in India on the acquisition and ownership of automotive vehicles, or regulations applying to us may have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products.    Taxes and other levies imposed by the central or state governments in India
that affect our industry include customs duties on imports of capital goods, raw materials and components, excise duty on the manufacture of automotive vehicles, service tax, central and state sales tax, octroi duties, value added tax (currently
under consideration by the Government of India), road and registration tax.

Table of Contents
These taxes and levies affect the cost of production and prices of our products and therefore the demand
for our products. In addition, restrictions or levies imposed by the government on the use of automotive vehicles, such as a congestion charge or other traffic control measures, or on diesel vehicles in particular, could affect the demand for our
automotive vehicles in the future. An increase in any of these taxes or levies, or the imposition of new taxes or levies in the future, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    We are dependent on a limited number of vendors for the supply of critical components,
consumables and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products.    We depend on external suppliers for the supply of raw materials, components and some spare parts for our products. We currently have an aggregate of approximately 1,100 vendors of components in India. We collaborate
closely with our vendors in order to secure a reliable supply of components that meet our requirements and to generate economies of scale. Additionally, we have equity interests through shareholders agreements with some of our vendors and can
significantly influence these entities. As a result of this approach, for some raw materials and several inputs in our manufacturing process for aggregates, such as engines, transmissions, axles and fuel pumps, we rely on a sole vendor or only a
limited number of vendors, including Tata Cummins Ltd. for our engines. The failure by a vendor to adhere to our technical specifications, quality requirements and production and delivery schedules could disrupt our manufacturing process. In
addition, a vendor on whom we are dependent may raise its prices, may experience a delay in its ability to produce or deliver products, or a dispute may arise between us and the vendor. If we are dependent on a sole vendor or a limited number of
vendors for a critical input, we may find it difficult to replace a vendor on a timely basis and at reasonable cost, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. `    We are subject to risks associated with product warranty, recall and product liability
costs due to defects in our products or related after-sales services, which could generate adverse publicity and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.    Defects, if any, in our products could require us to undertake service
actions or vehicle recalls. These actions could require us to expend considerable resources in correcting these problems and could adversely affect demand for our products. Defects in our products that arise from defective components or spare parts
supplied by our vendors may be covered under warranties provided by our vendors. Although we obtain product liability insurance for the automotive vehicles we sell in some international markets, we are not covered by insurance for product liability
claims for products sold in India. An unusual number or amount of warranty claims against a vendor could affect us adversely because we depend on a limited number of vendors for the supply of raw materials and components, including some of our
affiliates. Repeated warranty claims may result in a rise in our cost of obtaining insurance. In addition, these claims could have an impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition as some of our vendors are our
subsidiaries and affiliates. Further, if a vendor fails to meet quality standards, it could be exposed to warranty and other product liability costs, and expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Any defects in our products or after-sales
services provided by us, authorized dealers or third parties could also result in customer claims for damages. In defending these claims, we could incur substantial costs and receive adverse publicity. Management resources could be diverted away
from our business towards defending these claims. As a result, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer. We cannot assure you that the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts with vendors will be
enforceable in all instances or will otherwise protect us from liability for damages.

Increases in the cost of raw materials and automobile components may have a material adverse impact on our results
of operations.    In fiscal 2003 and 2004, consumption
of raw materials and components formed approximately 77.1% and 77.6%, respectively, of our cost of sales. If costs of raw materials and components rise, and if we are not able to recover these costs through cost saving measures elsewhere or are
unable to increase the selling prices of our vehicles due to competitive pressure, our margins and results of operations would be adversely affected. For example, prices for much of the steel we use in vehicle manufacturing have increased
significantly in recent periods and we have not been able to fully pass along these increases through higher selling prices for our vehicles.    Potential delays in the launch of new models in the market and lower than anticipated market acceptance of new or existing models can cause us to lose market share
and adversely affect our results of operations.    In a
highly competitive environment where the Indian automotive industry currently has excess capacity, competitors can gain a significant advantage by introducing a new model in a particular segment before we do. In addition, the launch of a new model
requires substantial capital investment and product development expenditure and generally higher initial production costs. The capital investments in plant and machinery, in addition to product development costs, associated with the launch of a new
model may result in higher levels of depreciation and amortization. Our loss in fiscal 2002 was partially attributable to these factors and similar investments by us in the future may have an adverse impact on our profitability. Therefore, if market
acceptance of any of our new models is lower than anticipated, we may be unable to gain the intended economic benefits of our investments and higher cost of production, and our results of operations may be adversely affected.    We have made and may continue to make capital commitments to our subsidiaries and
affiliates and if the business and operations of subsidiaries and affiliates to whom we make capital commitments deteriorate, we may be required to write down or write off our investments in these subsidiaries or affiliates in the future.
   We have made and continue to make capital
investments, loans, advances and other commitments to support our subsidiaries and affiliates. These investments and commitments have included capital contributions to enhance the financial condition or liquidity position of our subsidiaries and
affiliates. If the business and operations of these subsidiaries and affiliates deteriorate, we may suffer losses and our investments may be required to be written down or written off. Additionally, our loans or advances may not be repaid or may
need to be restructured or we may be required to outlay capital under our commitments to support these companies.    Fluctuations in exchange rates could result in foreign exchange losses.    Devaluations or depreciation of the value of the rupee can influence the cost of our borrowings denominated in currencies
other than rupees and increase the cost of our imports, while an appreciation of the value of the rupee, which has occurred against the dollar since early 2003, can adversely impact our exports. As of March 31, 2004, approximately 63.6% of our
borrowings were denominated in dollars and other non-rupee currencies. Further, in fiscal 2003 and 2004, 4.2% and 4.6%, respectively, of our total raw material costs were incurred in dollars and other non-rupee currencies, and in fiscal 2003 and
2004, 5.4% and 7.9%, respectively, of our total revenues were derived from international markets. Any significant fluctuation to our disadvantage in exchange rates may have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Although we engage in some
currency hedging in order to decrease our foreign exchange exposure, a weakening of the rupee against the dollar and other major foreign currencies may have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing in rupee terms and consequently may increase the
cost of financing our expenditure in rupee terms. In addition,   
11 


Table of Contents
we have experienced and can be expected to continue to experience foreign exchange losses and gains on obligations
denominated in foreign currencies in respect of our borrowings and foreign currency assets and liabilities. Although the fluctuations in the value of the rupee against the dollar has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
results of operations in recent periods, the depreciation in the value of the rupee against the dollar in recent months may lead to adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations during the current fiscal year and in future
periods, in part because of the additional dollar-denominated debt that we have incurred during the first quarter of the current fiscal year.    We need to successfully integrate and manage our mergers or acquisitions to maintain profitability.    We recently acquired Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd. (now named Tata
Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd. or TDCV) in South Korea. We also continue to evaluate other merger and acquisition opportunities and plan to make additional mergers or acquisitions in the future if suitable opportunities arise. These may dilute
our earnings per share as a result of the specific scope of the business or condition of the operations being merged with or acquired. Mergers and acquisitions involve risks, including:   


 
•
unforeseen contingent risks or latent liabilities relating to these businesses that may only become apparent after the merger or acquisition is finalized; 
 


 
•
integration and management of the operations and systems;   


 
•
retention of select personnel;   


 
•
coordination of sales and marketing efforts;   


 
•
management of a larger business; and   


 
•
diversion of management’s attention from other ongoing business concerns.   
If we are unable to successfully integrate and manage our pending acquisition, as well as any future mergers or acquisitions that we might pursue, our
growth plans may not be met and our profitability may decline.    We may be
adversely affected by labor unrest    All of our regular
employees and those of our consolidated subsidiaries in India, other than management, are members of labor unions and are covered by our wage agreements with those labor unions that have varying terms (typically three years) at different locations.
Our wage agreements for Pune (excluding the car plant), the Pune car plant, Jamshedpur, Mumbai and Lucknow are valid until August 31, 2006, March 31, 2007, March 31, 2007, December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005, respectively. In general, we consider
our labor relations with all of our employees to be good. However, in March 2000, we were compelled to declare a lock-out in our Lucknow factory, which was lifted in September 2000 on the formation of a new union. Though we have not experienced any
other labor unrest since 2000, we may in the future be subject to labor unrest, which may delay or disrupt our operations in the affected regions, including the acquisition of raw materials and parts, the manufacture, sales and distribution of
products and the provision of services. If such work stoppages or lock-outs occur or continue for a long period of time, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.

Risks Associated with Investments in an Indian Company    Political instability or changes in the Government in India could delay the further
liberalization of the Indian economy and adversely affect economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular.    Substantially all of our manufacturing and sales and distribution facilities are located in India, and in fiscal 2003 and 2004 approximately 95% and 92%
respectively, of our revenues were derived from the domestic market. Our business, and the market price and liquidity of our ADSs and shares, may be affected by foreign exchange rates and controls, interest rates, changes in government policy,
taxation, social and civil unrest and other political, economic or other developments in or affecting India.    Since 1991, successive Indian Governments have pursued policies of economic liberalization, including significantly relaxing restrictions on the private
sector. Nevertheless, the roles of the Indian central and state governments in the Indian economy as producers, consumers and regulators have remained significant. In a general election that took place in India in April and May 2004, the incumbent
coalition government of the National Democratic Alliance, formed in October 1999, was defeated and the United Progressive Alliance, a multi-party coalition headed by the Congress Party, has formed the new government. Though the Congress Party has
publicly indicated an intention to continue India’s program of economic reform through a program agreed to in consultation with all coalition parties, the United Progressive Alliance consists of parties with differing agendas, which could
result in political instability, and as such the rate of economic liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies affecting automotive companies, foreign investment, currency exchange and other matters affecting investment in our
securities could change as well. Uncertainty regarding possible policy changes immediately after elections has in the past resulted in significant volatility in price and trading volumes of securities of Indian companies. A significant change in
India’s economic liberalization and deregulation policies could adversely affect business and economic conditions in India generally, and our business in particular, if new restrictions on the private sector are introduced or if existing
restrictions are increased.    Regional conflicts in Asia and other export
markets could adversely affect the Indian economy and cause our business to suffer.    The Asian region has from time to time experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries, including between India and Pakistan. Since May 1999, military confrontations between India and
Pakistan have occurred in Kashmir. Also, since early 2003, there have been military hostilities and civil unrest in Afghanistan and Iraq. Events of this nature in the future, as well as social and civil unrest within other countries in Asia, could
influence the Indian economy and could have a material adverse effect on the market for securities of Indian companies, including our ADSs and shares, and on the market for our vehicles.    The sale of our shares by foreign investors to Indian residents is subject to restrictions under Indian law, which may adversely
impact the market price of our ADSs and shares.    Under
current Indian regulations and practice, the approval of the RBI is required for the sale of our shares (including shares withdrawn from our ADS facilities) by a non-resident of India to a resident of India, unless the sale is made through a stock
exchange. Under currency exchange controls that are in effect in India, any approval granted by the RBI will specify a limit on the price at which our shares may be transferred based on a specified formula, and a higher price per share may not be
permitted. Additionally, shareholders who seek to convert the rupee proceeds from a sale of shares in India into foreign currency and repatriate that foreign currency from India will have to obtain RBI approval for each transaction unless sold
through a stock exchange. We cannot assure you that any required approval from the RBI or any other government agency can be obtained on any particular terms or at all. See “Item 10.D –Exchange Controls”.

Rights of shareholders under Indian law may be more limited than under the laws of other jurisdictions.
   Our articles of association, which include
regulations applicable to our Board of Directors, and Indian law govern our corporate affairs. Legal principles relating to these matters and the validity of corporate procedures, directors’ fiduciary duties and liabilities, and
shareholders’ rights may differ from those that would apply to a company in another jurisdiction. Shareholders’ rights under Indian law may not be as extensive as shareholders’ rights under the laws of other countries or
jurisdictions, including the United States. You may have more difficulty in asserting your rights as a shareholder than you would as a shareholder of a corporation organized in another jurisdiction.    Investors may have difficulty enforcing judgments against us or our management.
   We are a limited liability company incorporated under
the laws of India. Almost all of our directors and executive officers named in this registration statement are residents of India. Further, almost all of our assets and the assets of these directors and executive officers are located in India. As a
result, investors may find it difficult to (i) effect service of process upon us or these directors and executive officers in jurisdictions outside India, (ii) enforce court judgments obtained outside India, including those based upon the civil
liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, against us or these directors and executive officers (iii) enforce, in an Indian court, court judgments obtained outside India, including those based upon the civil liability provisions of
the U.S. federal securities laws, against us or these directors and executive officers, and (iv) obtain expeditious adjudication of an original action in an Indian court to enforce liabilities, including those based upon the U.S. federal securities
laws, against us or these directors and executive officers.    India is not a party to any international treaty in relation to the recognition or enforcement of foreign judgments. Recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments is provided for under Section 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, or
the Civil Code. Section 13 and Section 44A of the Civil Code provide that a foreign judgment shall be conclusive as to any matter thereby directly adjudicated upon except (i) where it has not been pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction,
(ii) where it has not been given on the merits of the case, (iii) where it appears on the face of the proceedings to be founded on an incorrect view of international law or a refusal to recognize the law of India in cases where Indian law is
applicable, (iv) where the proceedings in which the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice, (v) where it has been obtained by fraud or (vi) where it sustains a claim founded on a breach of any law in force in India.    Section 44A of the Civil Code provides that where a foreign judgment has been
rendered by a superior court in any country or territory outside India which the Government has by notification declared to be a reciprocating territory, it may be enforced in India by proceedings in execution as if the judgment had been rendered by
the relevant court in India. However, Section 44A of the Civil Code is applicable only to monetary decrees not being in the nature of any amounts payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty.
   The United States has not been declared by the Government of
India to be a reciprocating territory for the purpose of Section 44A of the Civil Code. Accordingly, a judgment of a court in the United States may be enforced only by a suit upon the judgment and not by proceedings in execution. The suit must be
brought in India within three years from the date of the judgment in the same manner as any other suit filed to enforce a civil liability in India. It is unlikely that a court in India would award damages on the same basis as a foreign court if an
action is brought in India. Furthermore, it is unlikely that an Indian court would enforce foreign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages awarded as excessive or inconsistent with Indian practice. A party seeking to enforce a foreign judgment
in India is required to obtain approval from the RBI to execute such a judgment or to repatriate outside India any amount recovered.

Risks Relating to our Shares and ADSs    Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the rupee and the dollar may have a material adverse effect on the value of the ADSs and the
Shares, independent of our operating results.    The
price of our ADSs will be quoted in dollars. Our shares are quoted in rupees on the Bombay Stock Exchange, or BSE, the National Stock Exchange of India, or NSE, and three other stock exchanges in India. Our application for delisting is pending for
confirmation with these three other stock exchanges in India. Any dividends in respect of our shares will be paid in rupees and subsequently converted into dollars for distribution to ADS holders. Market prices for our ADSs may fall if the value of
the rupee declines against the dollar. In addition, the dollar amount of any cash dividends or other cash payments to holders of our ADSs would decline if the value of the rupee declines against the dollar. ADS holders who seek to sell in India any
shares represented by ADSs or any shares withdrawn upon surrender of any ADSs, and to convert the rupee proceeds of their sale into foreign currency and remit the foreign currency from India, will require the approval of the RBI for each of these
transactions unless these shares are sold on a stock exchange in India on which these shares are listed. A delay in obtaining approval of the RBI might adversely affect the rate of exchange available for conversion of such rupee proceeds into
foreign currencies.    The exchange rate between the rupee and
the dollar has changed substantially in the last two decades and may fluctuate substantially in the future. On an annual average basis, the rupee declined against the dollar from 1980 to 2002. The rupee lost approximately 15% of its value relative
to the dollar in the three year period ended March 31, 2002, depreciating from a rate of Rs.42.50 = US$1.00 on March 31, 1999, to a rate of Rs.48.83 = US$1.00 on March 29, 2002, the last business day of our fiscal year ended March 31, 2002. During
fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 the rupee generally appreciated in value against the dollar, from an exchange rate of Rs.48.83 = US$1.00 on March 29, 2002 to an exchange rate of Rs.43.40 = US$1.00 as of March 31, 2004. Since the beginning of our current
fiscal year, the rupee has depreciated in value against the dollar from an exchange rate of Rs.43.40 = US$1.00 as of March 31, 2004 to Rs.46.34 = US$1.00 as of August 10, 2004.    The market value of your investment may fluctuate due to the volatility of the Indian securities market.    The Indian stock exchanges have, in the past, experienced substantial
fluctuations in the prices of their listed securities. The Indian stock exchanges, including the BSE, have experienced problems that, if they continue or recur, could affect the market price and liquidity of the securities of Indian companies,
including our shares. These problems have included temporary exchange closures, broker defaults, settlement delays and strikes by brokers. In addition, the governing bodies of the Indian stock exchanges have from time to time imposed restrictions on
trading in certain securities, limitations on price movements and margin requirements. Furthermore, from time to time disputes have occurred between listed companies, and stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies, which in some cases may have had
a negative effect on market sentiment.    There is a lower level
of regulation and monitoring of the Indian securities markets and the activities of investors, brokers and other participants than in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Board of India, or SEBI, received statutory powers in 1992 to assist
it in carrying out its responsibility for improving disclosure and other regulatory standards for the Indian securities markets. Subsequently, SEBI has prescribed regulations and guidelines in relation to disclosure requirements, insider dealing and
other matters relevant to the Indian securities market. There may, however, be less publicly available information about Indian companies than is regularly made available by public companies in the United States.

Holders of ADSs have fewer rights than shareholders and must act through the depositary to exercise those rights.
   Although holders of ADSs have a right to receive any
dividends declared in respect of Shares underlying the ADSs, they cannot exercise voting or other direct rights as a shareholder with respect to the Shares underlying the ADSs evidenced by ADRs. Citibank, N.A., as depositary is the registered
shareholder of the deposited shares underlying our ADSs, and therefore only Citibank, N.A. can exercise the rights of shareholders in connection with the deposited shares. Only if requested by us, the depositary will notify holders of ADSs of
upcoming votes and arrange to deliver our voting materials to holders of ADSs. The depositary will try, insofar as practicable, subject to Indian laws and the provisions of our Articles of Association, to vote or have its agents vote the deposited
securities as instructed by the holders of ADSs. If the depositary timely receives voting instructions from a holder of ADSs which fail to specify the manner in which the depositary is to vote the shares underlying such holder’s ADSs, such
holder will be deemed to have instructed the depositary to vote in favor of the items set forth in such voting instructions. If the depositary has not received timely instructions from a holder of ADSs, the holder shall be deemed to have instructed
the depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us, subject to the conditions set forth in the deposit agreement. If requested by us, the depositary is required to represent all shares underlying ADSs, regardless whether
timely instructions have been received from the holders of such ADSs, for the sole purpose of establishing a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. Additionally, in your capacity as an ADS holder, you will not be able to bring a derivative action,
examine accounting books and records of the company, or exercise appraisal rights. Registered holders of our shares withdrawn from the depositary arrangements will be entitled to vote and exercise other direct shareholder rights in accordance with
Indian law. However, a holder may not know about a meeting sufficiently in advance to withdraw the underlying shares in time. Furthermore, a holder of ADSs may not receive voting materials, if we do not instruct the depositary to distribute such
materials, or may not receive such voting materials in time to instruct the depositary to vote.    See “Item 10. Additional Information –B. Memorandum and Articles of Association – Voting Rights” for a more detailed discussion of the
manner in which a holder of ADSs can exercise its voting rights and “Item 12 – Description of Securities other than Equity Securities – D. Description of American Depositary Shares – Dividends and Distributions” for a
discussion on the rights and limitations applicable to holders of ADSs in respect of dividends and distributions made in respect of Shares underlying the ADSs.   

Item 4. Information on the Company.    A.
History and Development of the Company.    We were
incorporated on September 1, 1945 as a public limited liability company under the Indian Companies Act VII of 1913 as Tata Locomotive and Engineering Company Limited. Our name was changed to Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited on
September 24, 1960 and to Tata Motors Limited on July 29, 2003. We commenced operations as a steam locomotive manufacturer. This business was discontinued in 1971 when our last locomotive was made. Since 1954 we have been manufacturing automotive
vehicles. This business commenced with the manufacture of commercial vehicles under a financial and technical collaboration with Daimler-Benz AG (now DaimlerChrysler AG) of Germany. This agreement ended in 1969. Since then, we have been developing
and manufacturing all our automotive vehicles in-house.    We
have continuously been expanding and upgrading our automotive product portfolio and have added a wide range of vehicles. Our most significant achievement in this field has been the design and development of India’s first and, currently, only
fully indigenous contemporary compact car, the Indica. The launch of the Indica in 1998 and its upgraded V2 version in fiscal 2001 has been followed by a second

offering, the Indigo, in the mid-size segment. Since its launch in December 2002, the Indigo has been the highest selling
model in the mid-size segment in India. We have also recently launched a facelift of the Indica and unveiled the Indigo Marina, which is expected to be commercially introduced in fiscal 2005.    We currently manufacture commercial vehicles ranging from a GVW of 2.5 to 40
metric tonnes, the Indica and Indigo passenger cars and the Sumo and Safari range of utility vehicles. We manufactured our one-millionth vehicle in fiscal 1991 and our two-millionth vehicle in fiscal 1998. In 2003, we achieved the milestone of
having manufactured our three millionth vehicle since entering the automotive vehicle business in 1954, including our 500,000th passenger vehicle. In March 2004, we acquired 100% of Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd. of South Korea (now named Tata
Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd., or TDCV).    We believe we
have established a position of technological leadership among Indian automotive manufacturers through our in-house research and development activities, with assistance from foreign research consultants from time to time. Our Engineering Research
Centre, or ERC, has enabled us to successfully design, develop and produce our own range of vehicles. In addition, we have designed and manufactured a significant portion of our production facilities, assembly lines and machinery. Our ERC continues
to focus on products at the forefront of safety, comfort and emission norms in India. See “— Research and Development”.    Our operations include 11 consolidated subsidiaries and four material equity method affiliates, in respect of which we exercise significant influence.
Tata Incorporated serves as our authorized United States representative.

cars, utility vehicles and commercial vehicles (trucks, pick-ups and buses), in India in fiscal 2003 and 2004 was 23.4%
and 25.2%, respectively. We have a market share in medium and heavy commercial vehicles, or MHCVs, in India of approximately 63.5% and 64.0% for fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively, and have a significant presence in the compact and mid-size car
market. For further details about our market shares, please see “— Competition” below.    In India, we distribute our automotive products through 29 regional sales centers and a domestic network of over 400 independent dealer outlets. We have
also established a nation-wide network of authorized after sales service centers. We distribute vehicles in South Korea through Daewoo Motor Sales Corporation, or DMSC, and the international sales of TDCV are through Daewoo International, Daewoo
Construction and through our international vehicle distribution channel.    We operate four principal automotive manufacturing facilities that are located at Jamshedpur in eastern India, at Pune in western India, at Lucknow in northern India, and at Gunsan in South Korea. Our Indian vehicles
are manufactured almost entirely from components made in India, many of which, including engines, transmissions and axles, are produced by us or our subsidiaries and affiliates with others being sourced from third party suppliers. We import only a
limited number of specialized parts and components for our vehicles and specialized grades of steel. The vehicles made in South Korea are assembled primarily from Korea-manufactured aggregates and components, although some of the major aggregates
are sourced from U.S. and European component suppliers. We had approximately 28,900 permanent employees, including approximately 7,000 permanent employees at our consolidated subsidiaries, as of March 31, 2004.     The Indian Automotive Market    The liberalization of the Indian economy has created significant
opportunities for growth in the Indian automotive industry. Vehicle demand in India is generally affected by:   


 
•
GDP;

A revival in economic conditions in fiscal 2003 and 2004 after nearly three years of low growth led to a
sharp increase in sales of automotive vehicles in India to the highest ever level, with total sales of 1,161,000 units in fiscal 2004. We achieved a market share of 25.2% of all four-wheel vehicles sold in India in fiscal 2004. Due to the continued
growth of the Indian economy and available trends in fiscal 2005 combined with increased credit availability at lower interest rates, we expect that sales of automotive vehicles in categories in which our products are positioned in India will
continue to grow in fiscal 2005.    The Indian automotive
industry is in the process of integrating itself with the rest of the world and, in recent years, has been affected by government regulation aimed at reducing harmful effects on the environment, enhancing vehicle safety and improving fuel economy.
These regulations have added to the cost of vehicle production.    The opening of the Indian automotive market has led to increased competition as foreign global automotive industry leaders have continued to increase their presence in India. In fiscal 2002, the Indian Government released its proposed Auto
Policy. This policy outlines a vision to establish a globally competitive automobile industry in India, and to double its contribution to the Indian economy by 2010. It also aims to promote integrated, phased, enduring and self-sustaining growth of
the Indian automotive industry. The stated policy objectives are to:   


 
•
Promote the sector as a lever of industrial growth and employment and to achieve a high degree of value addition in the country;   


 
•
Promote a globally competitive automotive industry and emerge as a global source for automotive components;   


 
•
Establish an international hub for manufacturing small, affordable passenger cars and a key center for manufacturing tractors and two-wheel vehicles in the world;
  


 
•
Ensure a balanced transition to open trade at a minimal risk to the Indian economy and local industry;   


 
•
Promote continued modernization of the industry and facilitate indigenous design, research and development;   


 
•
Steer India’s software industry into automotive technology;   


 
•
Assist development of vehicles propelled by alternative energy sources; and   


 
•
Develop domestic safety and environmental standards to be at par with international standards.    We believe that we have the resources, strategies and technologies in place to compete effectively in the industry despite
the increasing competitive pressures. In addition, we believe that our research and development initiatives, particularly the development of environmentally friendly new vehicle technologies at affordable levels for consumers, provide us with a
strategic advantage as a global competitor.    Our ability to
compete in the consolidating global automotive industry will depend in part on the successful implementation of our business strategy. This is subject to a number of factors, some of which are not in our control. For details on these factors, please
see “Item 3. Key Information — Risk Factors”.

Our Strategy    In this dynamic and competitive environment, our objective is to enhance our position and emerge as India’s leading automotive manufacturer in all
product categories in which we operate, as well as increasing our global reach. We intend to achieve this objective by leveraging our existing strengths, developing expertise and continuing as a low-cost, high-quality manufacturer. We also plan to
increase our overseas sales by developing products that will be successful in international markets as well as through acquisitions in key regions.    We believe that our strong position in the Indian automotive industry has resulted from the following factors:   


 
•
Timely introduction of new products and upgrading of existing products that meet consumer demands and incorporation of superior design, environmental and safety technologies;
  


 
•
Continuing focus on high quality and low-cost manufacturing;   


 
•
Commitment to investment in research and development and sales and production infrastructure; and   


 
•
Financial strength, which enables us to achieve the above objectives.    Our goal is to continue to be a market leader in the Indian automotive industry and grow to become a global automotive player. The key elements of our
strategy are as follows:    Leveraging our Broad Product
Range. We consider ourselves well positioned to compete across a broad range of products in the Indian automotive market due to strong brand recognition in India, our strong in-house engineering and manufacturing capabilities, extensive
distribution network and good understanding of local consumer preferences. Our acquisition of TDCV has provided us with a complementary range of heavy vehicles which will help us accelerate our strategy of building global products.    We also believe that growth opportunities exist in a number of sectors of the
Indian automotive market. We plan to introduce new products including a low cost car and a new global truck, upgrades and variants of our existing products and increase production of fully-built commercial vehicles while also capitalizing on the
success of our recently introduced products.    Increasing
the scale of operations. We intend to further strengthen our competitive advantage, build up economies of scale for us and our key vendors and simultaneously diversify our revenue profile by pursuing different markets. Increasing vehicle
sales volumes substantially will be the key to this strategy. We aim to increase our domestic market share through continuously upgrading and widening our current product range as well as expanding our distribution network, and supplement this with
initiatives in the international markets.    Inorganic
Growth. We recently acquired the truck division of Daewoo Motor Company in South Korea. This acquisition represents a major step in our corporate history. We will continue to look for other acquisitions with a view towards achieving our goal
of becoming a global automotive company.    Reducing Costs
and Breakeven Points. Since fiscal 2001, we have made significant reductions in our expense base, having achieved a cumulative reduction in fixed, variable and financial expenses. This has had a direct impact on our results of operations and
contributed significantly to our return to profitability in fiscal 2003 and 2004. We continue to place an emphasis on reduction of production costs, overhead and other general costs, including by means of value engineering and cycle time reduction
and more stringent   
20 


Table of Contents
working capital controls. We will continue to work with international and local operational and management consultants to
achieve continued cost reductions and management efficiencies. We believe that productivity improvements and operational efficiencies will help lower our break-even levels and thus improve our results of operations.    Continuing Focus on High Quality and Enhancing Customer
Orientation. Our commitment to quality and customer service has been a significant competitive strength, and one of our principal goals is to achieve international quality standards for our entire line of products and services. Our attention
to quality has enabled us to offer industry-leading warranties in India, and competitive warranties in our overseas markets. In addition, we have built an extensive sales and after-sales service network, which has enabled us to provide quality
customer service. In an effort toward further improving our responsiveness to market and customer service needs, we have recently embarked on a Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, initiative, which is an information technology support system
to enable us to better understand and service our customer requirements. We have also recently introduced a new product introduction, or NPI, initiative and a quality function deployment, or QFD, initiative, which are programs aimed at facilitating
increased channels of customer feedback in order to enhance compatibility between customer preferences and our products.    Expanding our Distribution and Service Reach. Our automotive distribution network is one of the largest distribution networks in India. Our
total distribution network in India spreads across 500 cities with over 400 outlets and is expected to further increase in line with market expansion. In South Korea we have 38 service outlets. We plan to continue to expand the reach of our network
to cater to the increasing demand for our products.    Expanding Our International Business. In order to counter-balance the cyclical nature of the domestic automotive industry, we intend to focus more of our efforts on overseas markets in the future, both through organic and
inorganic growth. These initiatives include focusing on key markets and select segments, joint ventures and mergers and acquisitions that will help us make inroads into markets with high barriers of entry resulting from regulatory regimes or
advanced stages of market development.    Forming
Alliances. In December 2002, we entered into an agreement with the MG Rover Group for the sale and distribution of the Indica passenger car under the “Rover” brand name, and the Safari and the Telcoline pick-up under the Tata brand
name, in the UK, Ireland and other European markets. We will consider entering into similar alliances that could offer us opportunities for growth. While we design most of the parts for our products, these alliances could also extend to alternative
sources for technology for upgraded aggregates and components for our products, if required.    Enhancement of Non-Vehicle Business Revenues. We seek to continue to increase our after- market revenue from sale of replacement parts and services and sale of engineering products such as engines for
marine and industrial applications, castings, forgings, production aids and toolings and fixtures.

Table of Contents
Customer Financing. As financing is increasingly becoming a critical factor in vehicle
purchases with the declining cost of financing and rising aspirations of the consumers in India, we intend to significantly expand our vehicle financing activities to give impetus to our vehicle sales. As part of our efforts to strengthen our
activities in India, we recently entered into a joint marketing arrangement with Tata Finance Ltd., a non-banking finance company, pursuant to which we formed a joint marketing initiative comprised of employees from our Bureau of Hire Purchase and
Credit and the asset financing division of Tata Finance Ltd., to approach the market with a common marketing front under the common brand of Tata Motors Finance. This joint team oversees the sales and marketing operations of the two companies, in
order to align and integrate product and service offerings and business operations, and reduce costs and promote operational efficiency by rationalizing distribution networks, sharing information technology systems and mounting joint treasury
operations.    Leveraging Our Low-Cost Product Development
Capability. We intend to continue to leverage our strength in low cost product development. The development of our Indica passenger car from greenfield to launch for an annual capacity of 150,000 cars at an estimated cost of approximately
Rs.16,848 million has set a benchmark in low cost automobile product development. Our engineering research centre, or ERC, comprises approximately 1,100 engineers who have access to CAD/CAM/CAE workstations and other support such as a crash test
facility, a state-of-the-art hemi-anechoic noise and vibration test chamber, emission testing facilities and modern test tracks. We believe these facilities will help us to upgrade the quality of our products and substantially reduce new product
development costs.    Enhancing capabilities through
adoption of the Tata Business Excellence Model, or TBEM. The Tata Group, of which we are a part, in recognition of their values of “Leadership with Trust”, has articulated a Group Purpose Statement that aims at
improvement in the quality of life through leadership in various sectors of national economic significance. In pursuit of this goal, the Tata Group has decided to adopt and institutionalize an approach that will enable it to drive performance and
attain higher levels of efficiency both in its business and in discharging its social responsibility. Formulation and adoption of the TBEM, which is adapted from the Malcolm Baldrige Model, is being used as a tool for this purpose. The model
essentially aims to nurture the core values and concepts embodied in various focus areas such as leadership, strategic planning, customers, markets and human resources to be translated to operational performance. Our successful adoption and
implementation of this model is expected to ensure that our business in the future can be conducted through a more systematic approach and sustainable processes. This should facilitate robustness in our way of doing business, given the dynamic and
demanding global business environment.    Remaining
Environmentally and Safety Conscious. We are committed to sustaining what we believe to be a leading position in developing products that meet environmental and safety regulations in India earlier than statutorily mandated. Our vehicles are
compliant with all mandated domestic regulations and also meet the more stringent emission and safety regulations in the overseas markets in which they are sold. We will continue to place a strong emphasis on the utilization of clean technologies in
our manufacturing processes, so as to minimize waste products and environmental pollution. We have introduced versions of our vehicles that run using compressed natural gas, or CNG, as fuel to provide environment friendly solutions.    Continuing to Invest in Technology and Technical Skills. We
believe we are one of the most technologically advanced indigenous vehicle manufacturers in India. Over the years, we have enhanced our technological strengths through co-operation with foreign research consultants as well as extensive internal
research and development activities. These technical skills have given us competitive advantage in product design, manufacturing and quality control. We consider technological leadership to be a significant factor in continued success, and therefore
intend to continue to devote significant resources to constantly upgrade our technological base. See “— Research and Development”.

Maintaining Financial Strength. We have generated strong cash flows since fiscal 2002 as a
result of substantial volume growth, cost reduction and prudent working capital management. As a result, we currently maintain substantial investible surplus. This will provide us with flexibility in case of short-term fluctuations of future
cash flows. We have embarked on economic value added, or EVA, driven project evaluation and capital investments to ensure that we may recover our cost of capital in a downturn and earn higher than our cost of capital in the upside years. 
   Leveraging Unified TATA Brand Equity. We
recognize the need for enhancing our brand recognition in highly competitive markets in which we compete with internationally recognized brands. We believe the TATA brand name is associated by Indian customers with reliability, trust and value. We
will continue to promote the TATA brand in India, as well as overseas where we plan to substantially increase our presence.    Automotive Operations    Our revenues from automotive operations were Rs.89,673.9 million and Rs.128,167.1 million in fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively.    We design, manufacture and market a full range of automotive vehicles,
including trucks, pick-ups, buses, utility vehicles and passenger cars. We also manufacture automotive parts, components and accessories for our own use and for resale and provide finance to our customers for purchase of our vehicles.    Our principal product line comprises:

Our share of the total Indian four-wheeled automotive vehicle market in which our products compete was
23.4% and 25.2% in fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively. Please see “– Competition” for a breakdown of our market share by our line of products.    Passenger cars    Our current product line in passenger cars consists of compact and mid-size cars.    Our compact hatchback car, Indica, was first launched in 1998 and an upgraded version V2 was introduced in 2001. At the
AutoExpo in January 2004, Asia’s largest auto show, in Delhi, we launched a facelift of the Indica V2. Available in both diesel and gasoline engine options, it is the country’s largest selling diesel car and is among the three leading
compact car brands overall. In just 25 months from its launch in the market, we sold our 100,000th Indica and by
March 2004, we had sold approximately 325,000 units.    In
December 2002, we entered into an agreement with the MG Rover Group in the United Kingdom for the sale and distribution of the CityRover, an Indica incorporating Rover-specific modifications and meeting European safety and Euro III emission
standards. Shipment of the CityRover commenced in October 2003 and over 6,600 CityRover cars were exported by the end of March 2004.    Based on the Indica platform, we introduced a mid-size sedan, the Indigo, in fiscal 2003. Since its launch, the Indigo has re-defined the customer
price-points in the entry-level sedan market in India and is the highest selling mid-size car in the Indian market. We sold approximately 35,000 units of the Indigo from its launch in December 2002 through March 31, 2004. At the recently concluded
AutoExpo 2004, we unveiled a station wagon version of the Indigo – the Indigo Marina – which we plan to commercially introduce in fiscal 2005.    In fiscal 2004 our domestic market share in passenger cars was 15.5%. All our vehicles in this category conform to Euro I and II emission norms. Euro III

   Engines, Spare Parts and Other
Products    We manufacture spare parts for all models of our
vehicles. We also utilize our spare capacity for manufacturing engines for marine and industrial applications. During fiscal 2003 and 2004, we sold 4,359 and 5,025 of these engines, respectively. Since 2001, Cummins Engine Company, USA has also used
our engines for power generating and industrial applications through its Indian venture, Cummins India Ltd.

Production    Our principal automotive production facilities are located in Pune in Western India, Jamshedpur in Eastern India, and Lucknow in Northern India which
provides us with a good geographical spread to cater to every region in the country. In the Pune plant we make all our products, the plant at Jamshedpur caters to MHCVs, and at Lucknow we assemble commercial and utility vehicles. We also have a MHCV
assembly plant in Gunsan, South Korea.    We produced 223,459 and
311,542 vehicles in India in fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively. In addition, TDCV produced 46 vehicles in fiscal 2004 subsequent to our acquisition of TDCV in late March 2004.    We have been implementing KAIZEN techniques with the assistance of international consultants, with a view to creating a
significant reduction in the through-put time for the various manufacturing activities performed within our plants. KAIZEN techniques are intended to help in optimization of work flows and rationalization of work processes thereby improving system
efficiency.    Sales and Distribution of Vehicles    Our automotive sales distribution network in India is comprised of our 29
regional offices, 36 sub-regional offices and over 400 dealer outlets. We have six company-owned dealerships, including those owned by consolidated subsidiaries, while the rest of the dealers are independent, most of whom are exclusive dealers for
our vehicles. We believe that this is the largest distribution network for automobiles in India. We believe that our distribution network has been a key factor in our success in the domestic market. We deploy different sales channels for the
distribution of our vehicles. In addition to the dealer outlets, we also have a strong after sales service network comprising 550 authorized service centers. We own 3 of these centers.    A substantial number of our vehicles are sold directly to dealers from our regional sales offices. We do not extend credit
to dealers. However, we provide cash incentives to better performing dealers. We sell Government and military vehicles as well as a small number of other vehicles directly to customers.    End-user purchases of our vehicles from dealers are generally financed by third-party sources, including banks, development
financial institutions and private finance companies. Although most end-user financing is provided by third parties, we also provide credit through financing channels to end-user purchasers through our dealers who act as our agents. For fiscal 2003
and 2004, approximately 9% and 8%, respectively, of our vehicle sales were made through hire purchase terms where we provided the credit. These credit sales are made on secured terms with a cash down payment of between 10% to 25% by the purchaser,
followed by monthly installment payments for up to 36 months. Credit provided by us to end-user purchasers is extended on prevailing market terms which are at a margin over our marginal cost of borrowing and cost of operations. Until the final
payment, we retain title to vehicles sold on a credit basis and are entitled to repossess them in case of default in payments. We actively pursue collection of overdue amounts, including through repossession where necessary. Total finance
receivables outstanding as at March 31, 2003 and 2004 amounted to Rs.5,377.5 million and Rs.8,397.0 million, respectively, of which Rs.112.7 million and Rs.120.7 million, respectively, were considered doubtful. We have a contractual 15% recourse to
the relevant dealer for any uncollected amounts.    We have
company-owned sales and service outlets in Bhubaneshwar, Delhi and Mumbai and our consolidated subsidiary, Concorde Motors Ltd., runs dealership operations in Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore. These dealerships have been patterned to meet
international benchmarks and are intended to serve as model dealerships for our other dealers. We have also recently begun operating 24-hour-service

centers and have established a maintenance plan called “Sampoorna Seva”, meaning “complete service”,
pursuant to which we enter into annual maintenance contracts with vehicle owners. We use a network of service centers on highways and a toll free Customer Assistance Centre for providing 24-hour on-road maintenance (including replacement of parts)
to vehicle owners. We believe that the reach of our service and maintenance network provides us with a significant advantage over our competitors.    Competition    We face competition from domestic automotive manufacturers across our product lines. In addition, many foreign automotive manufacturers have increased or
are expected to increase their participation in the Indian market through technology transfers, joint ventures or subsidiaries.    Our vehicles are tailored specifically to the Indian market, catering to specific customer needs such as safety, driving comfort, fuel efficiency and
durability. They are suited to general conditions of Indian roads, the local climate and overloading practices, and are environmentally friendly. We also offer a wide range of optional configurations to meet the needs of our customers. We intend to
upgrade and widen our product range in order to meet the increasing customer expectation of “world class” products. We believe that our extensive research and development activities have been a major contributor to the success of our newer
models. See “Research and Development” below.    We
believe that our extensive distribution reach and our wider product range provide us with a competitive advantage. We have been able to improve our market share in the product categories that we compete in from 20.6% in fiscal 2002 to 23.4% in
fiscal 2003 and to 25.2% in fiscal 2004.    The following table
sets forth, for each of the periods indicated, our domestic market share for each of the categories presented, based on the classification used by and data provided by SIAM in its March 2003 and 2004 Flash Reports on Production and Sales:

Seasonality    Demand for our vehicles is subject to seasonal variations. The peak seasons are between January and March, although there is a dip in February just before
release of the Indian Fiscal Budget, which usually recovers in March after the Budget is announced. Demand is usually lean from April to July and picks up again in September with a dip in December due to the change of the manufacturing year.
   International Business    Substantially all of our manufacturing and sales and distribution facilities
are located in India. In fiscal 2003 and 2004, approximately 95% and 92%, respectively, of our revenues were derived from the domestic market. In fiscal 2004, our export sales increased significantly compared to the comparable prior periods. This
increase was largely as a result of our distribution agreement with MG Rover. Sales under this distribution agreement constituted approximately 30% of our export sales by units and 2.1% of our total sales by units in fiscal 2004. The proportion of
our unit sales outside India during the current fiscal year that will be comprised of sales to MG Rover is expected to be partially offset by sales from TDCV. In addition, we are continuing to pursue other opportunities for expansion of our exports.
   Over the years, we have received more than 50 awards from the
Engineering Export Promotion Council, the Government of India and the State Government of Maharashtra for our export initiatives. Our exports were subdued in fiscal 2003 but grew significantly in fiscal 2004. Our exports of vehicles manufactured in
India decreased 29.6% in fiscal 2003 to 9,809 units from 13,927 units in fiscal 2002 and increased by 125% to 22,046 units in fiscal 2004, the highest we have ever achieved.    The following table shows for the periods indicated, our principal export sales of vehicles manufactured in India by unit
and the break-down, in percentages, of those sales:

   Our primary
international markets for the vehicles we manufacture in India are in Europe, Asia and Africa which, in fiscal 2004, accounted for 49%, 42% and 8%, respectively, of our total export sales of vehicles manufactured in India by units.    In addition, TDCV sold 29 vehicles in fiscal 2004 subsequent to our
acquisition of TDCV on March 30, 2004.    We have established
assembly operations in Bangladesh with one of our affiliates, Nita Co. Ltd., as well as assembly operations that are contracted to distributors in Malaysia, Kenya and South Africa. In our traditional export markets of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, our
MCVs continue to enjoy a significant market share. We have been concentrating our efforts on increasing our presence in the newer markets we have entered in the last few years, while at the same time improving our sales in our existing overseas
markets.    We distribute vehicles in international markets
through a network of distributors. These distributors in turn appoint local dealers who are familiar with the local market conditions in their respective countries.   
31 


Table of Contents
We have also stationed overseas resident sales and service representatives in various countries to oversee our operations
in their respective territories. The dealers appointed in various countries are responsible for the after-sales service needs of the local customers. We have recently undertaken initiatives to enhance the penetration and reach of our international
business through expansion of our sales and service network in our international markets.    In order to enhance our exports, we entered into an agreement with the MG Rover Group for the sale and distribution of the Indica, the Safari and the Telcoline pick-up in the United Kingdom, Ireland and other European
markets, as well as for the sale and distribution of spare parts for these vehicles in these markets. Pursuant to this agreement, we supply Indicas for sale under the Rover brand name CityRover in these markets, and Safaris and Telcoline pick-ups
marketed as Tata vehicles, thereby gaining access to significant new export markets and an established network of overseas dealers. We have agreed not to separately export Indicas or comparable vehicles, Safaris or Telcoline pick-ups to the United
Kingdom and Ireland that would compete with the vehicles to be sold and distributed by MG Rover Group for the duration of our agreement. The agreement is expected to improve output at our plants, thereby improving our efficiencies. The first
shipment of the CityRover commenced in October 2003.    We
distribute vehicles in South Korea through Daewoo Motor Sales Corporation, or DMSC, and the international sales of TDCV are through Daewoo International, Daewoo Construction and through our international vehicle distribution channel. We also have 38
service centers and distribute parts through 60 outlets in South Korea.    Acquisition of Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd., Korea    We acquired Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd., or DWCV (now named Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd., or TDCV), on March 30, 2004. DWCV, the former truck unit of Daewoo Motor Company, or DMC, was established in
November 2002 under a corporate reorganization plan after DMC went bankrupt. TDCV currently manufactures heavy commercial vehicles with a gross combined weight ranging from 15 to 45 metric tonnes in cargo, mixers, dump truck and tractor applications
as well as some special purpose vehicles with engines ranging from 215HP to 400HP. This product range is complementary to our current product range powered by engines with a maximum of 210HP. The total acquisition price of KRW 120.642 billion
(approximately Rs.4,650 million or US$102 million) was financed equally through our equity investment in TDCV and direct lending facilities to TDCV, for which we provided a letter of undertaking. The price includes the perpetual and exclusive right
to use Daewoo trademarks in Korea and overseas markets for the product range of TDCV. We believe that significant synergies can be achieved with TDCV in a number of areas, including marketing, product range, research and product development, and
some operational areas.    Research and Development    Our research and development activities in our automotive business segment
focus on the environment, vehicle safety, and product development. Through our Engineering Research Centre, or ERC, which is one of the few Government recognized in-house automotive research and development centers in the country, we have been able
to design, develop and manufacture our own range of vehicles. The most significant achievement of the ERC to date has been the design and development of our compact car, the Indica, which is the country’s only indigenous offering. The ERC also
designed our mid-size car, the Indigo, which was introduced in December 2002 and has since retained leadership in the mid-size market segment in India. We enhanced our strong position in the Indian commercial vehicle market through the introduction
of a new improved range of EX series light, medium and heavy trucks and buses as well as a newly launched pick-up in fiscal 2003. We are currently working on a global truck of the future that will enable us to achieve our objective of providing
transportation solutions globally. Our acquisition of DWCV is expected to provide us synergies in the development of this global truck. We are also working on the development of a low cost car for the Indian market.   
32 


Table of Contents
Some of the development facilities used by our ERC are unique to the Indian auto industry. We are the
only automotive company in Asia outside of Japan and Korea that has a modern crash test facility where new products are thoroughly tested for ensuring enhanced passenger safety. Our ERC also has a hemi-anechoic chamber testing facility to minimize
noise and vibration levels in vehicles and engine emission testing facilities to develop environmentally friendly products.    Our ERC functions in a state-of-the-art computer-aided design, or CAD, manufacturing environment. Engineers using CAD systems are able to develop new
vehicle models and also bring about improvements in existing vehicles and components. New tools are also designed using our CAD systems and all of these design functions are electronically linked to component and tooling facilities for cutting body
panel dies and making other structural components. Our subsidiary Tata Technologies Limited has also developed software for various automotive and other applications, which is used for our own applications and is also sold to third parties such as
IBM, General Motors and DaimlerChrysler.    Our ERC employs about
1,100 persons. Over the years, we have devoted considerable resources towards our research and development activities. Our total expenditure on research and development during fiscal years 2002, 2003 and 2004 was Rs.1,214.4 million, Rs.1,536.2
million and Rs.1,282 million, respectively. Our in-house research and development initiative has received wide acclaim and recognition. For the year 1999, we received the National Award for research and development efforts in Industry in the
Mechanical Engineering Industries Sector from the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India, which covered our achievements for the design and development of the Indica. For the year 2000, we received from the Technology
Development Board of the Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, the National Award for Successful Commercialization of Indigenous Technology by an Industrial Concern for the Tata Indica project. We received the CSIR (Centre for
Scientific and Industrial Research) Diamond Jubilee Technology Award for the development of the Indica and the Business World – NID design Excellence Award for the design, development and production of the Indica in fiscal 2004. The ICICI Bank
and Overdrive Awards 2003 voted the Indigo as the “Most Exciting New Car in 2002”, and the Indica was voted the “Best Diesel Small Car” in the Voice of the Customer Awards by NFO Automotive India 2002.    Intellectual Property    We have 39 trademarks registered in India and approximately 137 trademark applications which are currently pending. In
addition to this, our significant trademarks are registered, or are in the process of being registered, in nearly 115 countries worldwide. We currently hold approximately 726 of these registrations worldwide. The registrations mainly include
trademarks for each of our vehicle models. Further, we also use the “Tata” brand which has been licensed to us by Tata Sons Limited. See “—The Tata Group”. As part of our acquisition of Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd., we
have the perpetual and exclusive use of the “Daewoo” brand and trademarks in Korea and overseas markets for the product range of TDCV. TDCV holds South Korean trademark registrations for 14 utility models and five designs.    India is a member of the World Trade Organization. In compliance with its
obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property, or TRIPS, India grants statutory protection to various forms of intellectual property, including patents, copyrights, industrial designs and trademarks. The Trade
Marks Act, 1999 and the Copyright Act, 1957, as amended, which are currently in force in India, are TRIPS compliant. The Patents Act, 1970, as amended, to the extent that it relates to our business and operations, provides adequate product and
process patent protection in India in accordance with its obligations under TRIPS. The United States has placed India on its “priority watch list” under Section 301 of   
33 


Table of Contents
TRIPS for failing to provide adequate levels of protection for intellectual property rights. Although we have never
experienced any material difficulties in protecting our brands and other intellectual property in India, the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in India has not been and may not be as effective as in the United States.
   We currently own two patents and have 13 patent applications
pending registration in India. These patents are mostly in relation to devices which enable efficient functioning, such as energy saving devices. Our most significant patent, which is currently in the process of being registered, is a portable
device for measurement of head impact points in a vehicle. In addition, TDCV holds 9 patents in South Korea and 2 patent applications are currently pending registration.    In addition to the above we also have various copyright and Internet domain name registrations.    Although we consider our intellectual property to be important, we do not
consider any one or group of our trademarks, brands or patents to be so important that their expiration or termination would materially affect our business.    Other Operations    In addition to automotive operations, we are involved in a number of other business activities. Net revenues for these activities totaled Rs.6,056.6
million and Rs.11,528.6 million in fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively, representing approximately 6.3% and 8.3%, respectively, of our total revenues. The most significant of our other operations are information technology services, auto components
and construction equipment.    Construction
Equipment    Telco Construction Equipment Co.
Ltd., an 80%-owned subsidiary that is a joint venture with Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd., Japan, which holds the remaining 20%, makes construction and related equipment such as cranes, hydraulic excavators, loaders, and articulated dump
trucks.    Information Technology
Services    Tata Technologies Ltd., or TTL, our
95.38%-owned subsidiary provides information technology services to several clients across India and overseas on its own, as well as through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tata Technologies, USA. TTL has implemented the SAP Enterprise Resource
Planning, or SAP ERP, system across Tata Motors and several other companies.    Auto Components    Our subsidiary, Tata AutoComp Systems Ltd. promotes auto component joint ventures with global component manufacturers. In addition, our wholly-owned subsidiaries, HV Axles Ltd. and HV Transmissions Ltd., manufacture
heavy axles and heavy transmissions primarily for our own requirements.    Components and Raw Materials    Our vehicles
manufactured in India are manufactured almost entirely from components made in India, a large proportion of which are sourced from a well-established network of suppliers, many of whom have invested in the most advanced component technologies
available. We import only a limited number of specialized parts and components and specialized grades of steel. Our Korean-manufactured vehicles at TDCV are assembled primarily from Korea-manufactured aggregates and components, although some of the
major aggregates are also imported from U.S. and European component suppliers.

Table of Contents
We have recently undertaken an e-commerce initiative through the development of a business-to-business
site with the assistance of our subsidiary, Tata Technologies Limited, for electronic interchange of data with our suppliers. This has enabled us to have real time information exchange/processing through which we effectively manage our supply chain.
We have also engaged the services of external agencies that operate as third party logistic providers. This has resulted in space and cost saving by transferring a part of our inventory to a third party.    The principal raw materials and components required by us for use in our
vehicles are steel sheets and plates, castings, forgings, proprietary items such as tyres, batteries, electrical items and rubber and plastic parts. The raw materials, components and consumables that are domestically sourced include steel
(sheet-metal, forgings and castings), tyres and tubes, batteries, fuel injection systems, air-oil filters, consumables (paints, oils, thinner, welding consumables, chemicals, adhesives and sealants) and fuels. We also require aggregates like axles,
engines, gear boxes and cabs for our vehicles, which are manufactured by our subsidiaries or purchased from our affiliates.    As part of our strategy to become a low-cost vehicle manufacturer, we have undertaken various initiatives to reduce our fixed and variable costs including
an e-sourcing initiative started in 2002 through which we have taken up reverse auctions. We have established a procedure for ensuring quality control of outsourced components. Purchases that are made from approved sources undergo a comprehensive
13-step supplier quality improvement process. We also have a program for assisting vendors from whom we purchase raw materials or components to maintain quality. Each vendor is reviewed on a quarterly basis on parameters of quality, cost and
delivery. Preference is given to vendors with QS-9000 certification. We also maintain a stringent quality assurance program that includes random testing of production samples, frequent re-calibration of production equipment and analysis of
post-production vehicle performance and ongoing dialogue with workers to reduce production errors. Further, in April 2003, we established a Strategic Sourcing Group to consolidate, strategize and monitor our supply chain activities with respect to
major items of purchase as well as major inputs of technology and services. The Strategic Sourcing Group is responsible for recommending for the approval of the Management Committee, the long-term strategy and purchase decision for these items,
negotiation and relationship with vendors with regard to these items, formulating and overseeing our purchasing policies, norms in respect of all items, evolving guidelines for vendor quality improvement, vendor rating and performance monitoring and
undertaking company-wide initiatives such as e-sourcing and supply chain management/policies with respect to vehicle spare parts. We are also exploring opportunities for global sourcing of parts and components from lower cost countries, and have
embarked on a vendor management program that includes vendor base rationalization, vendor quality improvement and vendor satisfaction surveys.    Domestic Suppliers    We have chosen to outsource manufacturing of many components. In these instances we have been actively involved in providing training to outside suppliers
and we often design and manufacture the toolings and fixtures employed by those suppliers.    Tata AutoComp Systems, Ltd. encourages the entry of internationally acclaimed auto component manufacturers into India by setting up joint ventures with them. Some of these joint ventures include: Tata Johnson Controls
for seats, Knorr Bremse Systems for commercial vehicle air brakes, Tata Yazaki for wiring harnesses, JBM Sangwoo for pressed components, Tata Auto Plastics for plastic components and Tata Toyo Radiators for radiator assemblies. These joint ventures
act as our suppliers.

Foreign Suppliers    We import some components that are either not available in the domestic market or when equivalent domestically-available components do not meet our
quality standards. Imported components include those that are required to be fitted on vehicles manufactured for export markets to meet foreign regulations, such as air intake valves, fog lamps and also for MPFI kits/catalytic converters to meet the
Euro II norms. We also import products to take advantage of lower prices in foreign markets, such as special steels.    The following table shows the imported and indigenous raw material and components consumed by us for the periods indicated:

   Capital and Product Development
Expenditures    Our total capital expenditure between April
1, 2002 and March 31, 2004 has been Rs.5,309.9 million. This has been incurred primarily for investment in and sustenance of manufacturing facilities and new technology for new products and model changes. On a segmental basis, automotive operations
accounted for Rs.4,288.5 million of this expenditure while Rs.1,021.4 million was incurred in other operations. We also invested Rs.2,462.5 million in fiscal 2004 in connection with our acquisition of DWCV in South Korea.    We intend to incur capital expenditures of approximately Rs.51,800 million
between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2007 primarily for sustenance of manufacturing facilities, for new products and model changes and also for capacity expansion. Specifically, we currently intend to incur capital expenditures of approximately
Rs.13,900 million on capacity expansion at our India-based automotive plants, and approximately Rs.19,000 million for investment in new vehicle and models and upgrades. The source of funding for this capital expenditure program will be mainly
through internally generated cash from operations and funds raised through our July 2003 and April 2004 issuances of convertible notes and the conversion of warrants pursuant to our December 2002 rights issuance of convertible and non-convertible
debentures.    Environmental Regulation and Initiatives    Regulation    Our vehicles comply with the fuel emission regulations in India that came
into effect in 1989. We are currently taking steps (including through the use of Cummins engines for our MHCVs and the development of gasoline engines) that will enable our vehicles to comply with fuel emission regulations expected to be introduced
in the future.    New vehicles manufactured by us are required to
obtain certificates of compliance with various vehicle safety regulations relating to design and the manufacturing process. Fuel emission levels are also

tested at this stage. Each of our plants has received government environmental clearances for our operations. It is our
policy to consider and implement environmentally-friendly manufacturing processes, and waste water and other by-products from our plants are treated and recycled to the extent which we consider practicable.    Initiatives    We are fully committed to our role as a responsible corporate citizen with
respect to reducing environmental pollution. We treat all effluents at our plants and have made significant investments in lowering the emissions from our products. We have led the Indian automotive industry in introducing greener engines, like the
Cummins engines, for our commercial vehicles even before they were statutorily mandated. The entire range of our MCVs manufactured in India has been configured to run on Cummins engines or the upgraded version of our own engines that meet mandatory
emission norms in India. Our LCVs are powered by our own engines that meet mandated norms. In addition, buses with lean-burn as well as stoichiometric compressed natural gas, or CNG, engines have been developed and supplied to Delhi Transport
Corporation and private bus operators in Delhi so as to enable them to comply with the regulations there. Our utility vehicles and passenger cars being exported to Europe meet the Euro III norms prevalent in those markets. In the Indian market these
vehicles comply with the Bharat Stage II (Euro II equivalent) norms. The diesel version, as well as the multi-point fuel injection, or MPFI, petrol engine version of the Indica, also meets the Euro II norms and other regulatory and market
requirements in Europe. While our entire range of vehicles comfortably meets the requisite emission norms, we are currently exploring various options to develop or source Euro III compliant engines for our Indian operations. We have also launched
Indicas powered by CNG in Delhi and Mumbai, primarily for the taxi segment. We believe that we are fully able to meet the challenges posed by increasingly stringent emission norms.    The vehicles made by TDCV comply with the emission regulatory requirements in that country. The Korea 2004 (equivalent to
Euro III) emission regulatory requirements became effective on July 1, 2004 and since that date the vehicles made by TDCV have conformed to those regulations.   
Insurance Coverage    The Indian insurance industry is predominantly state-owned. Insurance tariffs are regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. We have
insurance coverage which we consider reasonably sufficient to cover all normal risks associated with our operations and which we believe is in accordance with industry standards in India. We have obtained coverage for product liability for some of
our vehicle models in several countries to which we export vehicles. We do not at present maintain business interruption insurance or product liability insurance in India.    TDCV has insurance coverage as is required and applicable to cover all normal risks in accordance with industry standards in
South Korea, including for product liability.    Legal Proceedings
   We are involved in legal proceedings in various states in
India, both as plaintiff and as defendant. In respect of claims against us below Rs.50 million, the majority of the cases pertain to motor accident tribunal claims (with respect to accidents involving our vehicles while being transferred from our
plants to regional sales offices or between two regional sales offices) and consumer complaints, some of these cases relate to replacement of parts of vehicles and/or compensation for deficiency in the services provided by us or our dealers. We
believe that none of these claims or actions individually or in the aggregate, or any settlement amounts in respect thereof, will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.   
37 


Table of Contents
We are also defending other claims filed against us that are above Rs.50 million in asserted or claimed
value but which we do not believe to be of a material nature, other than those claims described below.    A summary of litigation and disputes in which we are involved which may be regarded as material, is as follows:    Income Tax    We have ongoing disputes with Indian tax authorities relating to the tax
treatment of certain items. These primarily include disallowed expenses, the tax treatment of certain expenses claimed by us as deductions and the computation of, or eligibility for, certain tax incentives or allowances. Some of the disputes relate
to timing and, as such, disallowances in one period would be claimable in subsequent periods. Most of these disputes and disallowances, being repetitive in nature, have been raised by the income tax authorities in most of our open tax years. We have
a right of appeal to the appellate authorities against adverse initial assessments and further to the High Court or the Supreme Court on matters involving a question of law. The income tax authorities have similar rights of appeal.    As of March 31, 2004, income tax deductions aggregating Rs.672.5 million have
been disallowed by the income tax authorities, which are being contested by us on appeal. There are further income tax liabilities amounting to Rs.630 million in respect of which we have won appeals that have been further contested by the income tax
authorities before higher appellate authorities.    Excise
Duty    As of March 31, 2004, we were a party to pending
litigation with respect to excise duty demands aggregating Rs.446 million, challenging the basis of our valuation of our products and the applicability of ‘Central value added tax’, or CENVAT, on inputs.    Of the Rs.446 million of excise duty demands as of March 31, 2004, Rs.190.0
million relate to demands by the excise authorities where we have prevailed on appeals that have been further contested by the excise authorities.    The excise authorities have demanded Rs.22.3 million challenging the basis of our assessment of the value of certain vehicles. The tribunal has decided
the issue against the us, in respect of which we have filed an appeal before the Supreme Court. We expect this to be finally decided in our favor.    The excise authorities have demanded Rs.81.1 million of excise duty arising from an amendment to the Central Excise Rules in 1995 concerning utilization
of modified value added tax credit. The case is pending before the tribunal. We believe that we have rightfully claimed this credit.    In fiscal 2004 there was a significant decline in excise duty demands. Rs.3,088.8 million of demands raised by the excise authorities challenging the
basis of assessable value determined by us was decided in our favor by the Central Excise and Service tax Tribunal. The time for raising further appeal by the excise authorities in the Supreme Court has elapsed, and these no longer considered
contingent liabilities.    The excise authorities have denied us
credit of Rs.47.0 million on certain accessories supplied with our vehicles. We are contesting this before the appellate authorities and expect to receive a favorable response.

Table of Contents
Sales tax    Total sales tax demands (including interest and penalty) being contested by us amounted to Rs.2,443.1 million as of March
31, 2004. A summary of the major demands being contested by us is as follows:    Our affiliate Tata Cummins Limited, or TCL, which manufactures internal combustion engines and sells them principally to us, had claimed an exemption from the sales tax on finished products and from the purchase tax
on raw materials, being an incentive given by state tax authorities to new industries set up in specified area. TCL had passed on this benefit to us. This exemption was denied to TCL by the sales tax authorities. TCL’s claim has been upheld by
the High Court in August 2003. An appeal filed by the state against this decision before the Supreme Court is pending. The amount involved is Rs.1,169 million. If TCL ultimately does not prevail, we would be liable to reimburse TCL for the benefit
that was passed to us.    Different rates of sales tax are
applicable on sales of vehicles in different states in India. We are currently disputing the imposition of sales tax levies by the sales tax authorities in certain states aggregating approximately Rs.658.5 million, which are based on claims that
stock transfers of vehicles from our plants to our sales offices and transfers between two sales offices are inter-state sales and therefore liable to sales tax.    The sales tax authorities at Patna have raised sales tax demands of Rs.188.5 million. We have filed appeals against the
order before the appellate authorities.    Under a notification
issued by the Jaipur State Government, vehicles having gross weight of more than 8,000 kgs. are classified for a certain tax rate. The Jaipur sales tax authorities have raised a demand of Rs.120.6 million claiming that our vehicles with a bare
chassis weight of less than 8,000 kgs do not fall under this tax classification.    Other sales tax cases where sales tax authorities have raised demands aggregating Rs.306.5 million mostly relate to alleged non-compliance with certain procedural requirements, such as non-submission of declaration
forms. We have since collected the required forms from customers and submitted those forms to the relevant authorities.    Other taxes and dues    Other amounts for which we may be liable contingently aggregate 1,218.5 million, including those described below.    Municipal authorities in certain states levy octroi duty, a local tax, on
goods brought inside municipal limits at rates that are based on the classification of those goods. A demand of Rs.533.9 million is currently pending before the High Court in connection with the levying of higher octroi duties claimed on account of
classification disputes relating to components purchased by us for the manufacture of our vehicles.    In addition to the above claims, there is a pending counter claim for approximately £4.4 million, by Motor Vehicles Industries Ltd., or MVI, in
connection with legal proceedings brought by us and Tata International Limited, Mumbai in respect of alleged breaches of a distributorship arrangement. Motor Vehicles Industries Ltd. is currently in administration and, accordingly, this litigation
has been suspended. Recently, the Leeds District Registry has passed an order in our favor and has initiated proceedings to wind up MVI.    Considering the nature of these claims, we believe that none of the claims or proceedings will materially adversely affect our business or financial
condition.

Regulation    Indian Automotive Sector    India’s automotive industry was established in the 1950s through various co-operation arrangements with, and direct investments by, a number of
American and European automotive manufacturers. Prior to that, vehicle kits were imported into and assembled in India. The commercial vehicle manufacturing sector achieved a high rate of growth during India’s economic expansion in the 1960s and
1970s. Rail transport bottlenecks led to higher demand for road transport and this sector was permitted to grow with the minimum intervention of the Government. Major domestic commercial vehicle manufacturers invested in expanding production
facilities and product development, which resulted in an efficient and relatively technologically advanced commercial vehicle industry, albeit with restrictions on capacity expansions due to the licensing regime in operation at that time.
   In the passenger car sector, two models produced by Hindustan
Motors Limited and Premier Automobiles Limited, respectively, dominated the market until the mid 1980s. Passenger cars were deemed to be luxury products and were subject to very high multiple taxation and price controls. In addition, industrial
licensing and exchange control regulations forced domestic car manufacturers to embark on low-volume, high-cost indigenous and in-house component production programs. Demand for passenger cars exceeded supply, but the domestic passenger car industry
remained protected by the prohibition on car imports and remained technologically backward. However, the establishment of Maruti Udyog Limited, or Maruti, a joint venture between the Suzuki Motor Company of Japan and the Government of India in the
mid-1980s paved the way for expansion of the automobile sector in India in terms of increase in supply and improvement in product quality and design. Maruti has since become the leading player in the Indian passenger car market. It was not until the
Indian Government deregulated and liberalized the automotive market in the early 1990s that the country’s passenger car market showed substantial growth. Nonetheless, India continues to have a substantially lower number of passenger vehicles
per capita than most developed countries and a number of developing countries.    Restrictive automotive vehicle import policies and high import duties on vehicles assembled from kits as well as vehicle components have effectively protected domestic manufacturers from foreign competition. Although
the Indian Government has reduced import duties on vehicles and components in recent years, rates still remain relatively high. See “Import Regulations and Duties” below. Consequently, domestic manufacturers have historically dominated the
automotive industry in India, although a number of domestic manufacturers have sought to improve product quality by entering into joint ventures, technology transfer agreements or licensing agreements with foreign vehicle and component
manufacturers.    The industry has, historically, also been
subject to high excise duty rates, and even today cars and UVs are subject to the highest excise rates. Fluctuations in these taxes directly impact retail sales prices and, consequently, the level of demand. Sales Tax in various states has been
recently rationalized. See “Excise Duty and Sales Tax” below.    Unlike more developed countries, the automotive industry in India until the late 1980’s, had not been subject to stringent emission or vehicle safety regulations, but this trend is changing with Bharat Stage II (equivalent to Euro II)
emissions norms now in force in major cities. See “Government Regulations” below.    Due to the absence of any laws regarding the age of vehicles (except in the National Capital Region, or NCR, of Delhi and the State of Maharashtra), automotive (both commercial as well as passenger) vehicles in India
are typically kept in use much longer than in more developed countries. Commercial vehicles are also subject to overload abuse. This has resulted in the development of an extensive allied industry that is dedicated to providing automotive repair and
maintenance services required for maintaining old and overloaded vehicles. Some manufacturers, including us, have also developed a network of service centers for their vehicles.

In the period since 1980, India’s automotive industry has experienced rapid structural
transformation and growth. Progressive easing of import controls, reduction in governmental restrictions on product categories and the rationalization of excise duties (including the introduction of modified value added tax, or MODVAT, earlier and
central value added tax, or CENVAT, from the year 2000-01), together with increased foreign investment and technical assistance has helped create a wider range of products and greater competition. The passenger vehicle segment has experienced the
maximum growth over the last few years with almost all foreign direct investment in the automobile industry directed to this segment.    According to SIAM, Indian automotive manufactures sold, in the domestic and export markets, approximately 106,000 vehicles (MHCVs, LCVs, UVs and passenger
cars) in 1980. This tripled to approximately 355,000 vehicles in the year ended March 31, 1991 and rose over twelve-fold to approximately 1,308,000 vehicles in the year ended March 31, 2004.    The global automotive industry has undergone radical change in recent times.
There has been significant consolidation, both amongst vehicle manufacturers and component vendors with a view to achieving economies of scale, product synergies and strong brand presence. By contrast, there has been little or no consolidation in
either vehicle or component manufacturing in India. The sizes of domestic automotive manufacturers, especially for passenger vehicles, are small compared to global standards. Consequently, economies of scale manufacturing have generally eluded
Indian manufacturers of automotive vehicles and automotive components. The component industry, which until recently was to a large extent reserved for the small-scale sector, continues to be fragmented, with a number of enterprises starved of funds
and technology, though this situation has improved in recent years. The Indian automotive industry has, therefore, differed from the global model, but as entry barriers in India are removed, both vehicle and component manufacturers are likely to
consolidate their operations to achieve the levels of competitiveness and scale economies that exist globally. Globally renowned branded products, supported by high levels of promotional spending, are likely to win a significant share of the
domestic market for all vehicles, particularly passenger vehicles. Indian manufacturers will, therefore, need to either offer products and services that differentiate themselves in mass markets, or confine themselves to a niche market. 
  The Indian automotive industry is poised to undergo substantial change and
face new challenges, both from the opening of the domestic market to imports and the entry of international manufacturers. To meet the needs of these changing times, domestic automotive manufacturers will be forced to reduce costs, improve
productivity, enhance quality, reliability and durability, increase market orientation and create a high level of customer loyalty. Consequently, the reach and extent of dealership networks and the quality and cost of service are likely to assume
paramount importance in influencing customer preferences.    Driving conditions in India are generally rugged due to the poor quality of road infrastructure. This has hindered the expansion of the road transport sector and, consequently, the automotive industry. The Government is taking steps to
improve the road infrastructure in the country. The outlay of road and highway development is proceeding to plan and India is expected to have an improved road infrastructure with the feeder routes in place by 2007, which may increase demand for
automotive vehicles in India.    Union Budget for Fiscal 2005 
  The Government of India presented its Union Budget for 2004-2005 on July
8, 2004. Some of the proposals that may have an impact on our operations include:   


 
(a)
2% education cess imposed on all direct and indirect taxes. While the CENVAT credit is allowable on the cess on indirect taxes, no such credit is applicable on direct taxes which
would result in an additional tax burden.   
41 


Table of Contents


 
(b)
Service tax rates have been increased from 8% to 10%. However, the CENVAT credit has now been made applicable to service taxes.   


 
(c)
The automotive industry has been added to the list of industries wherein a 150% weighted deduction on expenditures on in-house research and development is allowed.
  


 
(d)
An additional 10% depreciation is allowed for capacity expansion of 10% as compared to the previous 25%.   


 
(e)
The import duty on steel input has been reduced from 20% to 15%, while the excise duty on steel and steel products has been increased from 8% to 12%.   


 
(f)
Based on the recommendations of the State Finance Minister’s Committee on VAT implementation, VAT will be implemented across the country from April 1, 2005.
   Due to the imposition of the education cess,
which became effective on July 9, 2004, we have passed on this increase to the end customer.    Excise Duty and Sales Tax    Excise duty is payable by vehicle manufacturers on the manufacture of vehicles or parts in India, and is paid at the time of clearance from the manufacturing facilities. Excise duty rates vary according to vehicle classification and for us
are levied as a percentage of the net dealer price at the time of dispatch of the vehicle from the plant/depot. The rates of excise duty directly impact the retail sales price and the introduction of significant changes in rates overall or
differential classifications of products can materially impact sales in general or sales of specific models that attract higher rates of excise. Manufacturers receive a credit for excise duties, called CENVAT, including countervailing duties paid on
imports included in the price paid for raw materials, parts or components obtained from outside sources or other plants and used in manufacture of the finished product. Such a credit is offset against the CENVAT payable on the finished product.
CENVAT credit is also available to manufacturers on purchase of plant and machinery.    The following table sets forth the excise duty classifications and rates applicable to our vehicles. These rates became effective from July 9, 2004.

Table of Contents
No excise duty is payable with respect to vehicles imported into India. However, sales tax is imposed on
the resale of these vehicles and import duties (including countervailing duties) are also levied.    The sale of vehicles in India also attracts sales tax and other levies, a substantial portion of which is paid to the government of the State in which the
sale occurs. Until recently, the rates varied from 3% to 6% in a majority of the States. However, at the instance of the Indian Government, all the States have adopted a uniform rate of 12% applicable to “luxury” goods. This has increased
the rate of sales tax levy by 6% to 9% in most States as against the earlier prevailing rates.    Import Regulations and Duties    Automobiles and automotive components can, generally, be imported into India without a license from the Indian Government. Automobile imports are subject to regulations requiring the importers to meet Indian standards and certification by
designated testing agencies, and are also governed by other restrictions. However, all vehicles and components imported into India are subject to import duties, which significantly increase the cost of imported goods. While recent government
liberalization policies have reduced import duties on vehicles and certain automotive parts and components, duty rates remain relatively high and protect the domestic industry.    The following table sets forth the currently applicable duty rates on fully built-up vehicles, which became effective on
July 9, 2004.

   The import of cars in
completely built unit, or CBU, or completely/semi-knocked down vehicle, or CKD/SKD, form was subject to certain restrictions prior to April 2001. With effect from April 1, 2001, the Indian Government removed the restrictions regarding the import of
vehicles, but imposed conditions for their import. The conditions provide that only right hand drive vehicles with speedometers and headlamps to suit “keep left” traffic and conforming to the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 can be imported, and
only through specified ports. The conditions also stipulate that imported pre-owned vehicles should not exceed three years vintage.    Government Regulations    Prior to 1984, strict government industrial licensing controls restricted the types of vehicles that manufacturers could produce and sell. These
restrictions were reflected in the industry’s characteristic of low product differentiation, with few companies producing a wide range of vehicle types. In 1984, the Indian Government eased these product category restrictions, thereby enabling
us and other automotive manufacturers to produce any on-road vehicle having four or more wheels within each of these manufacturer’s licensed capacity and the normal flexibility allowed for expansion. In addition, as part of the Indian
Government’s liberalization policies announced in1991, industrial licensing has been replaced by the filing of an Industrial Entrepreneurs’ Memorandum (except under locational or environmental restrictions where industrial licensing
continues to operate) and import duties on vehicle components have been substantially reduced. These measures have led to increased competition in the domestic market. With the removal of these controls, except in some situations as explained
earlier, Indian automotive manufacturers are now free to manufacture and sell unrestricted numbers of any type of on-road vehicle with four or more wheels, including passenger cars.

Since 1989, emission standards have also been developing. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has
mandated applicability of emission norms to the automotive industry. These extend from the Bharat Stage I norms (equivalent to Euro I norms) and the Bharat Stage II norms (equivalent to Euro II norms), which have already been mandated, to Euro III
and Euro IV equivalents for which notifications, based on industry recommendations proposed through SIAM, are now awaited. During 2000, passenger vehicles and commercial vehicles were required to meet Bharat Stage I (Euro I equivalent norms). Bharat
Stage II (Euro II equivalent norms) have been in force since 2001 in the four metros of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata, are now applicable to seven other cities and are expected to be extended in phases to the rest of the country by April 2005.
Based on SIAM recommendations and the R.A. Mashelkar Committee Report, these eleven cities could move to Euro III emissions for all passenger and commercial vehicles from April 2005 and to Euro IV levels from April 2010 while the rest of India would
move to Euro III norms by April 2010. The higher stage norms are less pollutive and stricter as compared to lower stage norms.    The South Korean automotive market has adopted the Euro III equivalent emission levels from July 2004. South Korea is expected to migrate to Euro IV
equivalent emission norms in 2006 and Euro V from 2008.    Prior
to April 2002, the Indian Government used the Administered Price Mechanism, or APM, to fix prices of petroleum products, which resulted in the price of diesel being approximately two-thirds the price of gasoline. With the dismantling of the APM
regime, prices of petroleum products have become market driven, which has narrowed the price gap between diesel and gasoline. Our MHCVs and LCVs have diesel engines while our passenger cars and UVs are available in both diesel and gasoline versions.
   Automotive design and safety regulations are evolving in
India. Front and rear seat belts are now mandatory in new passenger vehicles, safety glass is required for all vehicle windows and windshields and standards for door intrusion are imposed for vehicle integrity. Legislation, in line with European
standards, in respect of seats, head restraints, seat anchorage and electromagnetic interference is also expected to be progressively introduced. Legislation for provision of survival space, braking systems, and rear and side underrun protection
devices for commercial vehicles became effective from May 1, 2003. Advance braking system legislation in conformity with European Economic Community standards is being considered for progressive implementation between 2004 and 2007.    In fiscal 2002, the Indian Government released its proposed Auto Policy for
discussion and feedback. This policy outlines a vision to establish a globally competitive automobile industry in India, and to double its contribution to the economy by 2010. It also aims to promote integrated, phased, enduring and self-sustaining
growth of the Indian automotive industry. The stated policy objectives are to:   


 
•
Promote the sector as a lever of industrial growth and employment and to achieve a high degree of value addition in the country;   


 
•
Promote a globally competitive automotive industry and emerge as a global source for auto components;   


 
•
Establish an international hub for manufacturing small, affordable passenger cars and a key center for manufacturing tractors and two-wheel vehicles in the world;
  


 
•
Ensure a balanced transition to open trade at a minimal risk to the Indian economy and local industry;

Develop domestic safety and environmental standards to be at par with international standards.    C. Organizational Structure.    The Tata Group    We are the largest company in the diversified Tata Group in terms of fiscal 2004 revenues, and we benefit from being identified with the Tata brand and
the Tata Group of companies.    The Tata Group is based largely
in India, and had combined revenues of approximately Rs.615.2 billion (US$13.4 billion) for the year ended March 31, 2004.    The Tata Group is highly diversified and the activities of the group are categorized under seven business sectors, namely engineering, materials, energy,
chemicals, consumer products, services and communication and information systems. These companies do not technically constitute a group under Indian law.    The Tata Group has its origins in the trading business founded by Jamsetji Tata in 1874 that was developed and expanded in furtherance of his ideals by
his two sons, Sir Dorabji Tata and Sir Ratan Tata, following their father’s death in 1904. The family interests subsequently vested largely in the Sir Ratan Tata Trust, the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and related trusts. These trusts were
established for philanthropic and charitable purposes and together owned a substantial majority of the shares of Tata Sons Limited, the principal holding company of the Tata Group.    By 1970, the Tata Group had expanded from the trading company established in the nineteenth century to encompass a number of
major industrial and commercial enterprises including The Indian Hotels Company Limited (1902), The Tata Iron and Steel Company Limited (Tata Steel) (1907), The Tata Power Company Limited (1910), Tata Chemicals Limited (1939), Tata Motors Limited
(1945), Voltas Limited (1954), and Tata Tea Limited (1962). The Tata Group also promoted India’s first airline, Tata Airlines, which later became Air India (India’s national carrier), as well as India’s largest general insurance
company, New India Assurance Company Limited, both of which were subsequently taken over by the Government as part of the Government’s nationalization program. Tata Consultancy Services, or TCS, is Asia’s leading software services provider
and the first Indian software firm to exceed sales of US$1 billion. In recent times, the Tata Group has also invested in several telephony and telecommunication ventures, including acquiring a portion of the Indian Government’s equity stake in
the state owned Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited, or VSNL.    Most of
the Tata Group companies are leaders in their respective business segments. We are the leading automotive vehicle manufacturing company in India in terms of revenues. Tata Steel, another flagship company of the group, is the oldest and the largest
private sector integrated steel plant in operation in the country. Tata Chemicals is one of the world’s largest producers of synthetic soda ash and Tata Tea is the largest integrated tea company in the country. Tata Power is the largest power
generating supplier in the private sector. Indian Hotels runs the largest hotel chain in the country. Titan Watches, which is a relatively new entrant, has emerged as the leader in the domestic watch market and is currently the sixth largest brand
manufactured in the world. VSNL is the leading international telecommunications service provider in India.

We have for many years been a licensed user of the “Tata” brand owned by Tata Sons Limited, and
thus have both gained from the use of the Tata brand as well as helped to sustain its brand equity. Since 1991 many multinational corporations with well-established global brands have entered the Indian market. In response, the Tata Group decided to
institute a new corporate identity program in order to re-position itself to compete in a global environment. The new corporate identity is licensed to Tata Group companies, including us, for use with their respective products and services. A
substantial ongoing investment is planned to develop and promote a strong, well-recognized and common brand equity, which is intended to represent for the consumer a level of quality, service and reliability associated with products and services
offered by Tata companies. To further protect and enhance the Tata brand equity, a code of conduct has been adopted by some of the Tata companies that have access to the larger resources and services of the Tata Group. To implement these plans, Tata
Sons Limited has undertaken a program by which consenting Tata companies are required to pay a subscription fee to participate in and gain from the new Tata Group identity. We believe that we benefit from association with the new Tata Group identity
and, accordingly, have agreed to pay an annual subscription fee to Tata Sons Limited from fiscal 1998 which is equal to 0.25% of our annual net income (defined as our net income exclusive of excise duties and other governmental taxes and
non-operating income), provided that the subscription fee does not exceed 5% of our annual profit before tax (defined as our profit after interest and depreciation but before income tax). These calculations are made with reference to our
non-consolidated Indian GAAP financial statements. See Annex A – “Reconciliation of Net Income and Shareholders’ Equity between US GAAP and Indian GAAP”. Due to our net losses in fiscal 2001 and 2002, we were not required to make
any payments in respect of this fee for those years. Pursuant to our licensing agreement with Tata Sons Limited, we have also undertaken certain obligations for the promotion and protection of the new Tata Group identity licensed to us under the
agreement. The agreement can be terminated by written agreement between the parties, by Tata Sons Limited upon our breach of the agreement and our failure to remedy the same, or by Tata Sons Limited upon providing six months notice for reasons to be
recorded in writing. The agreement can also be terminated by Tata Sons Limited upon the occurrence of certain specified events, including liquidation. Because we are the largest company in the Tata Group in terms of fiscal 2004 revenues, and because
we believe that our growing international reputation brings benefits to the Tata brand, we consider it very unlikely that we would ever be unable to use the Tata brand in relation to our products and services.    The Tata Group companies have sought to continue to follow the ideals of
ethics and integrity originally established by the founder of the Tata Group and his successors. These companies have endeavored to maintain high standards of management efficiency and to promote the commercial success of Indian enterprises. The
Tata Group has made a significant contribution toward national causes through promotion of public institutions in the field of science, such as the Indian Institute of Science and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, and in the field of
social services through the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, the Tata Memorial Hospital and the National Center of the Performing Arts. Tata trusts are among the largest charitable foundations in the country.    In addition, the Tata Group companies have sought to formulate and follow a
coherent approach to various matters of importance in Indian business life. These include a refusal to adopt any particular political alignment, and espousal of causes that benefit society generally as well as the commercial interests of Tata Group
companies.    A large number of the Tata Group companies hold
shares in one another and a number of our directors hold directorships on the boards of other Tata Group companies, including Tata Sons Limited and Tata Steel. However, there are no voting agreements, material supply or purchase agreements or any
other relationships or agreements that have the effect of tying us together with other Tata Group companies at management, financial or operational levels. Our shareholdings in other Tata Group companies are generally insignificant as a percentage
of their respective outstanding shares, and none of our shareholdings in other Tata Group companies exceeds 5% of their respective outstanding shares.

   D. Property, Plants and Equipment.
   Facilities    We currently operate four principal automotive manufacturing facilities. The
first facility was established in 1945 at Jamshedpur in the State of Jharkhand (earlier a part of the State of Bihar) in eastern India. We set up a second facility in 1966 (with production commencing in 1976) at Pune, in the State of Maharashtra in
western India, and a third in 1985 (with production commencing in 1992) at Lucknow, in the State of Uttar Pradesh in northern India. In 1998, we initiated the establishment of a fourth facility at Dharwad in the State of Karnataka in southern India.
The Jamshedpur, Pune and Lucknow manufacturing facilities have been accredited with ISO-9000 certification.    In March 2004, with the acquisition of DWCV (now renamed TDCV), we also acquired DWCV’s plant in Gunsan, South Korea.

   Substantially all of
our owned properties are subject to mortgages in favor of debenture trustees for the benefit of secured debenture holders and secured lenders. A significant portion of our property, plant and equipment is pledged as collateral securing indebtedness
incurred by us. We believe that there are no material environmental issues that may affect our utilization of these assets.    We consider all our principal manufacturing facilities and other significant properties to be in good condition and adequate to meet the needs of our
operations.    
Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.    You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with US GAAP and information included in this
registration statement. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a
result of various factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 3.D and elsewhere in this registration statement.    A. Operating Results.    Overview    Business Segments
   Our business segments are automotive operations and other
operations. Automotive operations are our most significant segment, accounting for 93.7% and 91.7%, respectively, of our total revenues and 82.0% and 82.8%, respectively, of our operating income for fiscal 2003 and 2004. India is the most
significant market for us, accounting for 96% and 93% of vehicle unit sales for fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively.

Table of Contents
Our automotive operations business segment includes all activities relating to development, design,
manufacture, assembly and sale of MHCVs, LCVs, passenger cars and UVs as well as related parts and accessories. Captive financing of our products is also included in our automotive business segment as an inherent part of our sales strategy. The
profitability of this activity is critically dependent upon interest rate movements in the economy, vehicle demand and collections. Declining interest rates and easy availability of credit in the economy have led to an increased competition in this
activity from banks (public and private) and non-banking finance companies. Our management allocates resources to, and assesses the performance of, our automotive operations as a single segment. The management of the automotive operations is aligned
on a functional basis with managers having oversight responsibility for the major operating functions within the segment. Management assesses financial and non-financial data such as units of sale, units of production, market share information,
vehicle model plans and plant location costs to allocate resources within the automotive operations business segment.    Our other operations business segment is primarily comprised of activities relating to production, designing and selling of automotive components,
construction equipment, engineering solutions and software operations. None of these other businesses meets the quantitative thresholds specified in SFAS No. 131, and accordingly, these activities have been aggregated. The automotive component
business, which is the major business component of our other operations business segment, pertains to both captive and non-captive markets. Our subsidiaries HV Axles Ltd. and HV Transmissions Ltd., which are in the truck aggregates business, derive
their revenues primarily from our vehicle business. Our subsidiary Tata AutoComp Systems Ltd. promotes joint ventures that supply auto components to our vehicle business and others in the automotive market both in India and overseas through their
joint venture partners. We do not expect the “other operations” business segment to materially affect our consolidated results of operations for the next several years.    We have experienced strong growth since fiscal 2002 with total revenues increasing by 24.8% to Rs.95,730.5 million in fiscal
2003 and further by 45.9% to Rs.139,695.7 million in fiscal 2004. As against a loss of Rs.3,413.9 million in fiscal 2002, we recorded net income in fiscal 2003 of Rs.2,769.3 million and Rs.8,899.9 million in fiscal 2004. Our revenues from automotive
operations were Rs.89,673.9 million and Rs.128,167.1 million for fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively, representing 93.7% and 91.7% of our total revenue in fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively. Our revenues from other operations were Rs.6,056.6 million
and Rs.11,528.6 million for fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively, representing 6.3% and 8.3% of our total revenue in fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively.    Our vehicle sales (including sales of TDCV subsequent to our acquisition in late March 2004) increased to a record 314,288 units in fiscal 2004 compared
to 183,224 and 219,859 units in fiscal 2002 and 2003, respectively. In fiscal 2004, our market share in India of all four-wheel vehicles sold in India increased to 25.2% from 23.4% in fiscal 2003. Our overall sales in international markets
(including sales by TDCV in India subsequent to our acquisition in late March 2004) improved to 22,075 units in fiscal 2004, an increase of 125% compared to fiscal 2003 due to expanded export sales of our passenger vehicles from India to European
and other markets during these periods. Our focus on improving our international business has resulted in a 113.0% increase in revenues from international markets for fiscal 2004 to Rs.11,054.5 million from Rs.5,190.8 million in fiscal 2003. These
revenues (primarily vehicles, but also including spare parts and other products, and excluding export incentives received from the Indian Government) accounted for approximately 5.4% and 7.9%, respectively, of our total revenue in fiscal 2003 and
2004. In addition to our automotive revenues, we also derive dividend and other income from strategic and trade investments which accounted for our residual income and from other operations.

   Significant Factors Influencing Our
Results of Operations    Our results of operations are
dependent on a number of factors, including:   


 
•
General economic conditions: We, similar to the rest of the domestic automotive industry, are substantially affected by general economic conditions in India. Economic conditions
have vastly improved since fiscal 2002 which has led to our strong growth in fiscal 2003 and 2004. See “Item 3.D — Risk Factors — Risks Associated with Our Business — General economic conditions could significantly adversely
affect our sales and results of operations”;   


 
•
Interest rates and availability of credit for vehicle purchases: Interest rates have steadily declined since the beginning of fiscal 2001 and credit finance for vehicle purchases
has since become more widely available. For further discussion of our credit support programs, see “Item 4.B —Business Overview — Sales and Distribution of Vehicles — Domestic”;   


 
•
Levels of excise duty and sales tax: For a detailed discussion regarding tax rates applicable to us, please see Item 4.B — Business Overview — Regulation — Excise
Duty and Sales Tax”; and   


 
•
Our competitive position in the market: For a detailed discussion regarding our competitive position, see “Item 4.B — Business Overview — Competition”.
   As a result of these factors, vehicle sales
(domestic and exports) by Indian automotive manufacturers increased to approximately 1,308,000 units in fiscal 2004 compared to 887,000 units and 982,000 units in fiscal 2002 and 2003, respectively.    As a result of strong demand for our products, our capacity utilization in
India rose from 50.7% in fiscal 2002 to 62.1% and 74.2% in fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively. We outperformed the unit sales growth rate of the Indian automotive industry in fiscal 2003 and 2004, which was 10.7% and 33.2%, respectively. TDCV, which
we acquired in late March, 2004, operated at around 25% capacity utilization during 2003.    We also achieved a major turnaround in our profitability over the last two fiscal years, from a net loss of Rs.3,413.9 million in fiscal 2002 to net income of Rs.2,769.3 million and Rs.8,899.9 million in fiscal 2003
and 2004, respectively. In addition to benefiting from economies of scale from increased production volumes, we also significantly improved our cost controls and productivity through value engineering and reductions in manufacturing cycle times, all
of which have contributed toward this turnaround. We also benefited from sales price increases on most of our vehicles from fiscal 2002, which helped us increase our gross margin from 18.8% in fiscal 2002 to 22.7% and 22.6% in fiscal 2003 and 2004,
respectively, and turn an operating loss of Rs.771.4 million in fiscal 2002 to an operating income of Rs.6,913.2 million and Rs.14,219.5 million in fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively. The gross margin declined in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal
2003 due to significant increase in input costs, primarily steel, partially offset by cost reductions.   
51 


Table of Contents
Notwithstanding our cost control measures, costs and expenses continued to increase in absolute terms as
a result of production volume increases and inflation as well as a significant increase in input costs in fiscal 2003 and 2004.    Though we previously had unabsorbed brought forward losses that could be set-off against future income, we are liable to pay a Minimum Alternate Tax, or
MAT, on our book profits, which cannot be carried forward. Accordingly, the total tax charge (deferred plus current) for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 on income before taxes was 40.8% and 37.5% respectively, higher than the applicable marginal tax
rate of 36.75% and 35.875% for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 respectively.    Our results of operations are also dependent on the cyclicality in demand in the automotive market, new government regulations, and, to a limited extent, to fluctuations in foreign currency rates.    The following table shows the cyclicality of demand for four-wheel automotive
vehicles in India, which is generally linked to economic growth:

   Source: SIAM.    There has been a greater emphasis by the government on the emission and
safety norms for the automobile industry. Compliance with these norms will have a significant bearing on the costs and product life cycles in the Indian automotive industry. For further details with respect to these regulations, please see
“Item 4. Information on the Company — Environmental Regulations and Initiatives.”    We are sensitive to to fluctuations in foreign currency rates with respect to our import and export activities. Our consolidated financial statements,
which are presented in Indian Rupees, are affected by foreign currency exchange fluctuations through both translation risk and transaction risk. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues, gross
margins, operating costs and expenses, operating income, net income and retained earnings.   
52 


Table of Contents
To the extent that our financial statements for a particular period will be affected by changes in the
prevailing exchange rates at the end of the period, such fluctuations may have a substantial impact on comparisons with prior periods. However, the translation effect is a reporting consideration and does not impact our underlying results of
operations. We do not hedge against our translation risk.    Transaction risk is the risk that the currency structure of our costs and liabilities will deviate from the currency structure of sales proceeds and assets. Transaction risk relates primarily to sales proceeds from our automotive business
segment exports sales produced in India. Because our exports sales are a small proportion of overall sales volumes, this risk is limited for us. However, we enter into commercial borrowings and other hedging instruments to address some of these
transaction risks. These instruments enable us to reduce, but not eliminate, the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates. Please see “Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” for further details.
   Results of Operations    The Indian automotive industry is substantially affected by general economic
conditions in India. In 1999, the automotive industry witnessed a recovery in demand after declining trends for two years. We incurred net losses in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 2001, primarily as a result of a sharp decline in demand for four-wheel
vehicles in the period from 2000 to late 2001, mainly attributable to slow economic growth in India. A revival in economic conditions in India in fiscal 2003 after nearly three years of low growth led to a sharp increase in domestic sales of
automotive vehicles to 898,000 units. Due to the continued growth of the Indian economy combined with increased credit availability at lower interest rates, sales of automotive vehicles in India reached their highest ever level of 1,161,000 units in
fiscal 2004. We benefited from these trends and enjoyed strong sales performances in both fiscal 2003 and 2004.    All of our product lines achieved growth in volumes in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Vehicle sales of 314,288 units (including 29 units sold by
TDCV subsequent to our acquisition in late March 2004) represented an increase of 42.9% during fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. Our domestic market share in India improved to 25.2% in fiscal 2004 from 23.4% in fiscal 2003 as a result of success
of our new model launches and intensive marketing efforts. We enjoyed market share gains across all of our product lines in fiscal 2004.    Our strategy of entering different markets outside India resulted in significant increase in vehicle unit sales in our international markets. As a result,
sales outside India increased to 7.0% of our total unit sales in fiscal 2004 compared to 4.5% in fiscal 2003. We expect that with availability of low-cost qualified engineering skills and presence of a large domestic market, India has the potential
to emerge as a global manufacturing base for the niche automotive products. This trend is already visible in the increasing exports of auto components out of India. With large product range, significant market position and large engineering
capabilities, we expect to benefit from this trend.    Fiscal
2004 culminated with our acquisition of TDCV on March 30, 2004 at an acquisition price of KRW 120.642 billion (approximately Rs.4,650 million or US$102 million) financed equally through our equity investment in TDCV and direct lending facilities to
TDCV, for which we provided a letter of undertaking. This acquisition will provide us with opportunity for growth in the Korean and other markets in the coming years and also provide us with synergies in marketing and product development and a

Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2004 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2003    Revenues    Our total consolidated revenues increased to Rs.139,695.7 million for fiscal
2004, an increase of Rs.43,965.2 million, or 45.9%, compared to total consolidated revenues of Rs.95,730.5 for fiscal 2003. This increase principally reflects the impact of a 42.9% increase in vehicle unit sales from 219,859 units to 314,288 units
(including 29 vehicles sold by TDCV subsequent to our acquisition in late March 2004), increased financing revenue and improved operations of our consolidated subsidiaries.    Revenues for fiscal 2004 increased by 42.1% to Rs.128,641.2 million in India and 113.0% to Rs.11,054.5 million in all other
markets, compared to fiscal 2003.    The following is a
discussion of our revenues for each of our business segments.    Automotive
Operations Segment    Automotive operations generate the
largest portion of our revenues. Revenues from this segment increased by Rs.38,493 million, or 42.9%, to Rs.128,167.1 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to the:   


 
•
39.1% increase in domestic vehicle unit sales in India   


 
•
124.8 % increase in international sales of vehicles manufactured in India   


 
•
43.6% increase in automotive financing revenues to Rs.1,402.3 million    Domestic sales were driven by road infrastructure development, a low interest rate environment and replacement demand. In addition to benefiting from
these general market conditions, we also enjoyed market share gains across our product line. International sales benefited from focused marketing efforts in our traditional international markets and entry into new markets. Increases in automotive
financing revenues resulted from our increased focus on this activity.    Other Operations Segment    Revenues from
our other operations increased by Rs.5,472.0 million, or 90.3%, to Rs.11,528.6 million in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. This increase resulted from the impact of increased revenue from all operations in this segment except that of TAL
Manufacturing Solutions Ltd., which operates in the Indian capital goods industry and which is facing increasing competitive pressure from the reduction of import duties.    Operating Costs and Expenses    Operating costs and expenses increased by Rs.36,658.9 million, or 41.3%, to Rs.125,476.2 million during fiscal 2004 compared
to fiscal 2003.    Cost of sales increased by 46.1% to
Rs.108,159.6 million in fiscal 2004, from Rs.74,038.5 million in fiscal 2003. The increase reflects primarily the combined impact of increased vehicle unit sales and an increase in input prices, partially offset by the impact of continued cost
cutting efforts. Cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues increased to 77.4% in fiscal 2004, compared to 77.3% in fiscal 2003, resulting in a gross margin decrease from 22.7% for fiscal 2003 to 22.6% in fiscal 2004.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by Rs.2,438.3 million to Rs.15,648.3 million in
fiscal 2004, compared to Rs.13,210.0 million in fiscal 2003. The largest component of the increase was outward shipping expenses, which increased by Rs.821 million to Rs.2,752.7 million in fiscal 2004 as a result of the increase in unit sales.
Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues from sales of products decreased to 11.2% during fiscal 2004 from 13.8% during fiscal 2003.    Research and development expenses decreased by 16.5% from Rs.1,536.2 million in fiscal 2003 to Rs.1,282.0 million in fiscal
2004. However this is not reflective of our research and development objectives and we continue to remain committed to a research and development program that will enable us achieve our strategy of becoming a global automotive player.    In fiscal 2004 an Employee Separation Scheme, or ESS, for the rationalization
of our workforce was reintroduced. As a result, we incurred expense for lump-sum payments and pensions paid to 542 employees who submitted to the ESS, resulting in compensation expenses of Rs.386.3 million for fiscal 2004, compared to Rs.32.6
million in respect of 87 employees who submitted to the ESS for fiscal 2003.    Operating Income    Our consolidated operating income increased by Rs.7,306.3 million to Rs.14,219.5 million in fiscal 2004 compared with operating income of Rs.6,913.2 million in fiscal 2003.    Operating income from our automotive operations increased by Rs.6,104.2 million to Rs.11,770.7 million in fiscal 2004
compared to operating income of Rs.5,666.5 million in fiscal 2003.    Operating income from our other operations increased by Rs.858.1 million to Rs.1,603.5 million in fiscal 2004 from Rs.745.4 million in fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to general profitability improvements in the operations of
our consolidated subsidiaries aided largely by the improved performance of the automotive industry in India.    Other Income and Expenses    Total net non-operating expenses decreased by 91.7% from Rs.2,286.9 million in fiscal 2003 to Rs.190.1 million in fiscal 2004, primarily due to a
significant decrease in interest expense and an increase in non-operating revenue.    Interest income declined by 15.2% to Rs.349.6 million in fiscal 2004 compared to Rs.412.4 million in fiscal 2003 due to decline in the interest rates on our term deposits in fiscal 2004 partially offset by an increase
in term deposits in fiscal 2004.    Interest expense decreased by
34.4% from Rs.4,090.4 million in fiscal 2003 to Rs.2,684.3 million in fiscal 2004, primarily due to access to low-cost international debt, repayment of higher interest-bearing long-term loans as well as a general decline in interest rates. Our
weighted average interest rate on short-term debt declined to 5.87% in fiscal 2004 from 9.76% in fiscal 2003. Similarly, our weighted average interest rate on long-term debt declined to 7.35% in fiscal 2004 from 11.16% in fiscal 2003.    Non-operating revenue increased by 54.2% from Rs.1,391.1 million in fiscal
2003 to Rs.2,144.6 million in fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher income from investments and higher exchange gains, partially offset by non-recurrence of gain on sales of assets.

Income Taxes    Income tax expense increased to Rs.5,264.0 million in fiscal 2004, compared to Rs.1,888.4 million in fiscal 2003. This
change was primarily a result of the substantial increase in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 decreased to 37.5% from 40.8% for fiscal 2003. As we were required to pay a Minimum Alternate Tax on our book profits,
which cannot be carried forward, our effective tax rate was higher than the applicable marginal tax rate of 35.875% in fiscal 2004.    Minority Interest in Consolidated Subsidiaries and Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies    Share of minority interest in profits of consolidated subsidiaries was Rs.228.9 million in fiscal 2004 compared to share in
profits of Rs.14.7 million in fiscal 2003. This change was due to the improved performance of the majority of our consolidated subsidiaries, partially offset by the losses of TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd. and Tata Precision Industries Pte. Ltd.
   Equity in earnings of affiliates amounted to Rs.363.4 million
in fiscal 2004 compared with Rs.46.1 million in fiscal 2003. This change was primarily due to the improved performance of Tata Cummins Ltd., Nita Co. Ltd. and Tata Holset Ltd., our affiliate companies.    Net Income    Our consolidated net income was Rs.8,899.9 million in fiscal 2004, compared
to a net income of Rs.2,769.3 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was the result of:   


 
•
Increased operational economies due to a 42.9% increase in vehicle unit sales.   


 
•
Continued cost reduction partially offset by an increase in input commodity prices. Due to the substantial increase in commodity prices during fiscal 2004 due to global demand
factors, our Raw Material Cost as a proportion of our Total Revenues increased to 60.1% in fiscal 2004 from 59.6% in fiscal 2003. However, we were able to bring down the other elements of cost of sales from 17.7% in fiscal 2003 to 17.3% in fiscal
2004.   


 
•
Our operating margin increasing to 10.2% in fiscal 2004 compared to 7.2% in fiscal 2003. The operating income of our automotive segment increased 107.7% to Rs.11,770.7 million while
operating income of our other operations segment increased by 115.1% to Rs.1,603.5million in fiscal 2004.   


 
•
34.4% reduction in interest cost from Rs.4,090.4 million in fiscal 2003 to Rs.2,684.3 million in fiscal 2004.   


 
•
54.2% increase in non-operating revenue to Rs.2,144.6 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to Rs.1,391.1 million in fiscal 2003.    Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2003 Compared to Fiscal year ended March
31, 2002    Revenues    Our total consolidated revenues increased to Rs.95,730.5 million for fiscal
2003, an increase of Rs.19,038.9 million, or 24.8%, compared to fiscal 2002. This increase principally reflects the impact of a 20% increase in vehicle unit sales, higher after-sales components sales, increased financing income and improved
operations of the consolidated subsidiaries.

Revenues for fiscal 2003 increased by 29.1% to Rs.90,539.7 million in India and decreased by 21.2% to
Rs.5,190.8 million in all other markets, compared to fiscal 2002.    The following is a discussion of our revenues for each of our business segments.    Automotive Operations Segment    Automotive operations constitute the largest portion of our revenues. Revenues from this segment increased by Rs.17,059.6 million, or 23.5%, to Rs.89,673.9 million in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. This increase
was primarily due to the:   


 
•
24.1% increase in domestic vehicle unit sales in India   


 
•
30.2% increase in automotive financing income to Rs.976.7 million.    These increases were partially offset by a 29.6% decline in vehicle unit sales outside India    Other Operations Segment    Revenues from our other operations increased by Rs.1,979.3 million, or 48.5%, to Rs.6,056.6 million in fiscal 2003 compared
to fiscal 2002. This increase resulted primarily from the impact of increased revenue from the automotive components and construction equipment businesses and the acquisition of Concorde Motors.    Operating Costs and Expenses    Operating costs and expenses increased by Rs.11,354.3 million, or 14.7%, to
Rs.88,817.3 million during fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002.    Cost of sales increased by 18.9% from Rs.62,243.8 million in fiscal 2002 to Rs.74,038.5 million in fiscal 2003. The increase primarily reflects the combined impact of increased automotive unit sales and an increase in input prices,
partially offset by the impact of continued cost cutting efforts as well as the non-recurrence of provisions pertaining to automotive dies carried out in fiscal 2002. Cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 77.3% during fiscal
2003 from 81.2% in fiscal 2002 resulting in gross margin increasing from 18.8% in fiscal 2002 to 22.7% in fiscal 2003.    Cost reductions in fiscal 2003 were primarily achieved through value engineering/value analysis, vendor consolidation, commonalization of components and
e-sourcing, and a reduction in conversion and fixed costs.    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.7% from Rs.13,118.1 million in fiscal 2002 to Rs.13,210.0 million in fiscal 2003. This increase is primarily due to the increased automotive unit sales and higher sales promotion
activities on account of the launch of new vehicle models, partially offset by continuing cost reduction efforts. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 13.8% during fiscal 2003 from 17.1% in
fiscal 2002.    Research and development expenses increased by
26.5% from Rs.1,214.4 million in fiscal 2002 to Rs.1,536.2 million in fiscal 2003, primarily as a result of increased activities relating to the development of new models, upgrading of existing models, and technologies to meet emission and safety
regulations in India and overseas markets.

During fiscal 2002, we had undertaken an Employee Separation Scheme, or ESS, that resulted in an expense
of Rs.886.7 million towards lump sum payments and pensions to 1,889 employees who opted for the scheme, compared to ESS-related expenses of Rs. 32.6 million in respect of 87 employees who submitted to the ESS during fiscal 2003.    Operating Income    Our consolidated operating income increased by Rs.7,684.6 million to
Rs.6,913.2 million in fiscal 2003 compared with an operating loss of Rs.771.4 million in fiscal 2002. This change was primarily driven by growing sales, continued reductions in raw material costs and fixed overhead and lower ESS expenses. The
increase was partially offset by the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses.    The following is a discussion of operating income for each of our business segments.    Automotive Operations Segment    Operating income from our automotive operations increased by Rs.6,564.2 million to Rs.5,666.5 million in fiscal 2003
compared to an operating loss of Rs.897.7 million in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to domestic vehicle unit sales growth of 24.1%, higher finance income and continued cost reduction measures. The increase was partially offset by an
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.    Other Operations Segment    Operating
income from our other operations increased by Rs.693.4 million to Rs.745.4 million in fiscal 2003 compared to Rs.52.0 million in fiscal 2002. This increase was primarily due to general profitability improvements in the operations of consolidated
subsidiaries, especially in the automotive components and construction equipment businesses.    Other Income and Expenses    Total non-operating expenses decreased by 20.8% from Rs.2,888.2 million in fiscal 2002 to Rs.2,286.9 million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to a decrease in interest expense, which was partially offset by a decrease in
non-operating revenue.    Non-operating revenue decreased by
27.8% from Rs.1,927.9 in fiscal 2002 to Rs.1,391.1 million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to non-recurring income in fiscal 2002 and a reduction in income from investments, partially offset by income from sales of property in fiscal 2003. 
  Interest income increased by 7.5% to Rs.412.4 million in fiscal 2003
compared to Rs.383.8 million in fiscal 2002, due to an increase in term deposits and interest received on certain non-recurring refunds, partially offset by declining interest rates on our deposits.    Interest expense decreased by 21.3% from Rs.5,199.9 million in fiscal 2002 to
Rs.4,090.4 million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to repayment of high cost debt and prudent working capital management leading to substantially lower borrowings as well as a general decline in interest rates. Our weighted average interest rate on
short-term debt declined from 10.6% in fiscal 2002 to 9.76% in fiscal 2003, while that on our long-term debt declined from 12.06% in fiscal 2002 to 11.16% in fiscal 2003.

Table of Contents
Income Taxes    Income tax expense increased to Rs.1,888.4 million in fiscal 2003, compared to an income tax benefit of Rs.513.0 million in
fiscal 2002. This change was primarily a result of the substantial increase in income before income taxes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 40.8%. As we are required to pay a Minimum Alternate Tax on our book profits, which cannot be
carried forward, our effective tax rate in fiscal 2003 was higher than the applicable marginal tax rate of 36.75%.    Minority Interest in Consolidated Subsidiaries and Equity in Earnings of Affiliated Companies    Share of minorities interest in consolidated subsidiaries changed from a
loss of Rs.86.4 million in fiscal 2002 to a share of profits of Rs.14.7 million in fiscal 2003. This change was primarily due to the improved performance of the majority of consolidated subsidiaries, partially offset by losses at TAL Manufacturing
Solutions Ltd. and Concorde Motors Ltd. in fiscal 2003.    Equity
in earnings of affiliates amounted to Rs.46.1 million in fiscal 2003 compared with a net loss of Rs.353.7 million in fiscal 2002. This change was primarily due to improved performances by affiliates, partially offset by a change in the status of
Concorde Motors Ltd. from affiliate to subsidiary, and the carrying value of investments in Tata Finance Ltd., an affiliate, being reduced to nil in fiscal 2002.    Net Income    We had a turnaround performance in fiscal 2003, with consolidated net income of Rs.2,769.3 compared to a net loss of Rs.3,413.9 million in fiscal 2002.
This was a result of   


 
•
The improvement in the performance of our automotive operations in fiscal 2003 primarily due to a 20% increase in total vehicle unit sales to 219,859 and significantly lower cost of
sales.   


 
•
Cost reduction efforts through value engineering/value analysis, vendor consolidation, commonizing components and e-sourcing, and a reduction in conversion and fixed costs resulting
in raw materials cost, as a ratio to total revenues, declining from 61.1% in fiscal 2002 to 59.6% in fiscal 2003.   


 
•
Reduced expenses on Employee Separation Scheme of Rs.32.6 million in fiscal 2003 compared to Rs.886.7 million in fiscal 2002   


 
•
A 21.3% reduction in interest expenses from Rs.5,199.9 million to Rs.4,090.4 million due to soft interest rates in the Indian economy and a 32.7% reduction in our overall debt in
fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002.    Critical Accounting
Policies    The preparation of our consolidated financial
statements in conformity with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and reevaluate our estimates, which are based on historical experience, industry standards, economic conditions and various other assumptions
that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information. The results of these evaluations and reevaluations form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of our
revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates, and these estimates could differ under different assumptions. We believe the following accounting policies are important to our
financial condition and results and require the most significant management judgments and estimates.   
60 


Table of Contents
Property, plant and equipment    We state property, plant and equipment at cost of acquisition or
construction less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the purchase price, taxes and duties, labor cost and direct overheads for self constructed assets, interest cost during the construction period and other direct costs incurred up to the date
the asset is available for use.    We provide depreciation at
rates prescribed by the Indian Companies Act, which approximate estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.    We review our estimated useful lives on an ongoing basis to ensure that they are appropriate. We also test our long lived assets for impairment using
undiscounted cash flows whenever events or circumstances arise that may indicate impairment. If we find that a long lived asset is impaired, we write its value down to our estimate of fair value. We also write off any plant that relates to vehicle
models that we no longer produce or that are obsolete.    Product Warranty    Vehicle warranties
are provided for a specified period of time or for a number of kilometers with respect to which the vehicle is used. Our vehicle warranty obligations vary depending upon the type of the product, geographical location of its sale and other factors.
   The estimated liability for vehicle warranties is recorded at
the time products are sold. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidence in the light of actions on product
failures.    Changes in warranty provisions as a result of
changes in estimated future warranty costs and any additional costs in excess of estimated costs relating to prior provisions can materially affect our net profit. Determining the amount of warranty cost provisions requires our management to
estimate the frequency and amount of future claims, which are inherently uncertain. Our policy is to continuously monitor warranty liabilities to determine the adequacy of warranty provisions and to maintain warranty provision at an amount our
management deems adequate to cover estimated future warranty costs. Actual claims incurred in the future may differ from our original estimates, which may result in a material change in warranty provisions.    Retirement Benefits    Pension and other post-retirement benefits costs and obligations are
dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates and other factors.    Any shortfall is treated as an expense in the year incurred.    While management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate,
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement costs and obligations and post-employment benefit costs.

Finance Receivables, deferred origination costs and allowance for credit losses 
  We finance vehicle sales with hire purchase financing provided to our
customers. Finance receivables that we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff, are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balance reduced by a valuation allowance and net of any deferred
origination costs.    Origination fees and certain direct
origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield of the related finance receivable.    We establish a specific and unallocated allowance for credit losses for finance receivables, based on management’s best estimate of losses inherent
in the finance receivable portfolio.    B. Liquidity and Capital Resources.
   We fund our capital requirements through a variety of
sources, including cash from operations, short- and long-term lines of credit, capital market borrowings and sales from time to time of our assets and investments We believe that we have sufficient resources available to us to meet our planned
capital requirements. However, our sources of funding could be adversely affected by an economic slowdown in India, which is beyond our control, and therefore a decrease in the demand for our products and services could lead to an inability to
obtain funds from external sources on acceptable terms or in a timely manner, or at all.    Cash Flow Data    The following table sets forth selected items from our consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods indicated and shows the percentage change between periods.

62 


Table of Contents
was primarily due to increases in income from our automotive operations. In addition, we have been able to generate cash
from operating activities through reductions in accounts receivable and inventory reductions. Receivable reductions have been achieved by encouraging cash sales and faster payments on credit sales. Our accounts receivable declined by Rs.1,859.1
million, Rs.1,155.1 million and Rs.2,646.0 million in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We have reduced our inventory from the equivalent of 48 days of gross sales in fiscal 2002 to 44 days in fiscal 2003 and 34 days in fiscal 2004.
   Net cash used in investing activities was Rs.1,433.1 million,
Rs.5,854.1 million and Rs.25,436.5 million in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The increase during fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to increases in our investments as we deployed excess cash in liquid investments and
property, plant and equipment and in finance receivables. The increase in net cash used in investment activities during fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 resulted primarily from investments in property, plant and equipment, purchases of
available-for-sale investments, investments in affiliates and finance receivables. These increases were partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the sale of properties.    Total capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment, excluding vehicles and equipment on operating leases, were
Rs.2,490.4 million, Rs.2,650.6 million and Rs.2,659.3 million in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The increases resulted primarily from the increase in maintenance capital expenditure.    Net cash used in financing activities was Rs.1,630.0 million and Rs.10,414.1
million in fiscal 2002 and 2003, respectively. In fiscal 2004 there was a net cash inflow of Rs.2,157.9 from financing activities. The net outflow in fiscal 2002 and 2003 related primarily to repayments of long-term debt and short-term borrowings
and, for fiscal 2003, a decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. For fiscal 2004, the net inflow from financing activities resulted primarily from equity issuance on exercise of outstanding warrants and new debt issuances, partially
offset by dividend payments to shareholders.    In view of our
profitable performance in fiscal 2003 and 2004, we paid dividends in respect of both years, after not declaring dividends in respect of either fiscal 2001 or 2002. For fiscal 2003, we declared dividends (including dividend tax thereon) totaling
Rs.1,443.0 million, which was paid on July 21, 2003. For fiscal 2004, we declared an interim dividend totaling Rs.1,578.8 million and a final dividend totaling Rs.1,615.4 million. The interim dividend was paid on February 20, 2004 and the final
dividend was paid on July 9, 2004.    Balance Sheet Data
   Our total assets were Rs.78,762.0 million and
Rs.113,875.4 million as of March 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2004 was primarily due to increases in investments, significantly cash and cash equivalents, short-term bank deposits and our acquisition of DWCV (now TDCV).
Inventory and receivables also increased in light of higher sales volumes.    Our Stockholders’ equity was Rs.20,915.6 million and Rs.37,377.6 million as of March 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The increase during fiscal 2004 was primarily due to exercise of outstanding warrants and
conversion of outstanding convertible debt securities, increase in net income and unrealized gain on available for sale securities of Rs.4,714.4 million, partially offset by dividends paid of Rs.3,021.8 million. Paid-in capital increased from
Rs.3,198.3 million to Rs.3530.0 million and additional paid-in-capital increased from Rs.21,459.4 million to Rs.26,872.3 million.    As of March 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents of Rs.6,511.1 million held primarily in Indian rupees, short-term bank deposits of Rs.2,727.7
million and investments available for sale of Rs.24,150.3 million. In comparison, as of March 31, 2003, we had cash and cash equivalents of Rs.2,758.7 million and available-for-sale investments of Rs.3,133.8 million.

Table of Contents
Gross accounts receivables increased during fiscal 2004 by Rs.2,738.4 million to Rs.9,481.3 million as of
March 31, 2004 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by quicker collections on our credit sales.    Inventories increased during fiscal 2004 by Rs.1,603.9 million to Rs.15,143.7 million as of March 31, 2004, primarily reflecting the impact of increased
unit production and sales volumes. However, as a result of stringent inventory management and controls, we reduced our inventory from the equivalent of 44 days of gross sales in fiscal 2003 to 34 days in fiscal 2004.    Gross finance receivables (excluding non-current receivables) increased
during fiscal 2004 by Rs.1,254.8 million to Rs.3,898.4 million as of March 31, 2004. This increase was primarily due to higher customer financing in light of increased unit sales.    Our investment portfolio increased by Rs.21,314.3 million during fiscal 2004 to Rs.27,052.3 million as of March 31, 2004.
The increase was primarily due to investments in mutual funds where we deployed surplus cash, and unrealized gain on our available-for-sale investments.    Capital Expenditure    We have invested approximately Rs.7,800 million over the last three fiscal years to fund our planned capital expenditure and our program for the
modernization of our production facilities. Capital expenditure totaled Rs.2,490.4 million, Rs.2,650.6 million and Rs.2,659.3 million in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Our capital expenditures during the past three years have related
mostly to the introduction of new products and quality and reliability improvements leading to operating cost reductions.    We expect to continue to make investments in our business units and research and development over the next several years, including committed capital
expenditures for our ongoing projects, product development programs and investment for mergers, acquisitions and strategic alliances, as well as new projects. In particular, we have been implementing a program to build and expand our presence in the
passenger vehicle market and to expand and enhance our pre-eminent position in the Indian commercial vehicle market, both by improving our existing product range and developing new products and platforms. As part of our future growth strategy, we
have a capital expenditure plan as of March 31, 2004 aggregating approximately Rs.51,800 million for fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007. Future capital expenditure is expected to focus on the introduction of new products, the balancing and enhancement of
plant capacity, modernization of existing plant, property and equipment, improvement of plant productivity, and the quality and reliability of our products. These expenditures are expected to be funded through a combination of internally generated
cash, existing investible surplus available in the form of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities, remaining proceeds from exercise of warrants as result of our rights issue in fiscal 2002 of Rs.9,787 million of simultaneous but unlinked
convertible and non-convertible debentures with warrants and other external financing sources. We have also agreed to purchase or arrange the purchase of preference shares issued by Tata Finance Ltd. up to a maximum amount of approximately Rs.1,500
million. We have undertaken this obligation in order to assist Tata Finance Ltd. to secure its financing on more favorable terms, and in turn to facilitate the offering of lower cost financing to our customers.    Liabilities and Sources of Financing    We fund our short-term working capital requirements with cash generated from
operations, through overdraft facilities with domestic banks, short- and medium-term borrowings from lending institutions and issuance of medium-term debentures. The maturities of these short- and medium-term borrowings and debentures are generally
matched to particular cash flow requirements. We had short-term borrowings (including the current portion of long-term debt) of Rs.5,713.8 million and Rs.7,758.9 million as of March 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We had unused short-term credit
facilities of Rs.13,748.8 million and Rs.11,486.4 million available for drawing as of March 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively.

An increasing portion of our funding requirements is being met through financings in the international
capital markets, as well as through rupee-denominated loans from banks, other financial institutions and government bodies. We expect to continue to meet a large portion of our future financing requirements in this manner.    On June 20, 2003 we entered into a loan agreement with the International
Finance Corporation, or IFC, pursuant to which we have drawn down a total of US$50 million. As a condition to any disbursement of these funds, we agreed to certain financial and other covenants. Repayment of any borrowed funds is required to be made
in installments beginning April 2008 until April 2011. In addition, on September 5, 2003 we entered into a loan agreement with the State Bank of India, pursuant to which we borrowed the equivalent of US$21 million in rupee-denominated funds.
   In July 2003, we raised US$100 million through an offering of
1% convertible notes, due in 2008. The notes are convertible into ordinary shares or GDSs at a price of Rs.250.745 (US$5.43) per ordinary share and are subject to redemption at our option any time after July 31, 2006.    On March 8, 2004, our Board of Directors approved the raising of an
additional US$500 million of funds, which was approved by a general meeting of our shareholders on April 8, 2004. On April 27, 2004, we raised US$400 million through a two-tranche offering of zero coupon and 1% convertible notes due in 2009 and
2011, respectively. The US$100 million zero coupon notes, due in 2009, are convertible into ordinary shares or global depositary shares at a price of Rs.573.106 (US$13.069) per share, subject to adjustment, from and including June 7, 2004 and are
subject to redemption at our option any time on or after April 27, 2005. The US$300 million 1% notes, due in 2011, are convertible into ordinary shares or global depositary shares at a price of Rs.780.400 (US$17.797) per share, subject to
adjustment, from and including June 7, 2004. We plan to raise the equivalent of the remaining $100 million of approved funding through rupee-denominated borrowings. We expect to use these and any other funds we may raise in the future to meet future
capital expenditure requirements for product development programs and for the purposes of funding any mergers, acquisitions or strategic alliances we enter into in either domestic or international markets, including the re-financing of our
acquisition of DWCV (now TDCV), subject to applicable Indian laws.    Our ability to incur additional debt in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties including, among other things, the amount of capital that other Indian entities may seek to raise in the domestic and foreign capital markets,
economic and other conditions in India that may affect investor demand for our securities and those of other Indian entities, the liquidity of Indian capital markets and our financial condition and results of operations.    The following table sets forth our short-term and long-term debt as of the

During fiscal 2003 and 2004 the effective weighted average interest rate on our long-term debt was 11.16%
and 7.35% per annum, respectively.    As of March 31, 2004,
approximately 36.4% of our long-term debt was denominated in rupees and the balance was denominated in dollars and other non-rupee currencies. During fiscal 2003, we were able to restructure our debt portfolio and reduce the effective cost of
borrowing. We prepaid Rs.5,250.4 million of our outstanding loans and restructured Rs.1,500.0 million of debt at a lower interest rate. We raised Rs.1,000 million by way of long-term borrowings during fiscal 2003 to effect the debt repayments.

   Some of our long-term
debt agreements contain financial covenants that require us to satisfy and/or maintain financial tests and ratios on a non-consolidated basis under Indian GAAP, including minimum tangible net worth, restrictions on the ratio of total liability to
tangible net worth and certain cash flow ratios, among others. The terms of certain of our long-term debt agreements requires us to obtain prior consent for certain specified actions including amendment of our charter documents and for creation of
any lien on our properties other than for specified purposes.    As a result of our debt reduction during fiscal 2003 and 2004, our consolidated ratio of net debt to shareholders’ equity (total debt less cash and cash equivalents and liquid marketable securities divided by total shareholders’
equity) under US GAAP declined from 0.80 to (0.16) as of March 31, 2003 and 2004, respectively. Details of the calculation of this ratio are set forth in Exhibit 7.1 to this registration statement.    The following table sets forth our contingent liabilities as of the dates

•
Rs.1,238.1 million and Rs.1,497.2 million for fiscal 2003 and 2004 respectively with respect to other guarantees, including with respect to receivables assigned by way of
securitization,   


 
•
Rs.1,500.0 million and Rs.1,500.0 million for fiscal 2003 and 2004 respectively with respect to the obligation of the Company to purchase preference shares of Tata Finance Limited
on the occurrence of certain events,   


 
•
Rs.834.9 million and Rs.2,405.0 million for fiscal 2003 and 2004 respectively with respect to executory contracts on capital accounts and not otherwise provided for and
  


 
•
Rs.2.4 million and Rs.2.4 million for fiscal 2003 and 2004 respectively with respect to arrears of cumulative preference share dividends.    On an ongoing basis, our legal department reviews pending cases, claims by
third parties against us and other contingencies. For the purposes of financial reporting, we periodically classify these matters into gain contingencies and loss contingencies. Gain contingencies are not recognized until the contingency has been
resolved and amounts are received or receivable. For loss contingencies that are considered probable, an estimated loss is recorded as an accrual in our accounts and, if the matter is material, the estimated loss is disclosed in our financial
statements. We do not consider any of these matters to be individually sufficiently material to warrant disclosure in our financial statements. Loss contingencies that are considered reasonably possible are not provided for in our accounts but, if
we consider such contingencies to be material, individually or in the aggregate, they are disclosed in our financial statements. Most loss contingencies are classified as reasonably possible unless clearly frivolous, in which case they are
classified as remote and are monitored by our legal department on an ongoing basis for possible deterioration. We do not disclose remote matters in our financial statements. See note 21 of our audited consolidated financial statements for additional
information regarding our material claims and contingencies.    Since fiscal 1997, we have benefited from participation in the Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme, or the EPCG Scheme, which permits us to import capital equipment under a special license at a substantially reduced customs duty, subject
to us fulfilling an obligation to export goods manufactured or produced by the use of capital equipment imported under the EPCG Scheme to the value of a multiple of the cost insurance freight value of these imports, over a period of 12 years from
the date of obtaining the special license. We currently hold four licenses that require us to export our products of a value of approximately US$1.96 billion between 1997 and 2014, and we carefully monitor our progress in meeting our incremental
milestones. Of this amount, we have already achieved exports of approximately US$842.4 million as of March 31, 2004, which exceeded our export milestone at that stage by approximately US$238.1 million. This leaves us with a remaining obligation to
export products of a value of approximately US$1.12 billion by September 25, 2014. In the event that the export obligation under the EPCG Scheme is not fulfilled, we would have to pay the differential between the reduced and normal duty on the goods
imported along with interest. In view of our past record of exceeding our export milestones, and our current plans with respect to our export markets, we do not currently foresee any impediments to meeting our export obligations in the required time
frame.    Finance Receivables    In fiscal 2003 and 2004, 9% and 8%, respectively, of our sales volumes were
financed under hire-purchase contracts. As of March 31, 2003 and 2004, our finance receivable portfolio was comprised of 45,134 contracts and 60,676 contracts, respectively, with gross stock-on-hire of approximately Rs.12,638 million and Rs.16,977
million, respectively. We follow stringent norms for selection of our finance customers to ensure the quality of our portfolio, including restricting maximum finance to 75% of the chassis price and 80% of the vehicle price and requiring securities
such as fixed deposits from banks or public limited companies. We originate all the contracts through our authorized dealers with whom we have long-term agreements. All our marketing and sales activity is undertaken through dealers including our
Bureau of Hire Purchase Credits and collections are carried out by our authorized dealers.

Table of Contents
We securitize or sell most of our finance receivables on a regular basis to monetize these assets. We
undertake a sale of the receivables in respect of finance agreements due from pools of purchasers. The constitution of these pools is based on criteria that are decided by credit rating agencies and/or based on the advice that we receive as to the
marketability of a pool. We undertake these securitizations of our receivables in either or both of the following forms:   


 
•
assignment of the receivables due from purchasers under hire-purchase agreements; and   


 
•
securitization of receivables due from purchasers by means of private placement.    We act as collection agent on behalf of the investors, representatives, special purpose vehicles or banks in whose favor the
receivables are to be assigned, for the purpose of collecting receivables from the purchasers on the terms and conditions contained in the applicable deeds of securitization in respect of which pass-through certificates are issued to investors. We
also secure the payments to be made by the purchasers of amounts constituting the receivables under the hire-purchase agreements to the content specified by rating agencies by any one or all of the following methods:   


 
•
by furnishing to investors a bank guarantee guaranteeing the obligations of the purchasers and the undertakings to be provided by us;   


 
•
by depositing, in favor of the investors, amounts not exceeding 5% of the gross receivables as cash collateral to secure the obligations of the purchasers and our obligations as the
collection agent; and   


 
•
by way of over-collateralization or by investing in subordinate pass-through certificates to secure the obligations of the purchasers.    The following table sets forth details of the securitization undertaken by us
as of the periods indicated:

  Interim and Final Dividend for Fiscal 2004    Our Board of Directors, at its meeting on January 22, 2004, recommended
payment of an interim dividend of Rs.4 per ordinary share on account of our profitable performance for the first three quarters of fiscal 2004. This dividend (including the dividend tax thereon), aggregating Rs.1,578.9 million, was paid on February
20, 2004. At a meeting held on July 8, 2004, our shareholders confirmed the above interim dividend and declared a further final dividend of Rs.4 per ordinary share for fiscal 2004. This final dividend (including the dividend tax thereon),
aggregating Rs.1,615.4 million, was paid to the shareholders on July 9, 2004.

Acquisition    On March 30, 2004, we acquired Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd. of South Korea, which has been renamed Tata Daewoo
Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd. See “Item 4. Information on the Company — Business Overview — Acquisition of Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Co. Ltd., Korea” for further details on this proposed acquisition.    Issuance of Convertible Notes    In April 2004, we raised US$400 million (approximately Rs.17,540 million)
through an offering of US$100 million (approximately Rs.4,385 million) of zero coupon convertible notes due in 2009 (the “2009 Notes”) and US$300 million (approximately Rs.13,155 million) of 1% convertible notes due in 2011 (the “2011
Notes”). The 2009 Notes are convertible into Shares or GDSs at a price of Rs.573.106 (US$13.070) per ordinary share, subject to adjustment, and are subject to redemption at our option at any time after April 27, 2005. The 2011 Notes are
convertible into Shares or GDSs at a price of Rs.780.400 (US$17.797) per ordinary share, subject to adjustment, and except in the event of certain changes relating to taxation in India, are not subject to redemption at our option prior to maturity.
   Unconsolidated Indian GAAP Financial Information as of
and for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2003 and 2004.    As a result of our shares being listed on the BSE, the NSE and other stock exchanges in India, we are required to file our unconsolidated financial information on a quarterly basis and consolidated financial information on an annual basis
with these stock exchanges. This information is prepared in accordance with Indian GAAP, which differs in some material respects from US GAAP. Please see Annex A to this registration statement for a description of material differences between Indian
GAAP and US GAAP as they apply to us and a reconciliation of our net income in accordance with US GAAP and net profit or loss as determined under Indian GAAP for the years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 and a reconciliation of our
shareholder’s equity in accordance with US GAAP and shareholders’ funds as determined under Indian GAAP as of March 31, 2003 and 2004. In addition, by their nature, unconsolidated financial statements may not be comparable in all respects
with our consolidated financial statements, and should not be compared to our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Because we have released financial information as of and for the three months ended June 30, 2003 and 2004 in
accordance with the rules of the Indian stock exchanges on which our shares are listed, we are required under applicable rules of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to include this unconsolidated financial information in this

unconsolidated and consolidated assets, net sales, net income or any other financial statement line item will be for the
fiscal year ending March 31, 2005. Our unconsolidated results of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2004 may not be indicative of our unconsolidated or consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2005.
   The following summary unconsolidated financial information has
been prepared in accordance with Indian GAAP. The financial information as of and for the three months ended June 30, 2003 is unaudited. The financial information as of and for the three months ended June 30, 2004 has been jointly audited by S.B.
Billimoria & Co. and A.F. Ferguson & Co.    Net
Sales    Our unconsolidated Net Sales increased 42.8%
from Rs.25,024 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 to Rs.35,741 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004, primarily as a result of a 40.6% increase in overall unit sales, including a 17.2% increase in unit exports. 
  Due to an upturn in the Indian economy, our sales increased in the
domestic market by 42.1% to 80,658 units for the three months ended June 30, 2004 from 56,761 units in the three months ended June 30, 2003. Export sales also increased, from 3,635 vehicles for the three months ended June 30, 2003 to 4,260 vehicles
for the three months ended June 30, 2004.    Consumption of
Raw Materials and Components    Our unconsolidated
consumption of raw materials and components after accounting for change in stock increased 46.1% from Rs.15,967 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 to Rs.23.328 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004. This reflected a
significant increase in overall sales and was primarily due to an increase in production to meet demand for our vehicles as well as increases in input costs.    Staff Cost    Our unconsolidated staff costs increased 27.2% from Rs.1,856 million in the three months ended June 30, 2003 to Rs.2,361 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2004. This increase was primarily due to salary increases during the period and the impact of the new wage agreements for our Pune plant, which became effective from September 1, 2003, for our Mumbai offices which became effective
from January 1, 2004 and for our Jamshedpur and Pune car plants which became effective from April 1, 2004.    Operating Profit    Our unconsolidated operating profit increased 29.5% from Rs.3,316 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 to Rs.4,294 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2004. This increase was primarily due to an increase in overall sales volumes, a more profitable product mix and our continued cost management efforts during the period.    Our unconsolidated operating margin, calculated by dividing unconsolidated
operating profit by unconsolidated net sales, for the three months ended June 30, 2004 was lower at 12.0% of unconsolidated net revenues compared to 13.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2003. This was primarily due to input cost increases which
could not be fully passed through in the form of higher vehicle sales prices.

Table of Contents
Other Income    Our unconsolidated other income increased from Rs.105 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 to Rs.412 million for
the three months ended June 30, 2004. This increase was primarily due to higher dividend income received from subsidiaries and affiliates as well as from mutual fund investments.    Interest Expense    Our unconsolidated net interest expense decreased 22.7% from Rs.538 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 to Rs.416 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2004. This decrease was primarily due to lower weighted average interest rates on our outstanding loans and higher capitalization of interest, partially offset by additional interest payment on newly issued convertible notes.
   Product Development, Depreciation and Amortization
   Our unconsolidated product development expenses
increased 132.6% from Rs.114 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 to Rs.266 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004. This reflects our continued focus on research and development in introducing product enhancement and facelifts
as well as upgrades of existing products.    Our unconsolidated
depreciation and amortization expense increased 5.7% from Rs.930 million for the three months ended June 30, 2003 to Rs.983 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004. This increase was primarily due to increases in our total assets.
   Income Tax    Our unconsolidated income tax charge increased from Rs.634 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2003 to Rs.797 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004. This was due to our higher income before tax for the three months ended June 30, 2004 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2003.    Net Profit    Our unconsolidated net profit increased 122.7% from Rs.1,003 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2003 to Rs.2,234 million for the three months ended June 30, 2004.    C.

Trend Information.    Please see Item 5.A of this registration statement for the information required by this item.    E.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements.    We use off-balance sheet arrangements where the economics and sound business
principles warrant their use. Our principal use of off-balance sheet arrangements occurs in connection with the securitization and sale of finance receivables generated in the ordinary course of our business. The receivables securitized and sold
consist primarily of retail loans secured by vehicles sold through our dealer network.    Assets in off-balance sheet entities were as follows:

We have provided bank guarantees aggregating Rs.1,192 million relating to certain securitized receivables
to certain special purpose entities (“SPEs”). Our liability would crystallize in the event customers fail to fulfill their obligations under the contract and the SPE serves a notice of shortfall in collections on us. The term of each
guarantee depends upon the weighted average term of each pool of finance receivables securitized. In the event a guarantee is called, we have the right to repossess the financed vehicle and to auction the vehicle. The maximum potential amount of
future payment would be required to make is Rs.1,192 million as at March 31, 2004. We have recognized a liability of Rs.137.5 million for these guarantees.    We also provided a letter of undertaking to a bank for extending a loan of $51.4 million (Rs.2,230.8 million) to TDCV. Under the terms of the letter of
undertaking, if TDCV is unable to repay the loan, we shall take appropriate steps to ensure immediate repayment of the outstanding debt including, without limitation, infusion of additional equity or incurrence of additional debt.    We have entered into an agreement with ICICI Bank under which we are obliged
to purchase or arrange to purchase preference shares amounting to Rs.1,500 million issued by Tata Finance Limited (“TFL”) and held by ICICI Bank if TFL fails to perform under its indenture for the preference shares. The term of this
guarantee is until February 28. 2005. The maximum potential amount that we would be required to pay is Rs.1,500 million plus interest accrued from the date of default by TFL under the date the payment is made by us. The terms of the guarantee do not
provide for any recourse provision.    F. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual

D. Employees.    We consider our human capital as a critical factor to our success. The Tata Group has drawn up a comprehensive human resource strategy that addresses key
aspects of human resource development such as:   


 
•
Code of conduct and fair business practices.   


 
•
Implementation of a performance management system to identify high performers while offering separation avenues for non-performers.   


 
•
Creation of a common pool of talented managers across the Tata Group with a view to increasing their mobility through inter-company job rotation.   


 
•
Evolution of performance based compensation packages to attract and retain talent within the Tata Group.   


 
•
Development of comprehensive training programs to impart and continuously upgrade the industry/function specific skills.    In line with the Group Human Resource strategy, we, in turn, have recently
implemented various initiatives in order to build better organizational capability that will enable us to sustain competitiveness in the global market place. Our human resources focus is to attract talent, retain the better and advance the best.
Some of the initiatives to meet this objective include:   


 
•
Delayering of the organization through work level studies.   


 
•
Succession planning through identification of second level of managers for all units, locations, functions.   


 
•
Implementation of an “Executive Selection Scheme”, which is a fast track system for identifying potential talent and offering them opportunities for growth within the
organization. Our human resources team has been invited to replicate this system in other Tata companies.   


 
•
“Talent Management Scheme” to identify high potential performers and provide them with challenging assignments for earlier development.    We employed approximately 28,800, 28,300, and 28,900 permanent employees as
of March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.    The following

   Rationalization of
Workforce: We have been attempting to rationalize our workforce through launching the Early Separation Schemes, or ESS. The ESS launched in fiscal 2002 resulted in a reduction of approximately 1,900 employees or approximately 6% of our workforce
in fiscal 2002. Similar schemes launched in fiscal 2003 and 2004 resulted in a reduction of around 90 and 540 employees respectively.

Due to these initiatives along with natural attrition, our total work force, which was at a level of
approximately 35,000 in 1997, has been reduced to approximately 28,900 at the end of fiscal 2004. This should enable us to achieve higher productivity levels in the future.    We provide training to our managers on an ongoing basis. The recent emphasis on training has been in the areas of customer
focus and total quality management. At Jamshedpur, Pune and Lucknow, we have also established training divisions that impart basic skills in various trades like milling, grinding and welding to our young apprentices, and the Management Development
Training Institutes that enhance the management skills of our executives and officers.    Employee wages are paid in accordance with wage agreements that have varying terms (typically three years) at different locations. The wage agreements for Pune (excluding the car plant), the Pune car plant,
Jamshedpur, Mumbai and Lucknow are valid until August 31, 2006, March 31, 2007, March 31, 2007, December 31, 2006 and March 31, 2005, respectively. The management of TDCV signed a new wage agreement with its union on July 16, 2004. The wage
agreement is effective from January 1, 2004 and runs through March 31, 2005.    All our regular employees in India, other than management, are members of labor unions. In March 2000, we were compelled to declare a lock-out in our Lucknow factory, which was lifted in September 2000 on the
formation of a new union. Except for this single incident, we have generally enjoyed cordial relations with our employees at our factories and offices.    During fiscal 2004, the average number of part-time employees at the end of each month was approximately 9,000.    E. Share Ownership.    The information required by this item is set forth in Item 6.A of this registration statement.    
Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions.    A.

Table of Contents
Since March 31, 2001, our largest shareholder, Tata Sons Limited (together with its subsidiaries) has
substantially increased its shareholding in us from 14.31% to 22.22%. Our second largest shareholder, The Tata Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries) has substantially increased its shareholdings but its percentage shareholding has
decreased slightly from 9.42% as of March 31, 2001 to 9.09% as of June 30, 2004, as a result of our new issuances of shares. Daimler Chrysler AG has kept its shareholdings steady but its percentage shareholding has declined from 10.0% to 7.15% as a
result of our new issuances of shares. Citibank, N.A., as Depositary for our global depositary shares, has increased its shareholding as new depositary shares have been issued, but its percentage shareholding has declined from 7.47% to 5.97% as a
result of our new issuances of shares and also the withdrawal by depositary receipt holders of shares underlying outstanding depositary shares. Life Insurance Corporation of India has decreased its shareholding and has seen its shareholding
percentage decline from 7.47% to 6.75% as a result of this decrease as well as our new issuances of shares.    According to our register of shareholders and register of beneficial shareholders, as of June 30, 2004, there were 266 record holders of our shares with
addresses in the United States, whose shareholdings represented approximately 0.06% of our outstanding ordinary shares on that date, excluding any of our shares held by United States residents in the form of depositary shares. Because some of these
shares were held by brokers or other nominees, the number of record holders with addresses in the United States may be fewer than the number of beneficial owners in the United States.    The total permitted holding of Foreign Institutional Investors, or FIIs, in the paid up share capital of the Company has
been increased to 35% by a resolution passed by the shareholders of the Company on January 22, 2004. The holding of FIIs in the Company as of June 30, 2004, was approximately 21.47%. See “Item 10. – Exchange Controls” for further
details.    None of our shares of common stock entitles the
holder to any preferential voting rights.    Under the Takeover
Regulations of India, any person who acquires more than 5%, 10% or 14% of our shares or who is entitled to exercise voting rights with respect to more than 5%, 10% or 14% of our shares must file a report concerning the shareholding or the voting
rights with us and the stock exchanges on which our ordinary shares are traded. Please see “Item 9. The Offer and Listing – Markets” for information with respect to these stock exchanges. Similar disclosures would be applicable under
the Insider Trading Regulations of India with respect to any person who acquires more than 5% of our shares or voting rights with respect to the shares. Any increases or decreases by 2% or more in the shareholding by such persons must also be
disclosed. Furthermore, under our listing agreement with the stock exchanges where our shares are listed, we are required to periodically disclose to such stock exchanges the name and percentage of shares held by persons or entities that hold more
than 1% of our ordinary shares. For the purposes of the above reporting and takeover requirements under our listing agreements, shares withdrawn from our ADS facility will be included as part of a person’s shareholding in us.    To our knowledge, we are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by
any other corporation or by any government or by any other natural or legal persons severally or jointly. We are not aware of any arrangements the operation of which may at a later time result in our change of control.    B. Related Party Transactions.    Business Relationships    We purchase materials, supplies and services from numerous suppliers throughout the world in the ordinary course of
business, including from our affiliates and firms with which certain members of our board of directors are interested. We purchased materials, supplies and services from these entities in the amount of   
80 


Table of Contents
Rs.6,524.1 million, Rs.8,477.4 million and Rs.10,599.6 million in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We also sell
our products and services to our affiliates and firms with which certain members of our board of directors are interested. We sold products and services to these entities in the amount of Rs.2,234.5 million, Rs.1,309.4 million and Rs.2,581.3 million
in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We believe all of these purchase and sale transactions were arm’s-length transactions, none of which were material to our overall operations. See note 25 of our audited consolidated financial
statements for additional information regarding our related party transactions with our associates and other related parties. The foregoing do not include transactions with and among our consolidated subsidiaries, the amounts of which are eliminated
upon consolidation when preparing our financial statements.    Loans
   We regularly have trade accounts and other receivables
payable by, and accounts payable to, our affiliates and firms with which certain members of our board of directors are interested. We had outstanding trade accounts and other receivables payable by these entities in the amount of Rs.796.5 million,
Rs.437.3 million and Rs.907.9 million as of March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. We had accounts payable to these entities in the amount of Rs.163.1 million, Rs.488.3 million and Rs.698.4 million as of March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004,
respectively.    From time to time, we provide short- to
medium-term loans to our subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as loans under a loan program established by us and our affiliates to assist executives and directors with the purchase of housing. We believe that each of these loans was entered into in
the ordinary course of business. From time to time, we also provide security deposits to the lessors of residential properties that we lease for or employees, including our Executive Directors. No extension of credit has been made, arranged or
renewed by us, directly or indirectly, in the form of a personal loan to or for any of our directors or executive officers, nor has there been any material modification to any term of any such extension of credit or any renewal of any such extension
of credit on or after July 30, 2002. As of March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, there were no outstanding loans made by us to or for the benefit of our affiliates or firms with which members of our board of directors are interested.    C. Interests of Experts and Counsel.    Not applicable.

dividend at its discretion. Since fiscal year 1956, we have had an uninterrupted dividend distribution except for the
fiscal years 2001 and 2002. We returned to dividend distribution in fiscal 2003. In view of our profitable performance in fiscal 2003, we declared dividends (net of tax) totaling Rs.1,279 million in fiscal 2003, which was paid on July 21, 2003 to
our shareholders as of June 30, 2003. We also declared an interim dividend (net of tax) on January 22, 2004 of Rs1,400 million which was paid on February 20, 2004. At a meeting held on July 8, 2004, our shareholders confirmed the payment of the

   B. Memorandum and Articles of
Association    Objects and Purposes    Our principal objects, as provided by Clause 3 of our Memorandum of
Association, include:   


 
•
manufacturing, marketing, import, export, hiring and letting on hire of commercial vehicles, automobile cars, two wheeler vehicles, heavy and construction equipment including
components, accessories and spare parts in relation thereto;   


 
•
to carry on the business as manufacturers and dealers of machinery articles and goods of all classes; and   


 
•
to carry on the business of manufacturing materials which may be usefully combined with our manufacturing and engineering business.    Directors    Under the Companies Act, as well as our Articles of Association, each of our Directors, who is in any way directly or
indirectly concerned or interested in a contract or arrangement or proposed contract or arrangement entered into or to be entered into by or on our behalf is required to disclose the nature of his interest at a meeting of the first meeting of the
Board held after the Director becomes concerned. Under the Companies Act, as well as the Articles of Association, an interested Director is not allowed to take part in the discussion of, or vote on, any contract, arrangement or proposal in which the
Director is interested.    Under the Companies Act and our
Articles of Association, we are restricted from making loans to Directors and the prior approval of the Central Government is required before we can make any loans, directly or indirectly, to any Director or provide, directly or indirectly, any
guarantees or security in connection with any loan made by a third party to a Director.    Under our Articles of Association, a director is not required to hold any qualification shares. Our Articles of Association do not prescribe an age limit for the retirement of the Directors.    Dividends    Under the Companies Act, unless the Board recommends the payment of a dividend, the shareholders at a general meeting have
no power to declare any dividend. Under our Articles of Association, the shareholders at a general meeting may declare a lower, but not higher, dividend than that recommended by the Board. Dividends are generally declared as a percentage of the par
value. The dividend recommended by the Board and approved by the shareholders at a general meeting is distributed and paid to shareholders in proportion to the paid-up value of their shares as on the record date for which such dividend is payable.
In addition, the Board may declare and pay interim dividends. The shares to be issued upon the conversion of   
87 


Table of Contents
the ADSs will be fully paid-up when delivered as provided herein. Under the Companies Act, dividends can only be paid in
cash to shareholders listed on the register of shareholders on the date which is specified as the “record date” or “book closure date”. No shareholder is entitled to a dividend while any lien in respect of unpaid calls on any of
their shares is outstanding.    Shares issued upon conversion of
ADSs will rank pari passu with our existing shares in all respects including entitlement of the dividend declared.    Dividends must be paid within 30 days from the date of the declaration and any dividend which remains unpaid or unclaimed after that period must be
transferred within seven days to a special unpaid dividend account held at a scheduled bank. Any money which remains unpaid or unclaimed for seven years from the date of such transfer must be transferred by us to the Investor Education and
Protection Fund established by the Government pursuant to which no claim shall lie against us or the said Fund.    Under the Companies Act, we may only pay a dividend in excess of 10% of paid-up capital in respect of any year out of the profits of that year after we
have transferred to our reserves a percentage of our profits for that year ranging between 2.5% to 10% depending on the rate of dividend proposed to be declared in that year. The Companies Act further provides that if the profit for a year is
insufficient, the dividend for that year may be declared out of the accumulated profits earned in previous years and transferred to reserves, subject to the following conditions: (i) the rate of dividend to be declared may not exceed the lesser of
the average of the rates at which dividends were declared in the five years immediately preceding the year, or 10% of paid-up capital; (ii) the total amount to be drawn from the accumulated profits from previous years may not exceed an amount
equivalent to 10% of paid-up capital and reserves and the amount so drawn is first to be used to set off the losses incurred in the financial year before any dividends in respect of preference or equity shares; and (iii) the balance of reserves
after withdrawals must not be below 15% of paid-up capital.    Capitalization
of Reserves and Issue of Bonus Shares    Our Articles of
Association permit us by a resolution of our shareholders in a general meeting to resolve that amounts standing to the credit of reserves or securities premium can be capitalized by the issue of fully paid bonus shares (also referred to as a stock
dividend) or by crediting shares not fully paid-up with the whole or part of any sum outstanding. Bonus shares must be issued pro rata to the amount of capital paid-up on existing shareholdings.    Any issue of bonus shares would be subject to the guidelines issued by SEBI
in this regard. The relevant SEBI guidelines prescribe that no company shall, pending conversion of convertible securities, issue any shares by way of bonus unless similar benefit is extended to the holders of those convertible securities, through
reservation of shares in proportion to the conversion. Further, for the issuance of these bonus shares a company should not have defaulted in the payment of interest or principal in respect of fixed deposits and interest on existing debentures or
principal on redemption of these debentures. The declaration of bonus shares in lieu of dividend cannot be made. Further a company should have sufficient reason to believe that it has not defaulted in respect of the payment of statutory dues of the
employee, such as a contribution to a provident fund, gratuity or bonus. The issuance of bonus shares must be implemented within six months from the date of approval by the board of directors or the shareholders, whichever is later.    Calls on Shares, Pre-Emptive Rights and Alteration of Share Capital    Under the Companies Act, as well as our Articles of Association, the Board
of Directors may from time to time make such calls as they think fit upon the members of the Company in respect of all moneys unpaid on the shares held by them respectively and each member is required to pay the amount of every call so made on him
to the Company.

Table of Contents
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, we may increase our share capital by issuing new shares
on such terms and with such rights as we, by action of shareholders in a general meeting, determine. These new shares will be offered to existing shareholders listed on the members’ register on the record date in proportion to the amount
paid-up on these shares at that date. The offer will be made by notice specifying the number of shares offered and the date (being not less than 15 days from the date of the offer) after which the offer, if not accepted, will be deemed to have been
declined. After this date the Board may dispose of the shares offered in respect of which no acceptance has been received, in such manner as the Board thinks most beneficial to us. The offer is deemed to include a right exercisable by the person
concerned to renounce the shares offered to such person in favor of any other person provided that the person in whose favor these shares have been renounced is approved by the Board in their absolute discretion. We have issued convertible and
non-convertible debentures (along with detachable warrants) on a rights basis to our shareholders. The shares to be allotted on exercise of these debentures and warrants will be allotted in accordance with the terms of these issues.    Under the Companies Act, new shares may be offered to any persons whether or
not those persons include existing shareholders, if a special resolution to that effect is passed by the shareholders of the company in a general meeting. The issuance of shares upon conversion of our outstanding Convertible Notes has been duly
approved by a special resolution of our shareholders and our shareholders have waived their pre-emptive rights with respect to these shares.    Our issued share capital may, among other things, be increased by the exercise of warrants attached to any security of us, or individually issued which
entitle the holder to subscribe for shares in us or upon the conversion of convertible debentures issued. The issue of any convertible debentures or the taking of any convertible loans, other than from the Government and financial institutions,
requires the approval by a special resolution of shareholders.    Our Articles of Association provide that, by special resolution passed at the general meeting, we may consolidate or sub-divide our share capital, convert all or any of our fully paid-up shares into stock and re-convert that stock into
fully paid-up shares or cancel shares which have not been taken up by any person.    We currently do not have any authorized preference share capital. Under the Companies Act, we may issue redeemable preference shares but (i) no such shares shall be redeemed except out of our profits which would
otherwise be available for dividends or out of the proceeds of a fresh issue of shares made for the purposes of the redemption; (ii) no such shares shall be redeemed unless they are fully paid; (iii) the premium, if any, payable on redemption shall
have been provided for out of the profits of us or out of our share premium account, before the shares are redeemed; (iv) where any such shares are redeemed otherwise than out of the proceeds of a fresh issue, there shall, out of profits which would
otherwise have been available for dividends, be transferred to a reserve fund, to be called the Capital Redemption Reserve Account, a sum equal to the nominal amount of the shares redeemed; and (v) the provisions of the Companies Act relating to the
reduction of the share capital of a company shall apply as if such reserve account were paid-up share capital of such company. Preference shares must be redeemable before the expiry of a period of twenty years from the date of their issue.
   Under the Companies Act, as well as our Articles of
Association, if our share capital is divided into different classes of shares, all or any of the rights or privileges attached to each class of shares may be varied, modified or abrogated with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than
three-fourths of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the issued shares of that class. Our Articles of Association further provide that the rights conferred upon
the holders of the shares of any class issued with preferential or other rights shall not, unless otherwise expressly prohibited by the terms of the issue of the shares of that class, be deemed to be varied by the creation or issue of further shares
ranking pari passu thereto.

General Meetings of Shareholders    We must hold our annual general meeting each year within 15 months of the previous annual general meeting and in any event
not later than six months after the end of each accounting year, unless extended by the Registrar of Companies at our request for any special reason. Our Board of Directors may convene an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders when necessary
or at the request of a shareholder or shareholders holding in the aggregate not less than 10% of our issued paid-up capital. Written notices convening a meeting setting out the date, place and agenda of the meeting must be given to members at least
21 days prior to the date of the proposed meeting. A general meeting may be called after giving shorter notice if consent is received from all shareholders in the case of an annual general meeting, and from shareholders holding not less than 95% of
our paid-up capital in the case of any other general meeting. Currently, we give written notices to all members and, in addition, give public notice of general meetings of shareholders in a daily newspaper of general circulation in Mumbai. General
meetings are generally held at some place in Mumbai.    A company
intending to pass a resolution relating to matters such as, but not limited to, amendment in the objects clause of the memorandum, buy back of shares under the Companies Act, giving loans or extending guarantee in excess of limits prescribed under
the Companies Act, and guidelines issued thereunder, is required to obtain the resolution passed by means of a postal ballot instead of transacting the business in the general meeting of the company. A notice to all the shareholders shall be sent
along with a draft resolution explaining the reasons therefor and requesting them to send their assent or dissent in writing on a postal ballot within a period of 30 days from the date of posting the letter. The quorum for a general meeting of the
company is five shareholders personally present.    Voting Rights
   At a general meeting upon a show of hands, every member
holding shares and entitled to vote and present in person has one vote. Upon a poll the voting rights of each shareholder entitled to vote and present in person or by proxy is in the same proportion as the capital paid-up on each share held by such
holder bears to our total paid-up capital. Voting is by show of hands, unless a poll is ordered by the Chairman of the meeting or demanded by shareholder or shareholders holding at least 10% of the voting rights in respect of the resolution or by
those holding paid-up capital of at least Rs.50,000 (i.e. 5,000 shares of Rs.10 each). The Chairman of the meeting has a casting vote.    Holders of ADSs may exercise voting rights with respect to the ordinary shares represented by ADSs only in accordance with the provisions of our ADS
deposit agreement and Indian law. Holders of ADSs are not entitled to attend or vote at shareholders meetings. A holder of ADSs may withdraw from the ADS facility the related underlying shares and vote as a direct shareholder, but there may not be
sufficient time to do so after the announcement of an upcoming vote. If requested by us, the depositary will notify holders of ADSs of upcoming votes and arrange to deliver our voting materials to holders of ADSs. The materials will describe the
matters to be voted on and explain how holders of ADSs on a record date specified by the depositary may instruct the depositary to vote the deposited securities underlying the ADSs as directed by the holders of ADSs. For the instructions to be
valid, the depositary must receive them in writing on or before a date specified by the depositary. The depositary will try, insofar as practicable, subject to Indian laws and the provisions of our Articles of Association, to vote or have its agents
vote the deposited securities as instructed. The depositary will only vote as instructed and is not entitled to exercise any voting discretion. If the depositary timely receives voting instructions from a holder of ADSs which fail to specify the
manner in which the depositary is to vote the shares underlying such holder’s ADSs, such holder will be deemed to have instructed the depositary to vote in favor of the items set forth in such voting instructions. If the depositary does not
receive timely instructions from a holder of ADSs, the holder shall be deemed to have instructed the depositary to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us, subject to the conditions set forth in the

Table of Contents
deposit agreement. If requested by us, the depositary is required to represent all shares underlying the outstanding
ADSs, regardless whether timely instructions have been received from the holders of such ADSs, for the sole purpose of establishing a quorum at a meeting of shareholders.    Ordinary resolutions may be passed by simple majority of those shareholders present and voting at the meeting. Special
resolutions require that the votes cast in favor of the resolution must be at least three times the votes cast against the resolution. The Companies Act provides that in order to amend the Articles of Association, a special resolution is required to
be passed in a general meeting. Dissolutions, mergers or consolidations, transfers of the whole or a significant part of our business to another company or taking over the whole of the business of any other company and, in any case where
shareholding of public financial institutions and banks exceeds 25%, appointment of statutory auditors, each require a special resolution. Our Articles of Association do not permit cumulative voting for the election of our directors.    A shareholder may exercise his voting rights by proxy to be given in the form
required by our Articles of Association. The instrument appointing a proxy is required to be lodged with the company at least 48 hours before the time of the meeting. A shareholder may, by a single power of attorney, grant a general power of
representation regarding several general meetings of shareholders. Any of our shareholders may appoint a proxy. A corporate shareholder is also entitled to nominate a representative to attend and vote on its behalf at general meetings. A proxy may
not vote except on a poll and does not have a right to speak at meetings. A shareholder which is a legal entity may appoint an authorized representative who can vote in all respects as if a shareholder both on a show of hands and a poll. 
  The Companies Act allows for a company to issue shares with differential
rights as to dividend, voting or otherwise subject to other conditions. In this regard, the laws require that for a company to issue shares with differential voting rights the company must have had distributable profits in terms of the Companies Act
for a period of three financial years, the company has not defaulted in filing annual accounts and annual returns for the immediately preceding three years, the articles of association of such company allow for the issuance of such shares with
differential voting rights and such other conditions set forth in the Companies (Issue of Share Capital with Differential Voting Rights) Rules, 2001.    Convertible Securities/Warrants    We may issue from time to time debt instruments that are partly and fully convertible into shares and/or warrants to purchase shares.    Register of Shareholders and Record Dates    We are obliged to maintain a register of shareholders at our registered
office in Mumbai or at some other place in the same city. The register and index of our beneficial owners maintained by a depository under the Depositories Act, 1996 is deemed to be a part of the index of members and register of shareholders. We
recognize as shareholders only those persons who appear on our register of shareholders and we cannot recognize any person holding any Share or part of it upon any trust, express, implied or constructive, except as permitted by law. In the case of
shares held in physical form, we register transfers of shares on the register of shareholders upon lodgment of the share transfer form duly complete in all respects accompanied by a share certificate or if there is no certificate, the letter of
allotment in respect of shares transferred together with duly stamped transfer forms. In respect of electronic transfers, the depository transfers shares by entering the name of the purchaser in its books as the beneficial owner of the shares. In
turn, we enter the name of the depository in our records as the registered owner of the shares. The beneficial owner is entitled to all the rights and benefits as well as the liabilities with respect to the shares that are held by the depository.
  
91 


Table of Contents
For the purpose of determining the shareholders, the register may be closed for periods not exceeding 45
days in any one year or 30 days at any one time. In order to determine the shareholders entitled to dividends we keep the register of shareholders closed for approximately 21 days, generally in June or July of each year. Under the listing
regulations of the stock exchanges on which our outstanding shares are listed, we may, upon at least 15 days’ advance notice to these stock exchanges, set a record date and/or close the register of shareholders in order to ascertain the
identity of shareholders. The trading of shares and the delivery of certificates in respect thereof may continue while the register of shareholders is closed.   
Annual Report and Financial Results    Our audited financial statements for the relevant fiscal year, the directors’ report and the auditors’ report, collectively the Annual Report,
must be laid before the annual general meeting. These also include other financial information, a corporate governance section and management’s discussion and analysis and are made available for inspection at our registered office during normal
working hours for 21 days prior to our annual general meeting.    Under the Companies Act, we must file the Annual Report with the Registrar of Companies within seven months from the close of the accounting year or within 30 days from the date of the annual general meeting, whichever is earlier. As
required under listing agreements with the applicable stock exchanges, copies are required to be simultaneously sent to all the stock exchanges on which our shares are listed. We must also publish our financial results in at least one English
language daily newspaper circulating in the whole or substantially the whole of India and also in a newspaper published in the language of the region where our registered office is situated.    We submit information, including our annual report, half yearly financial
statements, report on corporate governance and the shareholding pattern statement, in accordance with the requirements of the listing agreement with the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the Singapore Stock Exchange.    Transfer of Shares    Shares held through depositories are transferred in book-entry form or in electronic form in accordance with the regulations
laid down by the SEBI. These regulations provide the regime for the functioning of the depositories and the participants and set out the manner in which the records are to be kept and maintained and the safeguards to be followed in this system.
Transfers of beneficial ownership of shares held through a depository are exempt from stamp duty. We have entered into an agreement for these depository services with National Securities Depository Limited and the Central Depository Services (India)
Limited.    The SEBI requires that all investors hold our shares
in book-entry form for trading and settlement purposes, except for transactions that are not made on a stock exchange and transactions that are not required to be reported to the stock exchange.    The requirement to hold shares in book-entry form will apply to ADS holders
when the shares are withdrawn from the depositary facility upon surrender of the ADSs. In order to trade in our shares in the Indian market, the withdrawing ADS holder will be required to comply with the procedures above.    Our ordinary shares are freely transferable, subject only to the provisions
of the Companies Act under which, if a transfer of shares contravenes the SEBI provisions or the regulations issued under it or the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, or SICA, or any other similar law, the Indian Company Law
Board may, on an application made by the company, a depository incorporated in India, an investor, the SEBI or other parties, direct a rectification of the register of records. If a company without sufficient cause   
92 


Table of Contents
refuses to register a transfer of shares within two months from the date of which the instrument of transfer is delivered
to the company, the transferee may appeal to the Indian Company Law Board seeking to register the transfer of equity shares. The Indian Company Law Board may in its discretion, issue an interim order suspending the voting rights attached to the
relevant equity shares before completing its investigation of the alleged contravention. Under the Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2002, the operative provisions of which are yet to come into force, the Indian Company Law Board will be replaced
with the National Company Law Tribunal. Further, under the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003, which is expected to come into force shortly, the SICA is sought to be repealed and the Board of Industrial and Financial
Reconstruction, as constituted under the SICA, is to be replaced with the National Company Law Tribunal.    Pursuant to the Listing Agreement, in the event we have not effected the transfer of shares within one month or where the Issuer has failed to communicate
to the transferee any valid objection to the transfer within the stipulated time period of one month, the Issuer is required to compensate the aggrieved party for the opportunity loss caused during the period of the delay.    The Companies Act provides that the shares or debentures of the public listed
company (like the Issuer) shall be freely transferable. Our Articles of Association provide for restrictions on the transfer of shares, including granting power to the board of directors in certain circumstances to refuse to register or acknowledge
transfer of shares or other securities issued by us. However, under the Companies Act the enforceability of these transfer restrictions is unclear.    Acquisition of Our Own Shares    The Company is prohibited from acquiring its own shares unless the consequent reduction of capital is effected and sanctioned by a High Court of competent
jurisdiction. However, pursuant to amendments to the Companies Act, a company has been empowered to purchase its own shares or other specified securities out of its free reserves, or the securities premium account or the proceeds of any shares or
other specified securities (other than the kind of shares or other specified securities proposed to be bought back) subject to the following conditions:   


 
(i)
the buy back should be authorized by the Articles of Association of us;   


 
(ii)
a special resolution has been passed in our general meeting of us authorizing the buy back;   


 
(iii)
the buy back is limited to 25% of the total paid up capital and free reserves;   


 
(iv)
the debt owed by us is not more than twice the capital and free reserves after the buy back; and   


 
(v)
the buy-back is in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Buy-Back of Securities) Regulations, 1998.    The condition mentioned above in (ii) would not be applicable if the buy-back
is for less than 10% of the total paid-up equity capital and free reserves of the company and provided that this buy-back has been authorized by the board of directors of the company. A company buying back its securities is required to extinguish
and physically destroy the securities so bought back within seven days of the last date of completion of the buy-back. Further, a company buying back its securities is not permitted to buy-back any securities for a period of one year from the
buy-back and to issue securities for six months.    A company is
also prohibited from purchasing its own shares or specified securities through any subsidiary company including its own subsidiary companies or through any investment company (other than   
93 


Table of Contents
a purchase of shares in accordance with a scheme for the purchase of shares by trustees of or for shares to be held by or
for the benefit of employees of the company) or if the company is defaulting on the repayment of deposit or interest, redemption of debentures or preference shares or payment of dividend to a shareholder or repayment of any term loan or interest
payable thereon to any financial institution or bank, or in the event of non-compliance with other provisions of the Companies Act.    Liquidation Rights    Subject to the rights of creditors, workmen and of the holders of any other shares entitled by their terms of issue to preferential repayment over the
shares, in the event of our winding up, the holders of our shares are entitled to be repaid the amounts of capital paid-up or credited as paid-up on these shares. All surplus assets after payments due to workmen, the holders of any preference shares
and other creditors belong to the holders of the equity shares in proportion to the amount paid up or credited as paid-up on these shares respectively at the commencement of the winding-up.    C. Material Contracts.    Neither Tata Motors Ltd. nor any of its consolidated subsidiaries or associated companies is a party to any material
contract other than contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business.    D. Exchange Controls.    General    Prior to June 1, 2000, foreign investment in Indian securities, including
the acquisition, sale and transfer of securities of Indian companies, was regulated by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, or FERA, and the notifications issued by the Reserve Bank of India or RBI thereunder.    With effect from June 1, 2000, foreign investment in Indian securities is
regulated by the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999, or FEMA, and the rules, regulations and notifications made under FEMA. A person resident outside India can transfer any security of an Indian company or any other security to an Indian resident
only under the terms and conditions specified in FEMA and the rules and regulations made thereunder or as permitted by the RBI.    The RBI issued the Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or issue of Security by a Person Resident Outside India) Regulations 2000, or the Regulations, to
regulate the issue of Indian securities including American depository receipts to persons resident outside India and the transfer of Indian securities by or to persons resident outside India.    The Regulations provide that an Indian entity may issue securities to a
person resident outside India or record in its books any transfer of security from or to such person only in the manner set forth in FEMA and the rules and regulations made thereunder or as permitted by the RBI.    Foreign Direct Investment    The Government of India, pursuant to its liberalization policy, set up the
Foreign Investment Promotion Board, or the FIPB, to regulate all foreign direct investment into India. Foreign Direct Investment, or FDI, means investment by way of subscription and/or purchase of securities of an Indian company by a non resident
investor. FIPB approval is required for investment in some sectors, including housing, petroleum (other than refining), defense and strategic industries. Also, the following investments would require the prior permission of the FIPB:   


 
•
investments in excess of specified sectoral caps;   
94 


Table of Contents


 
•
investments by any person who has or had an existing or previous venture or tie up in India through investment in shares or debentures or a technical collaboration or a trade mark
agreement or investment by whatever name called in the same field or allied field to that in which the Indian company whose shares are being acquired is engaged;   


 
•
investment being more than 24% in the equity capital of units manufacturing items reserved for small scale industries;   


 
•
investments by an unincorporated entity;   


 
•
investment in industries for which industrial licensing is compulsory; and   


 
•
all proposals relating to the acquisition of shares of an Indian company by a foreign investor (including a non resident Indian).    Currently, subject to certain exceptions, Foreign Direct Investment and
investment by individuals of Indian nationality or origin residing outside India, or Non-Resident Indians, in Indian companies does not require the prior approval of the FIPB or the RBI. The Government has indicated that in all cases where Foreign
Direct Investment is allowed on an automatic basis without FIPB approval the RBI would continue to be the primary agency for the purposes of monitoring and regulating foreign investment. In cases where FIPB approval is obtained, no approval of the
RBI is required, although a declaration in the prescribed form, detailing the foreign investment, must be filed with the RBI once the foreign investment is made in the Indian company. The foregoing description applies only to an issuance of shares
by, and not to a transfer of shares of, Indian companies.    The
Government has set up the Foreign Investment Implementation Authority, or the FIIA in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The FIIA has been mandated to (i) translate foreign direct investment approvals into implementation, (ii) provide a
pro-active one stop after care service to foreign investors by helping them obtain necessary approvals, (iii) sort out operational problems and (iv) meet with various Government agencies to find solutions to foreign investment problems and
maximizing opportunities through a partnership approach.    Pricing
   The price of shares of a listed Indian company issued to
non-residents under the foreign direct investment scheme on an automatic basis cannot be less than the price worked out in accordance with the guidelines issued by the SEBI for the preferential allotment of shares. Where an Indian company is not
listed on any recognized stock exchange in India the minimum issue price of the shares would be based on a fair valuation of shares done by a chartered accountant as per the guidelines issued by the erstwhile Controller of Capital Issues.
   Every Indian company issuing shares or convertible debentures
in accordance with the Regulations is required to submit a report to the RBI within 30 days of receipt of the consideration and another report within 30 days from the date of issue of the shares to the non-resident purchaser.    The above description applies only to a fresh issue of shares or convertible
debentures by an Indian company.

Investment by Foreign Institutional Investors    In September 1992, the Government issued guidelines that enable foreign institutional investors, including institutions such
as pension funds, investment trusts, asset management companies, nominee companies and incorporated/institutional portfolio managers referred to as Foreign Institutional Investors, or FIIs, to make portfolio investments in all securities of listed
and unlisted companies in India. Investments by registered Foreign Institutional Investors or Non-Resident Indians made through a stock exchange are known as Portfolio Investments. Foreign investors wishing to invest and trade in Indian securities
in India under these guidelines are required to register with the SEBI and obtain a general permission from the RBI under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. However, since the SEBI provides a single window clearance, a single application
must be made to the SEBI. Foreign investors are not necessarily required to register with the SEBI as Foreign Institutional Investors and may invest in securities of Indian companies pursuant to the Foreign Direct Investment route discussed above.
   Foreign Institutional Investors who are registered with the
SEBI are required to comply with the provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Foreign Institutional Investors) Regulations, 1995, or Foreign Institutional Investor Regulations. A registered foreign institutional investor may buy,
subject to the ownership restrictions discussed below, and sell freely securities issued by any Indian company, realize capital gains on investments made through the initial amount invested in India, subscribe to or renounce rights offerings for
shares, appoint a domestic custodian for custody of investments made and repatriate the capital, capital gains, dividends, income received by way of interest and any compensation received towards sale or renunciation of rights offerings of shares. A
Foreign Institutional Investor may not hold more than 10% of the total issued capital of a company in its own name; a corporate/individual sub-account of the Foreign Institutional Investor may not hold more than 5% of the total issued capital of a
company, and a broad based sub-account may not hold more than 10% of the total issued capital of a company. The total holding of all Foreign Institutional Investors in a company is subject to a cap of 24% of the total paid up capital of a company,
which can be increased to the relevant sectoral cap/ceiling applicable to the said company under the Foreign Direct Investment Regime with the passing of a special resolution by the shareholders of the company in a general meeting.    Registered FIIs are generally subject to tax under Section 115AD of the
Income Tax Act of 1961. There is uncertainty under Indian law as to the tax regime applicable to FIIs that hold and trade in ADSs and Shares. See “Item 10.E — Taxation — Indian Taxation”.    Portfolio Investment by Non-Resident Indians    A variety of methods for investing in shares of Indian companies are
available to Non-Resident Indians. These methods allow Non-Resident Indians to make Portfolio Investments in shares and other securities of Indian companies on a basis not generally available to other foreign investors. In addition to Portfolio
Investments in Indian companies, non-resident Indians may also make foreign direct investments in Indian companies pursuant to the Foreign Direct Investment route discussed above.    Transfer of shares and convertible debentures of an Indian company by a person resident outside India    Subject to what is stated below, a person resident outside India may
transfer the shares or debentures held by him in Indian companies in accordance with the Regulations. A non-resident, not being a Non-Resident Indian, may transfer by way of sale the shares or convertible debentures held by him to any other
non-resident without the prior approval of the RBI or the FIPB. A Non-Resident Indian may transfer by way of sale the shares or convertible debentures held by him or it to another Non-Resident Indian, as the case may be, without the prior approval
of the RBI or the FIPB. In both cases above, the person to whom the shares are being transferred is required to obtain the prior permission of the Central Government to acquire the shares if

he has an existing or previous venture or tie up in India through investment in shares or debentures or a technical
collaboration or a trade mark agreement or investment by whatever name called in the same field or allied field, other than the information technology field, to that in which the Indian company whose shares are being transferred is engaged. Further,
a non-resident may transfer any security held by him to a person resident in India by way of gift.    Under the FEMA, approval of the RBI is required for the sale by a Non-Resident of India to a resident of India of underlying shares withdrawn from an ADR
program, unless the sale is made on a stock exchange at the market price. However, if the sale exceeds the limits prescribed, the Takeover Code may apply. Applications for approval should be submitted to the RBI on Form TS 1 which requires
information as to the transferor, the transferee, the shareholding structure of the Indian company whose shares are to be sold, the proposed sale price per share and other information. In considering an application for approval, the RBI seeks to
satisfy itself that the shares are being sold at or close to market price. The RBI is not required to respond to a Form TS 1 application within any specific time period, and may grant or deny the application at its discretion.    In the event of a sale of the underlying shares withdrawn from an ADR
program, the sale made in compliance with the above-mentioned procedures, remittance overseas of the proceeds from the sale of the underlying shares is permitted.    Any Non-Resident of India seeking to sell shares received upon surrender an ADR or otherwise transfer these shares within
India, whether or not through the BSE, NSE or any other stock exchange, should seek advice from their Indian legal advisers as to the applicable requirements.   
Sponsored ADR Schemes    From November 2002, the RBI has permitted existing shareholders of Indian companies to sell their shares through the issuance of ADRs against the block of
existing shares of the Indian company, subject to the following conditions:   


 
•
The facility to sell the shares would be available pari passu to all categories of shareholders.   


 
•
The sponsoring company whose shareholders propose to divest existing shares in the overseas market through issue of ADRs will give an option to all its shareholders indicating the
number of shares to be divested and the mechanism how the price will be determined under the ADR norms. If the shares offered for divestment are more than the pre-specified number to be divested, shares would be accepted from the existing
shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.   


 
•
The proposal for divestment of the shares would have to be approved by a special resolution of the Indian company.   


 
•
The proceeds of the ADR issue raised abroad shall be repatriated into India within a period of one month from the closure of the issue. However, the proceeds of the ADR issue can
also be retained abroad to meet the future foreign exchange requirements of the company and by a recent notification this facility has been extended indefinitely till further notice.   


 
•
The issue related expenses in relation to public issue of ADRs under this scheme would be subject to a ceiling of 4% of the issue size in the case of public issues and 2% of the
issue size in the case of private placements. The issue related expenses would include underwriting commissions, lead managers’ charges, legal expenses and reimbursable expenses. The issue expenses shall be passed on to the shareholders
participating in the sponsored issue on a pro rata basis.

Transfer of ADRs by Non-residents    The Ministry of Finance, Government of India, has granted general permission for the transfer of ADRs outside India. The
Ministry of Finance, Government of India, has also permitted non-resident holders of ADRs to surrender ADRs in exchange for the underlying shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Deposit Agreement an investor who surrenders ADRs and withdraws shares is
permitted to re-deposit such shares subject to the total issued ADRs and obtain ADRs at a later time.    The RBI has permitted the re-conversion of shares of Indian Companies into ADRs, subject to the following conditions:   


 
•
the Indian company has issued ADRs;   


 
•
the shares of the Indian company are purchased by a registered stock broker in India in the name of the Depository, on behalf of the non-resident investor who wishes to convert such
shares into ADRs;   


 
•
shares are purchased on a recognized stock exchange;   


 
•
the shares are purchased with the permission of the custodian of the ADRs of the Indian company and are deposited with the custodian;   


 
•
the issuer company has authorized the custodian to accept shares from non-resident investors for re-issuance of ADRs;   


 
•
the number of shares so purchased do not exceed the ADRs converted into underlying shares, and are in compliance with the sectoral caps applicable under the Foreign Direct
Investment regime; and   


 
•
the non-resident investor, broker, custodian and the overseas depository comply with the provisions of the Depository Receipt Mechanism and the guidelines issued thereunder from
time to time.    Also the RBI has prescribed that
the domestic custodians are the entity required to ensure compliance with the RBI guidelines and to file reports with the RBI from time to time, the domestic custodian is also required to perform the following functions:   


 
•
provide a certificate to the RBI and the SEBI stating that the sectoral caps for foreign investment in the relevant company have not been breached;   


 
•
monitor the total number of ADRs that have been converted into underlying shares by non-resident investors;   


 
•
liaise with the issuer company to ensure that the foreign investment restrictions, if any, are not being breached; and   


 
•
file a monthly report about the ADR transactions under the two-way fungibility arrangement with the RBI and the SEBI.    E. Taxation.    This section describes the material United States federal and Indian stamp duty and income and service tax consequences of
acquiring, owning and disposing of shares or ADSs. It applies to you only if you hold your shares or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes. This section does not apply to you if you are a member of a special class of holders subject to special
rules, including:   


 
•
a dealer in securities,   
98 


Table of Contents


 
•
a trader in securities that elects to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for securities holdings,   


 
•
a tax-exempt organization,   


 
•
a life insurance company,   


 
•
a person liable for alternative minimum tax,   


 
•
a person that actually or constructively owns 10% or more of our voting stock,   


 
•
a person that holds shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, or   


 
•
a U.S. holder (as defined below) whose functional currency is not the dollar.   
This section is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed regulations, published rulings
and court decisions, and the laws of India all as currently in effect, as well as on the Convention Between the United States of America and India for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on
Income (the “Treaty”). These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. In addition, this section is based in part upon the representations of the Depositary and the assumption that each obligation in the Deposit
Agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.    You are a U.S. holder if you are a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs and you are, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:   


 
•
a citizen or resident of the United States,   


 
•
a domestic corporation,   


 
•
an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source, or   


 
•
a trust if a United States court can exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more United States persons are authorized to control all
substantial decisions of the trust.    A
“non-U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of shares or ADSs that is not a United States person for United States federal income tax purposes.    With regard to Indian tax, the following discussion addresses only the tax consequences for persons that are “non-residents” of India, as
defined in the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961, or the Income Tax Act and is based on the provisions of Section 115AC and other applicable provisions of the Income Tax Act and the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares
(through Depository Receipt Mechanism) Scheme 1993 promulgated by the Government of India, or together the Section 115AC Regime.

Table of Contents
You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state and local and the Indian and other tax
consequences of owning and disposing of shares and ADSs in your particular circumstances.    This discussion addresses only United States federal income taxation and Indian stamp duty and income and service taxation.    In general, and taking into account the earlier assumptions, for United States federal income and Indian tax purposes, if you hold ADRs evidencing ADSs,
you will be treated as the owner of the shares represented by those ADRs. Exchanges of shares for ADRs, and ADRs for shares, generally will not be subject to United States federal income or to Indian tax, but such exchange may give rise to Indian
stamp duty as described below under “— Stamp Duty”.    Taxation
of Dividends    Indian Taxation. Dividends paid to non-residents of
India will not be liable to tax. However, the Company will be liable to pay a “dividend distribution tax” currently at the rate of approximately 12.8% (inclusive of a surcharge) on the total amount distributed as a dividend. Further, under
the Union Budget 2004-2005, an additional education cess of 2% is proposed to be levied on all direct and indirect taxes, including dividend distribution tax. Distributions to non-residents of India of additional ADSs or shares or rights to
subscribe for such shares made with respect to ADSs or shares are not subject to Indian tax.    United States Federal Income Taxation.    U.S. Holders. Under the United States federal income tax laws, if you are a U.S. holder, the gross amount of any dividend we pay out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for United
States federal income tax purposes) is subject to United States federal income taxation. If you are a noncorporate U.S. holder, dividends paid to you in taxable years before January 1, 2009 that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable
to you at a maximum tax rate of 15% provided that you hold the shares or ADSs for more than 60 days during the 120-day period beginning 60 days before the ex-dividend date and meet other holding period requirements. On February 19, 2004 the IRS
announced that it will permit taxpayers to apply a proposed legislative change to the holding period requirement described in the preceding sentence as if such change were already effective. This legislative “technical correction” would
change the minimum required holding period, retroactive to January 1, 2003, to more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days after the ex-dividend date. Dividends we pay with respect to the shares or ADSs generally will be qualified
dividend income.    The dividend is taxable to you when you, in
the case of shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, receive the dividend, actually or constructively. The dividend will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to United States corporations in respect of
dividends received from other United States corporations. Dividends will be income from sources outside the United States, and generally will be “passive income” or “financial services income,” which is treated separately from
other types of income for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit allowable to you.    In the case of shares, the amount of the dividend distribution that you must include in your income as a U.S. holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the rupee payments made, determined at the spot rupee/U.S. dollar
rate on the date the dividend distribution is includible in your income, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the
date you include the dividend payment in income to the date you convert the payment into U.S. dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the special tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income. The gain or
loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the Untied States for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.   
100 


Table of Contents
Distribution in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for United States
federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of your basis in the shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain.    Distributions of additional shares to you with respect to shares or ADSs that are made as part of a pro rata distribution to
all of our shareholders generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax.    Non-U.S. Holders. If you are a non-U.S. holder, dividends paid to you in respect of shares or ADSs will not be subject to United States federal income tax unless the dividends are “effectively
connected” with your conduct of a trade or business within the United States, and the dividends are attributable to a permanent establishment that you maintain in the United States if that is required by an applicable income tax treaty as a
condition for subjecting you to United States taxation on a net income basis. In such cases you generally will be taxed in the same manner as a U.S. holder. If you are a corporate non-U.S. holder, “effectively connected” dividends may,
under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate or at a lower rate if you are eligible for the benefits of an income tax treaty that provides for a lower rate.    Taxation of Capital Gains    Indian Taxation    Capital Gains Generally. Under the Section 115AC Regime, any gain realized on the sale of the ADSs representing
shares from one non-resident of India to another non-resident holder outside India is not subject to Indian capital gains tax. However, it is unclear whether a capital gain derived from the sale of rights by a non-resident of India to another
non-resident holder outside India may attract to Indian capital gains tax.    Any gain realized on the sale of the shares by a non-resident of India to an Indian resident, whether in India or outside India, or to a non-resident investor in India will be subject to Indian capital gains tax. For
the purpose of computing capital gains tax on the sale of the shares under the Section 115AC Regime, the cost of acquisition of shares received in exchange for ADSs will be determined on the basis of the prevailing price of the Shares on the BSE or
NSE as on the date on which the relevant Depository gives notice to its Custodian for the delivery of such shares upon redemption of the ADSs. A non-resident holder’s holding period (for purposes of determining the applicable Indian capital
gains tax rate) in respect of Shares received in exchange for ADSs commences on the date of the advice of withdrawal of such Shares by the relevant Depository to its custodian.    Capital gains realized in respect of shares held (calculated in the manner set forth in the prior paragraph) for more than
12 months (long term gain — “long term” is defined differently under the Income Tax Act for the purposes of listed securities in contrast with the ADSs) is subject to tax at the rate of 10% plus applicable surcharge on income tax.
Capital gain realized in respect of shares held (calculated in the manner set forth in the prior paragraph) for 12 months or less (short term gain) is subject to tax at variable rates with a maximum rate of 40% plus applicable rate of surcharge on
income tax. The actual rate of tax on short term gains depends on a number of factors, including the legal status of the non-resident holder and the type of income chargeable in India.    Under the Union Budget 2004-2005 the following measures, which are also applicable to Registered FIIs, have been proposed:
   a) Long term capital gains arising on sale of shares effected
on a recognized stock exchange in India would be exempt form tax. This exemption is proposed to be effective after the introduction of the security transaction tax described below.   
101 


Table of Contents
b) The tax on short term capital gains arising on sale of shares, effected on a recognized stock exchange
in India is proposed to be reduced from 30% to 10% (plus applicable surcharge and an education cess of 2% which is proposed to be levied on all direct and indirect taxes).    c) A securities transaction tax of 0.15% (plus an education cess of 2% which is proposed to be levied on all direct and
indirect taxes) which is proposed to be levied on all transactions on a recognized stock exchange in India. The Finance Minister of India has proposed that this tax is to be borne equally between the buyer and the seller.    Tax on capital gains is to be deducted at source by the person paying for the
shares in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act.    Capital Losses. The Section 115AC Regime does not deal with capital losses arising on a transfer of shares in India. In general terms, losses arising from a transfer of a capital asset in India can only be set
off against capital gains and not against any other income. To the extent that the losses are not absorbed in the year of transfer, they may be carried forward for a period of eight assessment years immediately succeeding the assessment year for
which the loss was first computed and may be set off against the capital gains assessable for such subsequent assessment years. In order to make use of capital losses in this manner, the non-resident investor would be required to file appropriate
and timely tax returns in India and undergo the usual assessment procedures.    Tax Treaties. Dividend income is not subject to tax in India in the hands of the holder of the shares. If any Shares are held by a U.S. holder following withdrawal thereof from the depository facility under the
Deposit Agreement, provisions of any double taxation treaty, if any, entered into by India with the country of residence of such U.S. holder will be applicable to taxation of any capital gain arising from transfer of such shares.    However, during the period of fiduciary ownership of Shares in the hands of
the Overseas Depository Bank, the provisions of Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement entered into by the Government of India with the country of residence of the Overseas Depository Bank will be applicable in the matter of taxation of capital gains
in respect of ADSs.    Stamp Duty. Under Indian law, any
transfer of ADSs will be exempt from liability to Indian stamp duty. Purchasers of shares who seek to register such shares on the share register of the company are required to pay Indian stamp duty at the rate of Rs.0.25 for every Rs.100 or part
thereof of the market value of such shares. In order to register a transfer of shares in the physical form with the company, it is necessary to present a stamped deed of transfer. An acquisition of shares in physical form from the Depository in
exchange for ADSs representing such shares will not render an investor liable to Indian stamp duty but the company will be required to pay stamp duty at the applicable rate on the Share Certificate. However, since our shares are compulsorily
deliverable in dematerialized form (except for trades of up to 500 shares which may be delivered in physical form), no stamp duty is payable on the acquisition or transfer of shares in dematerialized form.    Service Tax. Brokerage or commission fees paid to stockbrokers in
India in connection with the sale or purchase of shares are now subject to an Indian service tax of 8%. Further, under the Union Budget 2004-2005, it is proposed to increase the rate of service tax from 8% to 10% and to levy a 2% education cess on
all direct and indirect taxes, including service tax. A stockbroker is responsible for collecting such service tax at such rate and for paying the same to the relevant authority.

United States Federal Income Taxation.    U.S. Holders. If you are a U.S. holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of your shares or ADSs, you will recognize
capital gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the dollar value of the amount that you realize and your tax basis, determined in dollars, in your shares or ADSs. Capital gain of a noncorporate U.S.
holder that is recognized before January 1, 2009 is generally taxed at a maximum rate of 15% where the holder has a holding period greater than one year. The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the United States for
foreign tax credit limitation purposes.    Subject to certain
limitations, Indian withholding tax will be creditable against your United States federal income tax liability. In the case of income to which Indian withholding for short-term capital gains applies, the income may be general limitation income
rather than passive income.    Non-U.S. Holders. If you
are a non-U.S. holder, you will not be subject to United States federal income tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of your shares or ADSs unless:   


 
•
the gain is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment that you
maintain in the United States if that is required by an applicable income tax treaty as a condition for subjecting you to United States taxation on a net income basis, or   


 
•
you are an individual, you are present in the United States for 183 or more days in the taxable year of the sale and certain other conditions exist.    If you are a corporate non-U.S. holder, “effectively connected”
gains that you recognize may also, under certain circumstances, be subject to an additional “branch profits tax” at a 30% rate or at a lower rate if you are eligible for the benefits of an income tax treaty that provides for a lower rate.
   PFIC Rules. We believe that shares and ADSs should not
be treated as stock of a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes, but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change.    Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.    If you are a noncorporate U.S. holder, information reporting requirements, on Internal Revenue Service Form 1099, generally
will apply to:   


 
•
dividend payments or other taxable distributions made to you within the United States, and   


 
•
the payment of proceeds to you from the sale of shares or ADSs effected at a United States office of a broker.    Additionally, backup withholding may apply to such payments if you are a
noncorporate U.S. holder that:   


 
•
fails to provide an accurate taxpayer identification number,   


 
•
is notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to report all interest and dividends required to be shown on your federal income tax returns, or
  
103 


Table of Contents


 
•
in certain circumstances, fails to comply with applicable certification requirements.    Payment of the proceeds from the sale of shares or ADSs effected at a foreign office of a broker generally will not be
subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However, a sale of shares or ADSs that is effected at a foreign office of a broker will be subject to information reporting and backup withholding if:   


 
•
the proceeds are transferred to an account maintained by you in the United States,   


 
•
the payment of proceeds or the confirmation of the sale is mailed to you at a United States address, or   


 
•
the sale has some other specified connection with the United States as provided in U.S. Treasury regulations,    unless the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United
States person and the documentation requirements described above are met or you otherwise establish an exemption.    In addition, a sale of shares or ADSs effected at a foreign office of a broker will be subject to information reporting if the broker is:   


 
•
a United States person,   


 
•
a controlled foreign corporation for United States tax purposes,   


 
•
a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income is effectively connected with the conduct of a United States trade or business for a specified three-year period, or
  


 
•
a foreign partnership, if at any time during its tax year:   


 
•
one or more of its partners are “U.S. persons”, as defined in U.S. Treasury regulations, who in the aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interest in the
partnership, or   


 
•
such foreign partnership is engaged in the conduct of a United States trade or business,    unless the broker does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a United States person and the documentation requirements
described above are met or you otherwise establish an exemption. Backup withholding will apply if the sale is subject to information reporting and the broker has actual knowledge that you are a United States person.    You generally may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules that exceed your income tax liability by filing a refund claim with the United States Internal Revenue Service.    F. Dividends and Paying Agents.    The information required by this item is set forth in Item 8.A of this registration statement.    G.

Item 11. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.    Our exposure to financial market risks derives primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To mitigate these risks, we utilize
derivative financial instruments, including interest rate option contracts and currency swap agreements, the application of which is primarily for hedging purposes and not for speculative purposes.    Interest Rate and Swap Agreements    Our exposure to interest rate risks relates primarily to:   


 
•
our long term debt, which is normally utilized to finance capital expenditure;   


 
•
our investment in marketable securities; and   


 
•
finance receivables.   
105 


Table of Contents
We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing,
investing and cash management activities. We enter into various financial instrument transactions to maintain the desired level of exposure to the risk of interest rate fluctuations and to minimize interest expense. We have entered into exchange
traded future and option contracts, interest rate caps and floors, along with various investments, to reduce the interest rate risk related to these activities.   
There are particular shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented below. The model assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous
parallel shifts in the yield curve; however, in reality, changes are rarely instantaneous. Although some assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may not react correspondingly to changes in market interest
rates. Also, the interest rates on some types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates.    The sensitivity to a change in interest rates of 1% on our unhedged floating
rate loans as at March 31, 2003 and March 31, 2004 is Rs.64.3 million and Rs.44.4 million, respectively. The sensitivity to a change in interest rates of 1% on the value of our portfolio of marketable securities as at March 31, 2004 is Rs.124.4
million. We did not have any marketable securities as of March 31, 2003.    We may have a prepayment and default risk with respect to our finance receivables due to any change in interest rates. Based on our model, with certain assumptions, the sensitivity to a 1% change in interest rates on
the prepayment risk that is perceived by us on unearned finance charges as at March 31, 2003 and 2004 is Rs.12.4 million and Rs.10.9 million, respectively. The sensitivity to a change in interest rates of 1% on the default (written offs) amounts as
at March 31, 2003 and 2004 is Rs.19.2 million and Rs.21.3 million, respectively, on the unsecuritized portion of our finance receivables.    Foreign exchange risk    The following table sets forth information relating to our foreign currency debt exposure for the periods indicated.

   We have foreign
currency exposure related to buying, selling and financing in currencies, primarily in the dollar, other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to future earnings or assets and liabilities
that are exposed due to operating cash flows and various financial instruments that are denominated in foreign currencies.    We use derivative instruments primarily to hedge our foreign exchange exposure, and also to hedge our interest rate exposure. Nevertheless, a weakening of
the rupee against the dollar and other major foreign currencies may have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing and consequently may increase the cost of financing our capital expenditures. In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue
to experience foreign exchange losses and gains on obligations denominated in foreign currencies in respect of our borrowings.    The sensitivity to a change in currency prices of 1% per US$ on our unhedged foreign currency loans as at March 31, 2003 and 2004 is Rs.1.0 million and
Rs.76.2 million, respectively.

We completely hedge our exports. However, some of our imports remain unhedged. The sensitivity to a 1%
change in exchange rates of individual currencies against the rupee for the unhedged portion of our imports as at March 31, 2003 and 2004 is Rs.185.6 million and Rs.26.3 million, respectively.    Investment price risk    The fair value of some of our investments in available-for-sale securities exposes us to equity price risks. In general,
these securities are not held for trading purposes. These investments are subject to changes in the market prices of the securities. The fair value of our available-for-sale securities as of March 31, 2003 and 2004 was Rs.2,375.6 million and
Rs.7,591.3 million, respectively. A 1% change in equity prices of available-for-sale securities held as at March 31, 2003 and 2004 would result in an impact of Rs.23.8 million and Rs.75.9 million, respectively.    Commodity price risk    Commodity price risk is the possibility of impact from changes in the prices of commodities, such as non-ferrous metals
(like aluminum), ferrous alloys (like steel) and others (like rubber), which we use in the production of automotive vehicles and their components. We do not use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of these
commodities. However, we cover some of these risks through long-term purchase contracts.    
Item 12. Description of Securities other than Equity Securities.    A. Debt Securities.    Not applicable.    B. Warrants and Rights.    Not applicable.    C. Other Securities.    Not applicable.    D. Description of American Depositary
Shares.    Citibank, N.A. has agreed to act as the depositary bank for the American Depositary Shares. Citibank’s depositary offices are located at 388
Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10013. American Depositary Shares are frequently referred to as “ADSs” and represent ownership interests in securities that are on deposit with the depositary bank. ADSs are normally represented by
certificates that are commonly known as “American Depositary Receipts” or “ADRs.” The depositary bank typically appoints a custodian to safe keep the securities on deposit. In this case, the custodian is Citibank, N.A., Mumbai
Branch, located at 81 Dr. Annie Besant Road, Worli, Mumbai, India 400 018.    We have appointed Citibank as depositary bank pursuant to a deposit agreement for the ADSs. A copy of the deposit agreement is on file with the SEC as an Exhibit to this Registration Statement. You may obtain a copy
of the deposit agreement from the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549 or from the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.

Table of Contents
We are providing you with a summary description of the material terms of the ADSs and of your material
rights as an owner of ADSs. Please remember that summaries by their nature lack the precision of the information summarized and that a holder’s rights and obligations as an owner of ADSs will be determined by reference to the terms of the
deposit agreement and not by this summary. Any italicized text in this Item 12.D is provided for your information only and is not set forth in the deposit agreement. We urge you to review the deposit agreement in its entirety.    Each ADS represents the right to receive one (1) of our ordinary shares, par
value Rs.10 per share, on deposit with the custodian. An ADS will also represent the right to receive any other property received by the depositary bank or the custodian on behalf of the owner of the ADS but that has not been distributed to the
owners of ADSs because of legal restrictions or practical considerations.    If you become an owner of ADSs, you will become a party to the deposit agreement and therefore will be bound to its terms and to the terms of the ADR that represents your ADSs. The deposit agreement and the ADR
specify our rights and obligations as well as your rights and obligations as owner of ADSs and those of the depositary bank. As an ADS holder you appoint the depositary bank to act on your behalf in certain circumstances. The deposit agreement and
the ADRs are governed by New York law. However, our obligations to the holders of shares will continue to be governed by the laws of India, which may be different from the laws in the United States.    As an owner of ADSs, you may hold your ADSs by means of an ADR registered in
your name, through a brokerage or safekeeping account or in book-entry form in an account maintained on your behalf by Citibank. ADSs held in such an account are known as “direct registration ADSs”. If you decide to hold your ADSs through
your brokerage or safekeeping account, you must rely on the procedures of your broker or bank to assert your rights as ADS owner. Please consult with your broker or bank to determine what those procedures are. This summary description assumes you
have opted to own the ADSs directly by means of an ADR registered in your name and, as such, we will refer to you as the “holder.” When we refer to “you,” we assume the reader owns ADSs and will own ADSs at the relevant time.
   Dividends and Distributions    As a holder, you generally have the right to receive the distributions we
make on the securities deposited with the custodian bank. Your receipt of these distributions may be limited, however, by practical considerations and legal limitations. Holders will receive such distributions under the terms of the deposit
agreement in proportion to the number of ADSs held as of a specified record date set by the depositary bank.    Distributions of Cash    Whenever we make a cash distribution for the securities on deposit with the custodian, we will deposit the funds with the Custodian. Upon receipt of
confirmation of the deposit of the funds, the depositary bank will promptly arrange for the funds to be converted into U.S. dollars and for the distribution of the U.S. dollars to the applicable holders, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement
and applicable Indian laws and regulations.    The conversion
into dollars will take place only if practicable in the judgment of the depositary bank and if the dollars are transferable to the United States. The amounts distributed to holders will be net of the fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges
payable by holders under the terms of the deposit agreement. The depositary will apply the same method for distributing the proceeds of the sale of any property (such as undistributed rights) held by the custodian in respect of securities on
deposit.   
108 


Table of Contents
Distributions of Shares    Whenever we make a free distribution of shares for the securities on deposit with the custodian, we will deposit the
applicable number of Shares with the custodian. Upon receipt of confirmation of such deposit, the depositary bank will either distribute to holders new ADSs representing the shares deposited or modify the ADS-to-shares ratio, in which case each ADS
you hold will represent rights and interests in the additional shares so deposited. Only whole new ADSs will be distributed. Fractional entitlements will be sold by the depositary bank and the proceeds of such sale will be distributed as in the case
of a cash distribution.    The distribution of new ADSs or the
modification of the ADS-to-shares ratio upon a distribution of Shares will be made net of the fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the deposit agreement. In order to pay such taxes or governmental
charges, the depositary bank may sell all or a portion of the new Shares so distributed.    No such distribution of new ADSs will be made if it would violate a law or if it is not operationally practicable. If the depositary bank does not distribute new ADSs as described above, it may sell the shares
received upon the terms described in the deposit agreement and will distribute the proceeds of the sale as in the case of a distribution of cash.    Distributions of Rights    Whenever we intend to distribute rights to subscribe for additional shares, we will give timely notice to the depositary bank prior to the proposed
distribution stating whether or not we wish the rights to be made available to holders of ADSs. If we intend the rights to be made available to holders of ADSs, we will assist the depositary bank in determining whether it is lawful and reasonably
practicable to distribute such rights to purchase additional ADSs to holders.    The depositary bank will establish procedures to distribute rights to purchase additional ADSs to holders and to enable such holders to exercise such rights if we have timely requested that the rights be made
available to holders of ADSs, if it is lawful and reasonably practicable to make the rights available to holders of ADSs, and if we provide all of the documentation contemplated in the deposit agreement (such as opinions to address the lawfulness of
the transaction). You may have to pay fees, expenses, taxes and other governmental charges to subscribe for the new ADSs upon the exercise of your rights. The depositary bank is not obligated to establish procedures to facilitate the distribution
and exercise by holders of rights to purchase new shares other than in the form of ADSs.    The depositary bank will not distribute the rights to you if:   


 
•
We do not timely request that the rights be distributed to you or we request that the rights not be distributed to you;   


 
•
We fail to deliver satisfactory documents to the depositary bank; or   


 
•
It is not reasonably practicable (in the judgment of the depositary bank) to distribute the rights.    The depositary bank will sell the rights that are not exercised or not distributed if such sale is lawful and reasonably
practicable (in the judgment of the depositary bank). The proceeds of such sale will be distributed to holders as in the case of a cash distribution. If the depositary bank is unable to sell the rights, it will allow the rights to lapse. 
 
109 


Table of Contents
Elective Distributions    Whenever we intend to make a distribution payable at the election of shareholders either in cash or in additional shares in
accordance with applicable law, we will give timely notice thereof to the depositary bank and will indicate whether or not we wish the elective distribution to be made available to holders of ADSs. In such case, we will assist the depositary bank in
determining whether such distribution to holders of ADSs is lawful and reasonably practicable.    The depositary bank will make the election available to holders of ADSs only if we have timely requested that the distribution be made available to holders of ADSs, if the depositary bank has determined that the
distribution is reasonably practical and if we have provided satisfactory documentation as contemplated in the deposit agreement. In such case, the depositary bank will establish procedures to enable you to elect to receive either cash or additional
ADSs, in each case as described in the deposit agreement.    If
the election is not made available to you, you will receive either cash or additional ADSs, depending on what a shareholder in India would receive upon failing to make an election, as more fully described in the deposit agreement.    Other Distributions    Whenever we intend to distribute property other than cash, shares or rights
to purchase additional shares, we will timely notify the depositary bank and will indicate whether or not we wish such distribution to be made to holders of ADSs. If we notify the depositary bank that we wish such distribution to be made to holders
of ADSs, we will assist the depositary bank in determining whether such distribution to holders is lawful and reasonably practicable.    The depositary bank shall not make such distribution unless we have requested that such distribution be made to holders of ADSs, we have provided
satisfactory documentation as contemplated in the deposit agreement and the depositary has determined that such distribution is reasonably practicable. If the above conditions are satisfied, the depositary bank will establish procedures for
distribution of such property to the holders of ADSs.    The
distribution will be made net of fees, expenses, taxes and governmental charges payable by holders under the terms of the deposit agreement. In order to pay such taxes and governmental charges, the depositary bank may sell all or a portion of the
property received.    The depositary bank will not
distribute the property to ADS holders and will sell the property if:   


 
•
We do not request that the property be distributed to you;   


 
•
We do not deliver satisfactory documents to the depositary bank; or   


 
•
The depositary bank determines that all or a portion of the distribution to you is not reasonably practicable.    The proceeds of such a sale will be distributed to holders as in the case of
a cash distribution.    Redemption    Whenever we decide to redeem any of the securities on deposit with the
custodian, we will notify the depositary bank. If the depositary bank receives such notice timely, if the redemption is reasonably practicable and if we provide all of the documentation contemplated in the deposit agreement, the depositary bank will
mail notice of the redemption to the holders.   
110 


Table of Contents
The custodian will be instructed to surrender the shares being redeemed against payment of the applicable
redemption price. The depositary bank will convert the redemption funds received into dollars upon the terms of the deposit agreement and will distribute the net proceeds from the redemption to holders of ADSs so redeemed. You may have to pay fees,
expenses, taxes and other governmental charges upon the redemption of your ADSs. If less than all shares on deposit are being redeemed, the ADSs to be retired will be selected by lot or on a pro rata basis, as the depositary bank may
determine.    Changes Affecting Shares    The shares held on deposit for your ADSs may change from time to time. For
example, there may be a change in nominal or par value, a split-up, cancellation, consolidation or reclassification of such Shares or a recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of assets.    If any such change were to occur, your ADSs would, to the extent permitted by
law, represent the right to receive the property received or exchanged in respect of the Shares held on deposit. The depositary bank may in such circumstances deliver new ADSs to you or call for the exchange of your existing ADSs for new ADSs. If
the depositary bank may not lawfully distribute such property to you, the depositary bank may sell such property and distribute the net proceeds to you as in the case of a cash distribution.    Issuance of ADSs upon Deposit of Shares    The depositary bank may create ADSs on your behalf if you or your broker
deposit shares with the custodian. The depositary bank will deliver these ADSs to the person you indicate only after you pay any applicable issuance fees and any charges and taxes payable for the transfer of the shares to the custodian. Your ability
to deposit shares and receive ADSs may be limited by U.S. and Indian legal considerations applicable at the time of deposit. In particular, in accordance with applicable regulations of the Reserve Bank of India, the depositary bank will only be
able to accept additional shares for deposit into the ADS facility to the extent that there have previously been net withdrawals of shares.    The issuance of ADSs may be delayed until the depositary bank or the custodian receives confirmation that all required approvals have been given and that
the shares have been duly transferred to the custodian. The depositary bank will only issue ADSs in whole numbers.    When you make a deposit of shares, you will be responsible for transferring good and valid title to the depositary bank. As such, you will be deemed to
represent and warrant that:   


 
•
The shares are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable and legally obtained.   


 
•
All preemptive (and similar) rights, if any, with respect to such shares have been validly waived or exercised.   


 
•
You are duly authorized to deposit the shares.   


 
•
The shares presented for deposit are free and clear of any lien, encumbrance, security interest, charge, mortgage or adverse claim, and are not, and the ADSs issuable upon such
deposit will not be, “restricted securities” (as defined in the deposit agreement).   


 
•
The shares presented for deposit have not been stripped of any rights or entitlements.   
111 


Table of Contents
If any of these representations or warranties is incorrect in any way, we and the depositary bank may, at
your cost and expense, take any and all actions necessary to correct the consequences of the misrepresentations.    In addition, in order to prevent unauthorized trading of unlisted shares in India, you will be required to provide certifications as may be determined by
us to be reasonably necessary to confirm that you will not, and that you will obtain agreement from subsequent transferees not to, for a period of 45 days following your deposit, withdraw and seek to sell on any Indian Stock Exchange any such shares
if such shares have not been approved for listing and trading on the Indian Stock Exchanges at the time of such deposit.    Transfer, Combination and Split Up of ADRs    As an ADR holder, you will be entitled to transfer, combine or split up your ADRs and the ADSs evidenced thereby. For transfers of ADRs, you will have to
surrender the ADRs to be transferred to the depositary bank and also must:   


 
•
ensure that the surrendered ADR is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer;   


 
•
provide such proof of identity and genuineness of signatures as the depositary bank deems appropriate;   


 
•
provide any transfer stamps required by the State of New York or the United States; and   


 
•
pay all applicable fees, charges, expenses, taxes and other government charges payable by ADR holders pursuant to the terms of the deposit agreement, upon the transfer of ADRs.
   To have your ADRs either combined or split up,
you must surrender the ADRs in question to the depositary bank with your request to have them combined or split up, and you must pay all applicable fees, taxes, charges and expenses payable by ADR holders, pursuant to the terms of the deposit
agreement, upon a combination or split up of ADRs.    Withdrawal of Shares
Upon Cancellation of ADSs    As a holder, you will be
entitled to present your ADSs to the depositary bank for cancellation and then receive the corresponding number of underlying shares at the custodian’s offices. Your ability to withdraw the shares may be limited by U.S. and Indian legal
considerations applicable at the time of withdrawal. In order to withdraw the shares represented by your ADSs, you will be required to pay to the depositary the fees for cancellation of ADSs and any charges and taxes payable in relation to the
shares being withdrawn. You assume the risk for delivery of all funds and securities upon withdrawal. Once canceled, the ADSs will not have any rights under the deposit agreement.    If you hold an ADR registered in your name, the depositary bank may ask you to provide proof of identity and genuineness of
any signature and such other documents as the depositary bank may deem appropriate before it will cancel your ADSs. The withdrawal of the shares represented by your ADSs may be delayed until the depositary bank receives satisfactory evidence of
compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Please keep in mind that the depositary bank will only accept ADSs for cancellation that represent a whole number of securities on deposit.    You will have the right to withdraw the securities represented by your ADSs
subject to payment of fees, taxes and similar charges at any time except for:   


 
•
Temporary delays that may arise because (i) the transfer books for the shares or ADSs are closed, or (ii) shares are immobilized on account of a shareholders’ meeting or a
payment of dividends.   
112 


Table of Contents


 
•
Restrictions imposed because of laws or regulations applicable to ADSs or the withdrawal of securities on deposit.   


 
•
Any other circumstances specifically contemplated in the regulations promulgated by the SEC staff from time to time.    In addition, in order to prevent unauthorized trading of unlisted shares in
India, you may be required to certify in writing upon withdrawal of shares represented by ADSs that you will not seek to sell any withdrawn shares on any Indian Stock Exchange if less than 45 days have elapsed since the time of the deposit of such
shares into the ADS facility and such shares were not approved for listing and trading on the Indian Stock Exchanges at the time of such deposit.    In the event the securities on deposit includes shares that have not been dematerialized and listed for trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the
National Stock Exchange (i.e. on account of a delay in such listing in connection with a deposit of shares newly issued in connection with a conversion of one of our bonds), the shares withdrawn from the ADR facility will be selected first from the
shares that have been dematerialized and listed for trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange and thereafter from the shares that have not been so dematerialized and listed. Neither the custodian, the depositary bank or we
shall have any liability to any holder of ADSs who receives, upon cancellation of ADSs, any shares that have not been dematerialized and listed for trading on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange.    The deposit agreement may not be modified to impair your right to withdraw
the securities represented by your ADSs except to comply with mandatory provisions of law.    Voting Rights    Holders
of ADSs may exercise voting rights with respect to the deposited securities represented by ADSs only in accordance with the provisions of the deposit agreement and Indian law. Holders of ADSs are not entitled to attend and vote at
shareholders’ meetings. A holder of ADSs may withdraw from the ADS facility the related underlying shares and vote as a direct shareholder, but there may not be sufficient time to do so after the announcement of an upcoming vote. If
requested by us, the depositary bank will notify holders of ADSs of upcoming votes and arrange to deliver our voting materials to holders of ADSs. The materials will describe the matters to be voted on and explain how holders of ADSs as of a record
date specified by the depositary bank may instruct the depositary bank to vote the deposited securities underlying the ADSs as directed by the holders of ADSs. For the instructions to be valid, the depositary bank must receive them on or before a
date specified by the depositary bank. We have informed the depositary bank that under Indian practice (as presently in effect) proxies are to be submitted to us at least 48 hours before a shareholders’ meeting, which may result in the
depositary bank requiring the receipt of voting instructions from holders of ADSs as early as five days before the date of the meeting. The depositary bank will try, insofar as practicable, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, Indian laws
and the provisions of our Articles of Association, to vote or have its agents vote the deposited securities as instructed. If the depositary bank timely receives voting instructions from a holder of ADSs which fail to specify the manner in which the
depositary bank is to vote the deposited securities underlying such holder’s ADSs, such holder will be deemed to have instructed the depositary bank to vote in favor of the items set forth in such voting instructions. If the depositary bank
does not receive timely instructions from a holder of ADSs, the holder shall be deemed to have instructed the depositary bank to give a discretionary proxy to a person designated by us, provided that, no such discretionary proxy shall be given with
respect to any matter as to which we inform   
113 


Table of Contents
the depositary bank that we do not wish such proxy given or substantial opposition exists or the rights of holders of
ADSs will be adversely affected. If requested by us, the depositary bank is required to represent all shares underlying the outstanding ADSs, regardless of whether timely voting instructions have been received from the holders of such ADSs, for the
sole purpose of establishing a quorum at a meeting of shareholders.    Ownership Restrictions    We may restrict, in
such manner as we deem appropriate, transfers of the ADSs where such transfer may result in the total number of shares represented by the ADSs owned by a single holder to exceed limits under applicable law or under our Articles of Association. We
may instruct the depositary bank to take action with respect to the ownership interest of any holder in excess of the limits set forth in the preceding sentence, including but not limited to, the imposition of restrictions on the transfer ADSs, the
removal or limitation, of voting rights or the mandatory sale or disposition on behalf of a holder of shares represented by the ADSs held by such holder in excess of such limitations.    Fees and Charges    As an ADS holder, you will be required to pay the following service fees to the depositary bank:

Table of Contents
As an ADS holder you will also be responsible to pay certain fees and expenses incurred by the depositary
bank and certain taxes and governmental charges such as:   


 
•
Fees for the transfer and registration of shares charged by the registrar and transfer agent for the Shares in India (i.e., upon deposit and withdrawal of Shares).
  


 
•
Expenses incurred for converting foreign currency into dollars.   


 
•
Expenses for cable, telex and fax transmissions and for delivery of securities.   


 
•
Taxes and duties upon the transfer of securities (i.e., when shares are deposited or withdrawn from deposit).   


 
•
Fees and expenses incurred in connection with the delivery or servicing of shares on deposit.    The fees and charges you may be required to pay may vary over time and may be changed by us and by the depositary bank. You
will receive prior notice of such changes.    Amendments and Termination
   We may agree with the depositary bank to modify the
deposit agreement at any time without your consent. We undertake to give holders 30 days’ prior notice of any increase in any fees and charges (other than foreign exchange charges, taxes, delivery charges and other such expenses) and any other
modifications that would materially prejudice any of their substantial existing rights under the deposit agreement. We will not consider to be materially prejudicial to your substantial rights any modifications or supplements that are reasonably
necessary for the ADSs to be registered under the Securities Act or to be eligible for book-entry settlement, in each case without imposing or increasing the fees and charges you are required to pay. In addition, we may not be able to provide you
with prior notice of any modifications or supplements that are required to accommodate compliance with applicable provisions of law.    You will be bound by the modifications to the deposit agreement if you continue to hold your ADSs after the modifications to the deposit agreement become
effective. The deposit agreement cannot be amended to prevent you from withdrawing the shares represented by your ADSs (except as permitted by law).    We have the right to direct the depositary bank to terminate the deposit agreement at any time. Similarly, the depositary bank may in certain
circumstances on its own initiative terminate the deposit agreement. In either case, the depositary bank must give notice to the holders at least 30 days before termination.    Upon termination, the following will occur under the deposit agreement:   


 
•
for a period of six months after termination, you will be able to request the cancellation of your ADSs and the withdrawal of the shares represented by your ADSs and the delivery of
all other property held by the depositary bank in respect of those shares on the same terms as prior to the termination. During such six months’ period the depositary bank will continue to collect all distributions received on the shares on
deposit (i.e., dividends) but will not distribute any such property to you until you request the cancellation of your ADSs.   
115 


Table of Contents


 
•
After the expiration of such six months’ period, the depositary bank may sell the securities held on deposit. The depositary bank will hold uninvested the net proceeds from
such sale and any other funds then held for the holders of ADSs in an unsegregated account. At that point, the depositary bank will have no further obligations to holders other than to account for the funds then held for the holders of ADSs still
outstanding.    Books of Depositary    The depositary bank will maintain ADS holder records at its depositary
office. You may inspect such records at such office during regular business hours but solely for the purpose of communicating with other holders in the interest of business matters relating to the ADSs and the deposit agreement.    The depositary bank will maintain in New York facilities to record and
process the issuance, cancellation, combination, split-up and transfer of ADRs. These facilities may be closed from time to time, to the extent not prohibited by law.    Limitations on Obligations and Liabilities   
The deposit agreement limits our obligations and the depositary bank’s obligations to you. Please note the following:   


 
•
We and the depositary bank are obligated only to take the actions specifically stated in the deposit agreement without negligence or bad faith.   


 
•
The depositary bank disclaims any liability for any failure to carry out voting instructions, for any manner in which a vote is cast or for the effect of any vote, provided it acts
in good faith and in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement.   


 
•
The depositary bank disclaims any liability for any failure to determine the lawfulness or practicality of any action, for the content of any document forwarded to you on our behalf
or for the accuracy of any translation of such a document, for the investment risks associated with investing in shares, for the validity or worth of the shares, for any tax consequences that result from the ownership of ADSs, for the
credit-worthiness of any third party, for allowing any rights to lapse under the terms of the deposit agreement, for the timeliness of any of our notices or for our failure to give notice.   


 
•
We and the depositary bank will not be obligated to perform any act that is inconsistent with the terms of the deposit agreement.   


 
•
We and the depositary bank disclaim any liability if we are prevented or forbidden from acting on account of any law or regulation, any provision of our Articles of Association, any
provision of any securities on deposit or by reason of any act of God or war or terrorism or other circumstances beyond our control.   


 
•
We and the depositary bank disclaim any liability by reason of any exercise of, or failure to exercise, any discretion provided for the deposit agreement or in our Articles of
Association or in any provisions of securities on deposit.   


 
•
We and the depositary bank further disclaim any liability for any action or inaction in reliance on the advice or information received from legal counsel, accountants, any person
presenting shares for deposit, any holder of ADSs or authorized representatives thereof, or any other person believed by either of us in good faith to be competent to give such advice or information.   
116 


Table of Contents


 
•
We and the depositary bank also disclaim liability for the inability by a holder to benefit from any distribution, offering, right or other benefit which is made available to
holders of shares but is not, under the terms of the deposit agreement, made available to you.   


 
•
We and the depositary bank may rely without any liability upon any written notice, request or other document believed to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the
proper parties.   


 
•
We and the depositary bank also disclaim liability for any consequential or punitive damages for any breach of the terms of the deposit agreement.    Pre-Release Transactions    The depositary bank may, in certain circumstances, issue ADSs before
receiving a deposit of shares or release shares before receiving ADSs for cancellation. These transactions are commonly referred to as “pre-release transactions.” The deposit agreement limits the aggregate size of pre-release transactions
and imposes a number of conditions on such transactions. These transactions must be fully collateralized with a specified type of collateral and specified representations are required from brokers. The depositary bank may retain the compensation
received from the pre-release transactions.    Taxes    You will be responsible for the taxes and other governmental charges payable
on the ADSs and the securities represented by the ADSs. We, the depositary bank and the custodian may deduct from any distribution the taxes and governmental charges payable by holders and may sell any and all property on deposit to pay the taxes
and governmental charges payable by holders. You will be liable for any deficiency if the sale proceeds do not cover the taxes that are due.    The depositary bank may refuse to issue ADSs, to deliver, transfer, split and combine ADRs or to release securities on deposit until all taxes and charges
are paid by the applicable holder. The depositary bank and the custodian may take reasonable administrative actions to obtain tax refunds and reduced tax withholding for any distributions on your behalf. However, you may be required to provide to
the depositary bank and to the custodian proof of taxpayer status and residence and such other information as the depositary bank and the custodian may require to fulfill legal obligations. You are required to indemnify us, the depositary bank and
the custodian for any claims with respect to taxes based on any tax benefit obtained for you.    Foreign Currency Conversion    The depositary bank will arrange for the conversion of all foreign currency received into dollars if such conversion is practicable, and it will distribute the dollars in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement. You may have to
pay fees and expenses incurred in converting foreign currency, such as fees and expenses incurred in complying with currency exchange controls and other governmental requirements.    If the conversion of foreign currency is not practicable or lawful, or if any required approvals are denied or not
obtainable at a reasonable cost or within a reasonable period, the depositary bank may take the following actions in its discretion:   


 
•

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM    To the Board of Directors  Tata Motors Limited:    We have
audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tata Motors Limited (formerly Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited) and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2003 and 2004, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, cash flows, and shareholders’ equity for each of the years in the three year period ended March 31, 2004, all expressed in Indian rupees. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.    In our opinion, such consolidated financial
statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Tata Motors Limited and its subsidiaries as of March 31, 2003 and 2004, and the consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for each of the years
in the three year period ended March 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.    As described in Note 2 (a) to the financial statements, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, which differ in certain material respects from accounting principles generally accepted in India, which form the basis of the Company’s general purpose financial statements.    /s/ Deloitte Haskins & Sells  Mumbai  August 9, 2004

Tata Motors Limited  (formerly Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited)    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements   


1.
Background and Operations    Tata Motors Limited (or Tata Motors), together with its subsidiaries (collectively “the Company”), is India’s leading
automotive vehicle manufacturing company in terms of revenues and is one of the largest private sector companies in India in terms of revenues and assets. The Company designs, manufactures and sells a wide range of vehicles. The Company also
manufactures and sells spare parts for its vehicles and engines for industrial and marine applications, as well as construction equipment, including hydraulic excavators, cranes and wheel loaders, aggregates such as axles and transmissions for
commercial vehicles and factory automation equipment, and provides information technology services.    The Company was incorporated in India on September 1, 1945 as a public limited company under the Indian Companies Act VII of 1913 as Tata
Locomotive and Engineering Company Limited. The Company was originally formed to manufacture steam locomotives which commenced in 1952 and continued until 1970. From 1954 to 1969, the Company collaborated with Daimler-Benz AG (now DaimlerChrysler
AG) for the manufacture of automotive vehicles, and in 1960 was renamed Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Limited. The Company commenced production of passenger cars in 1991-92. In 1997-98, the Company launched the ‘Indica’, a
compact car which was designed and developed in-house and, in 2002-03, the mid-sized ‘Indigo’. The name of the Company was changed to Tata Motors Limited effective July 29, 2003.    Tata Sons Limited (or Tata Sons), together with its
subsidiaries, owns 22.6% of the Company’s shares, and has the ability to significantly influence the Company’s operations.    Tata Motors’ equity shares are listed on The Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE), the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) and three other
stock exchanges in India, and its global depositary receipts are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.   


2.
Significant Accounting Policies   


 
a.
Basis of Presentation    These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (or US GAAP). US GAAP differs in certain material respects from accounting principles generally accepted in India and the requirements of India’s Companies Act, 1956 (collectively Indian GAAP),
which form the basis of the general purpose financial statements of Tata Motors in India.    Principal differences insofar as they relate to the Company include: the identification of subsidiaries and affiliates; differences in the
measurement basis for acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method; the valuation of investments; accounting for retirement benefits, compensated absences, startup expenses, foreign exchange, debt issuance and extinguishment costs,
intangible assets, research and development costs and employee separation costs and the presentation and format of the financial statements and related notes.   


 
b.
Basis of Consolidation    The Company consolidates all entities in which it has a majority financial interest, provided control is not
impaired or temporary. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealized gains/losses on inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation.   
F-9 


Table of Contents
In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No.
141, Business Combinations, the results of subsidiaries acquired have been consolidated from the date of acquisition. Purchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. The excess of fair value
over the purchase consideration is first allocated to reduce the amounts otherwise assigned to the eligible acquired long-term assets and any excess remaining is recognized as an extraordinary gain in the income statement in the period in which the
business combination is consummated.    At March
31, 2003, subsidiaries consolidated include HV Axles Limited, HV Transmissions Limited, Tata Technologies Limited and its subsidiary, TAL Manufacturing Solutions Limited, Tata AutoComp Systems Limited (“TACO”) and its subsidiaries, Telco
Construction Equipment Company Limited, Sheba Properties Limited and its subsidiary, Concorde Motors Limited, Tata Precision Industries Pte Ltd and its subsidiary and Minicar (India) Limited. At March 31, 2004, in addition to the subsidiaries
consolidated at March 31, 2003, Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company Limited and Automotive Stampings and Assemblies Limited (which was considered an affiliate as at March 31, 2003), were also consolidated.   


 
c.
Affiliates    Entities where the Company exerts significant influence, generally where the Company controls between 20% and 50% of the voting stock of
the investee company, are considered affiliates, and are accounted for using the equity method. Inter-company unrealized gains and losses on transactions with affiliates are eliminated.   


 
d.
Use of Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of these financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the years presented. Actual results could differ from these
estimates. Material estimates in these financial statements that are susceptible to change as more information becomes available include allowances for uncollectible accounts and finance receivables, certain deferred tax assets and warranty
obligation.   


 
e.
Revenue Recognition    The Company recognizes revenues on the sale of products, net of trade discounts and rebates, when products are delivered to dealers or
when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when title and risks and rewards of ownership pass to the customer. Sales include excise duties and charges for shipping and handling to the point of delivery, and exclude indirect taxes.
   The Company recognizes revenues from services
as rendered and earned.    Revenues are
recognized when collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.    Finance and service charges are accrued on the unpaid principal balance of finance receivables using the interest method. Hire purchase
and loan receivables are placed on “non-accrual” status when interest or principal payments are four quarters and two quarters past due, respectively, at which time no further interest is accrued and overdue interest is written off against
interest income. Finance receivables are returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.    Income from assets given on operating lease is recognized on
a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms.

Cost Recognition    Costs and expenses are recognized when incurred and are classified according to their primary functions in the following categories:
   Cost of sales    These costs primarily include raw materials, employee
compensation of production personnel, depreciation and amortization of production equipment and factory overheads.    Selling, general and administrative expenses    Selling expenses primarily include employee compensation for sales and marketing personnel, travel costs,
advertising, business promotion expenses, special incentives to dealers under sales promotion schemes, allowances for delinquent receivables and outward shipping expenses. Selling expenses include outward shipping expenses of Rs. 1,753.5 million,
Rs. 1,931.7 million and Rs. 2,752.7 million for the years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.    General and administrative costs primarily include employee compensation for administrative, supervisory and managerial personnel,
depreciation and amortization of non-production equipment and software, non factory overheads including rent, insurance, electricity, telecommunication costs, legal and professional fees, amortization of goodwill and intangibles, valuation
allowances and other general expenses.    Research and development expenses    All research and development expenses are expensed when incurred. Research and development expenses include all costs relating to the Company’s Engineering Research Center (“ERC”) and all costs incurred
for the design and development of new vehicle models. The ERC’s expenses primarily consist of employee compensation for research personnel and overheads.   


 
g.
Product Warranty Expenses    The estimated liability for product warranties is recorded when products are sold. These estimates are established using historical
information on the nature, frequency and average cost of warranty claims and management estimates regarding possible future incidence based on actions on product failures.   


 
h.
Sales of Receivables    Tata Motors sells finance receivables to special purpose entities in securitization transactions. Recourse is in the form of the
Company’s investment in subordinated securities issued by these special purpose entities and cash collateral. In accordance SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, the
receivables are derecognized in the balance sheet when they are sold and consideration has been received by the Company. Sales and transfers that do not meet the criteria for surrender of control are accounted for as secured borrowings. 
  Gains or losses from the sale of receivables are
recognized in the period the sale occurs based on the relative fair value of the portion sold and the portion allocated to retained interests, and are reported net of the estimated cost of servicing by the Company’s dealers.   


 
i.
Foreign Currency    The functional currency of the Company is the Indian rupee. Foreign currency transactions are translated into Indian rupees at exchange
rates prevailing on the date of transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are converted into Indian rupees using exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet dates. Gains and losses arising on conversion of foreign
currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and on foreign currency transactions are included in net income.   
F-11 


Table of Contents
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into Indian rupees
for the purposes of consolidation as follows: income statement items have been converted at the average exchange rates during the period, and assets and liabilities have been translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Any
resulting unrealized gains or losses are reported in other comprehensive income, a separate component of shareholders’ equity.   


 
j.
Income Taxes     Income tax consists of the current tax provision and the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability for the year.    Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the
provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act of 1961 or applicable law in foreign tax jurisdictions.    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying values of
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilized business loss carry forwards. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for each taxable entity in the consolidated enterprise and for each taxable
jurisdiction. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized and are separately estimated at each such entity without offsetting.    Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be received or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income
statement in the period of enactment of the change.   


 
k.
Earnings Per Share    The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with SFAS No. 128, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings per
ordinary share has been computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the period. Partly paid up shares are included as fully paid equivalents according to the fraction paid up. Diluted earnings
per ordinary share has been computed using the weighted average number of ordinary shares and dilutive potential ordinary shares outstanding during the period using the “if-converted” method for warrants and convertible instruments, except
where the result would be antidilutive.    


 
l.
Cash and Cash Equivalents    The Company considers all highly liquid financial instruments, which are readily convertible to cash and have an original maturity on the
date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents.   


 
m.
Finance Receivables, Deferred Origination Costs and Allowance for Credit Losses    Tata Motors finances vehicle sales with hire purchase and
loan financing provided to its customers. Such contracts are accounted for as sales type leases in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and give rise to a normal manufacturer’s margin. Finance receivables are reported at
their outstanding unpaid principal balances reduced by a valuation allowance and are reported net of any deferred origination costs.    Origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to yield of the related finance
receivable.    The Company establishes a
specific and unallocated allowance for credit losses for finance receivables, in accordance with SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended by SFAS No. 118, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a
Loan—Income Recognition and Disclosures (an amendment of FASB Statement No. 114), based on management’s best estimate of losses inherent in the finance receivable portfolio.   
F-12 


Table of Contents
The Company considers a finance receivable to be impaired when, based on current
information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the financing agreement.    The Company provides a specific allowance for credit losses
for loan receivables and hire purchase receivables that are in arrears for two quarters or four quarters or more, respectively, in an amount equivalent to the outstanding principal and interest balance.    Finance receivables comprise small homogeneous balances.
Such balances are collectively evaluated for impairment at each balance sheet date and an unallocated allowance for credit losses is established based on historical losses incurred.    The allowance for credit losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon
management’s view of the probability of recovery of receivables in light of historical experience, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, amounts that may be
recoverable from originating dealers, factors affecting the industry which the receivable exposure relates to and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant
revision as more information becomes available.    Credit losses are charged against the allowance when management believes that the balance cannot be recovered. Subsequent recoveries and proceeds from auctions of repossessed vehicles are credited to the allowance.    Repossessed Vehicles    Vehicles repossessed from delinquent financing customers and
held for auction are recorded at the lower of the unpaid principal balance and estimated net realizable value. Gains or losses on disposal are recorded when the vehicles are sold.   


 
n.
Inventories    Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost of raw materials and components is ascertained on a moving
weighted average / monthly moving weighted average basis. Cost of work in progress and finished goods are determined on a full absorption cost basis.   


 
o.
Concentrations of Credit Risk    Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of cash and cash
equivalents, debt securities, accounts receivable and loans and advances. None of the financial instruments result in material concentrations of credit risk.   


 
p.
Investments    The Company accounts for its investments in debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable market values in accordance
with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities.    The Company does not have any securities classified as trading.    Debt securities for which management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified
as held-to-maturity securities and are reported at amortized cost.    Debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable fair market values that are not classified as held-to-maturity, and retained interests in sold receivables are classified as available-for-sale and
recorded at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on such securities, net of applicable taxes, are reported in other comprehensive income, a separate component of shareholders’ equity.   
F-13 


Table of Contents
Retained interests in sold receivables are initially measured at fair value determined by
an external credit rating process considering various factors; principally, the expected credit losses, the age of the receivables portfolio, expected prepayments and the credit rating of the Company. These retained interests are not quoted and
therefore, subsequent fair values are determined based on a valuation model that takes account of various assumptions such as the shortfall in collections, prepayments, the age of the portfolio and other assumptions. These fair values are usually
certified by the special purpose entities.    Equity securities that do not have readily determinable market values are accounted for in accordance with APB Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, and are carried at original cost.
   Declines in the fair values below cost that
are other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses.    The cost in respect of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method.   


 
q.
Property, Plant and Equipment    Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation.    Cost includes the purchase price, taxes and duties, labor
cost and direct overheads for self constructed assets and other direct costs incurred up to the date the asset is available for use.    Interest cost incurred for constructed assets is capitalized up to the date the asset is available for use based on borrowings incurred
specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings if no specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset.    Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates prescribed by the Indian Companies Act, which approximate estimated useful
lives. Estimated useful lives of the assets are as follows:   






 Type of Asset
  
 Estimated useful life (years)

 Factory building
  
20 to 40

 Plant and equipment costing less than Rs. one million
  
9

 Other plant and equipment
  
9 to 20

 Computers
  
3 to 6

 Vehicles
  
3 to 10

 Furniture and fixtures
  
3 to 20
   Depreciation on assets taken on capital lease is provided over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the primary period of the lease.    Depreciation is not provided on capital work-in-progress until construction and installation are complete
and the asset is ready for its intended use.    In respect of the assets of the Company whose estimated useful lives are revised, the unamortized depreciable amount is expensed prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.   


 
r.
Leases    Assets acquired under capital leases are initially recognized at the lower of the fair value of the leased assets at inception and the
present value of minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the outstanding liability. Finance charges are allocated to periods during the lease term at a constant periodic rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability.   
F-14

s.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets    Whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the Company subjects such
assets to a test of recoverability based on the undiscounted cash flows from use or disposition of the asset. If the asset is impaired, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the lower
of its fair value and net realizable value. As of March 31, 2003 and 2004, none of the Company’s long-lived assets was considered impaired.     In addition, the un-depreciated cost of any assets that are abandoned or plant that relates to discontinued models is expensed.
  


 
t.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets    Purchased intangible assets, other than goodwill, primarily consist of technology know-how that is valued at
acquisition cost and is amortized over its useful life of two to six years.    Purchased goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are capitalized. Such intangibles are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or when significant events occur that indicate that
the fair value is less than its carrying value. The Company determines fair value by estimating the present value of expected future cash flows.    


 
u.
Derivative Instruments    Tata Motors is party to a variety of foreign exchange rate, interest rate and foreign currency forward contracts entered into to manage
its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The counter party is generally a bank. These financial exposures are managed in accordance with the corporate risk management policies and procedures.    The Company enters into interest rate swaps, and interest
rate currency swap agreements mainly to convert its fixed-rate debt to variable-rate debt or vice versa. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The Company uses interest rate
derivatives or currency swap agreements to hedge exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on principal and interest payments for borrowings denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company.    Although these contracts are effective as hedges from an
economic perspective, they do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, as amended, as they are not designated as hedges.    Derivative financial instruments are reported as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet, at fair value. Changes in fair value are
reported in earnings. Fair values of derivative financial instruments are generally based on quoted market prices or quotations obtained from inter-bank market participants.   


 
v.
Employee Benefits    Gratuity / Pension    The Company has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering eligible employees. The plan provides for a
lump sum payment to vested employees at retirement, death while in employment or on termination of employment in an amount equivalent to 15 to 30 days salary payable for each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon completion of five years of
service. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries make annual contributions to gratuity funds established as trusts. Concorde Motors and TACO and its subsidiaries have obtained insurance policies with the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The
Company accounts for the liability for future gratuity benefits in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers’ Accounting for Pensions, based on an independent actuarial valuation carried out annually. The Company has an obligation towards
severance indemnity, a defined benefit retirement plan, covering eligible employees in Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company Limited in Korea. The plan provides for a lump sum payment to all employees with more than one year of employment
equivalent to 30 days’ salary payable for each completed year of service.   
F-15 


Table of Contents
Superannuation    The Company has two superannuation plans, a defined benefit
plan and a defined contribution plan. An eligible employee on April 1, 1996 could elect to be a member of either plan.    Employees who are members of the defined benefit superannuation plan are entitled to benefits depending on the years of service and salary
drawn. The monthly pension benefits after retirement range from 0.75% to 2% of the annual basic salary for each year of service. The Company accounts for the liability for future benefits under the plan in accordance with SFAS No. 87, based on an
independent actuarial valuation carried out annually. The Company makes contributions to a trust at 15% of the salary.    With effect from April 1, 2003, this plan was amended and benefits earned by covered employees have been protected as at March 31, 2003.
Employees covered by this plan are prospectively entitled to benefits computed on a basis that ensures that the annual cost of providing the pension benefits would not exceed 15% of salary, and therefore, has become a defined contribution plan.
   Under the defined contribution plan, the
Company maintains a separate irrevocable trust for employees covered and entitled to benefits. The Company contributes up to 15% of the eligible employees’ salary to the trust every year. The Company recognizes such contributions as an expense
when incurred. The Company has no further obligation beyond this contribution.    Bhavishya Kalyan Yojana (BKY)    Bhavishya Kalyan Yojana is an unfunded defined benefit plan. The benefits of the plan accrue to an eligible employee at the time of death or permanent disablement, while in service, either as a result of an injury or
as certified by the Company’s Medical Board. The monthly payment to dependents of the deceased/disabled employee under the plan equals 50% of the salary drawn at the time of death or accident or a specified amount, whichever is more. The
Company accounts for the liability for future benefits under the scheme in accordance with SFAS No. 87, based on an independent actuarial valuation carried out annually.    Post-retirement Medicare Scheme    Under this Scheme, employees get medical benefits for ten to twenty years from the date of retirement
depending on their grade at the time of retirement. Employees separated from the Company as part of an early separation scheme, on medical grounds, or due to permanent disablement are also covered.    In respect of executive grade employees, the scheme is
contributory and provides for annual reimbursement of medical expenses by the Company up to a certain limit.    The liability for post retirement medical benefits for executive grade employees is based on an external actuarial valuation in accordance
with SFAS No. 106, Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions.    All non-executive grade employees are members of a ‘group mediclaim scheme’ and the Company pays insurance premiums to an
insurance company every year in respect of retired employees and their spouses. All claims under the scheme are payable by the insurance carrier. As the risk in such cases has been transferred to the insurance carrier, the Company does not record a
liability for this scheme except to the extent of any premiums payable.   
F-16 


Table of Contents
Measurement date    The measurement date of all the retirement plans is March
31.    Provident fund 
  In accordance with Indian law, eligible employees of the
Company are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund, a defined contribution plan in which both the employee and employer contribute monthly at a determined rate (currently up to 12% of employee’s salary). These contributions are
either made to a fund set up as an irrevocable trust, or to the respective Regional Provident Fund Commissioners, or the Central Provident Fund under the state pension scheme, and are expensed as incurred. The Company is generally liable for future
provident fund benefits to the extent of its annual contribution and any shortfall in fund assets based on government specified minimum rates of return, and recognizes such contributions and shortfall, if any, as an expense in the year incurred.
   Compensated absences 
  The Company provides for the cost of vacation earned
based on the number of days of unutilized leave at each balance sheet date.   


 
w.
Long Term Debt     The Company reports long-term debt at the outstanding principal balance. The proceeds from debt issued with detachable warrants is
allocated between the debt instrument and the warrant based on the relative fair values of the two instruments determined by reference to quoted market prices. The proceeds from convertible debt which has a beneficial conversion feature at inception
is allocated between the host contract and the option based on the intrinsic value of the option. Amounts allocated to warrants are reported as additional paid in capital. Amounts allocated to any beneficial conversion features are deferred and
amortized as a yield adjustment using the interest method over the life of the debt.    


 
x.
Debt Issuance Costs     Issuance costs of long-term debt are amortized over the tenure of the debt.   


 
y.
Dividends    Any dividends declared by Tata Motors are based on the profits available for distribution as reported in the unconsolidated statutory
financial statements of Tata Motors prepared in accordance with Indian GAAP. Accordingly, in certain years the net income reported in these financial statements may not be fully distributable. As at March 31, 2003 and 2004, the amounts available for
distribution were Rs.9,906.6 million and Rs.15,311.7 million, respectively. Subsequent to March 31, 2004, the Company has declared and paid dividend of Rs. 4 per share in respect of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2004.   


 
z.
Comprehensive Income    The Company reports comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS No.130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Accounting principles
generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, translation adjustments arising on the consolidation of foreign subsidiaries, additional
minimum pension liability and net income are components of comprehensive income.   


 
aa.
Segments    The Company operates in one identified reportable segment, namely Automotive. Other operating segments do not meet the quantitative
thresholds for disclosure and have been aggregated. Segment information has been provided in Note 24.

   The
table below outlines the economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of retained interests in finance receivables at March 31, 2004 to immediate 10% and 20% changes in those assumptions:

   The
discount rate used for the valuation of retained interests is the rate of return to the transferees of the various pools of securitized receivables and, therefore, is not subject to change. The weighted average life in years of the securitized
receivables is also not subject to change except in case of change in the prepayment rate assumption. Consequently, the above sensitivity analysis does not include the impact on the estimated fair values of the retained interests due to adverse
change in the weighted average life in years or the discount rate.    The above sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with appropriate caution. A 10% change in the assumptions may not result in lineally proportionate changes in the fair values of retained interests. Adverse
changes assumed in the above analysis and resultant changes in the fair values of retained interests are calculated independently of each other. In reality, any change in one factor may cause changes in the other factors.

   Valuation allowances have been created for deferred tax assets arising at subsidiaries that are making losses and that do not expect a return to tax profitability in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if
they arise in the same legal entity and taxing jurisdiction but not otherwise.    Under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, unabsorbed business losses expire eight years after the year in which they originate whereas
unabsorbed depreciation allowances can be carried forward indefinitely. In respect of a foreign subsidiary in Singapore the unabsorbed business losses can be carried forward indefinitely unless there is a substantial change in the ownership.

Employee separation compensation    Tata Motors and some of its subsidiary companies offered voluntary separation to employees under an early separation scheme during the years ended March
2002, 2003 and 2004. The scheme provided for payment of pension based on salary drawn at the time of separation and certain medical benefits up to the age of normal superannuation. Compensation payable to the separated employees is accounted for
based on an independent actuarial valuation.    The number of
employees who accepted voluntary separation under the scheme were 1,889, 87 and 542 in each of the years ended March 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively.

   The Company’s
policy and objective for plan asset management is to maximize return on plan assets to meet future benefit payment requirements while at the same time accepting only a low level of risk. The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on
investment criteria approved under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, and is also subject to other exposure limitations. The Company evaluates the risks, transaction costs and liquidity for potential investments. To measure plan asset performance, the
Company compares actual returns for each asset category with published benchmarks.    The Company expects to contribute Rs. 484.9 million and Rs. 67.8 million to the gratuity and superannuation plans, respectively during the fiscal year ending on March 31, 2005.

Acquisitions    On March 30, 2004 the Company entered into an investment agreement to acquire all the equity interest in Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle
Company Limited (formerly known as Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company Limited), for a purchase consideration of Rs. 2,462.5 million. The fair value of the net assets acquired of Rs. 2,462.5 million represent approximately 2.2% of total assets of the
Company. Rs.684.9 million of the purchase consideration has been placed in an escrow account for indemnifying the Company against liabilities that may arise within two years of acquisition.    TDWCV manufactures commercial vehicles in a higher
horsepower and torque category than Tata Motors’ products, and provides Tata Motors with complementary products in this category. This acquisition also enables Tata Motors to enter the Korean market with its range of products that are not
manufactured by TDWCV. Further, both Tata Motors and TDWCV expect to gain product and market synergies as well as synergy in other areas like vehicle integration and product development through existing research and development activities.
   On March 27, 2004, the Company acquired a
further 48.81% financial interest in Automotive Stampings and Assemblies Limited (ASAL) for a consideration of Rs. 298.7 million. As a result, ASAL became an 81.35% owned subsidiary of the Company. ASAL is engaged in the manufacture of automotive
components. The acquisition results in a vertical integration of the Company’s manufacturing process. The Company acquired net assets of Rs. 193.0 million and goodwill on acquisition amounted to Rs. 105.7 million.

   Proforma information related to these acquisitions has not been included as the impact of these acquisitions, either individually or in aggregate, on the Company’s consolidated results of operations is not considered to be material.
   During the year ended March 31, 2003, the
Company invested a further Rs. 200 million in Concorde Motors Limited; as a result, Concorde became a 54.8% owned subsidiary of the Company. The purpose of the transaction was to strengthen the Company’s capability to market and provide after
sales service for passenger cars. The Company acquired net assets of Rs. 146.1 million and goodwill on acquisition amounted to Rs. 53.9 million.    During the year ended March 31, 2003, the Company also made additional investments of Rs. 12.8 million in Tata Precision Industries Pte.
Limited (Singapore) (“TPIL”) as a result of which, TPIL became a subsidiary. The Company acquired net assets of Rs. 6.1 million and goodwill on acquisition amounted to Rs. 6.7 million. Prior to the additional investment, TPIL was an
affiliate of the Company. The carrying value of TPIL as an affiliate was Rs. 10.8 million including goodwill of Rs. 10.3 million.

Commitments and contingencies    In the normal course, the Company faces claims and assertions by various parties. The Company assesses such claims and assertions and
monitors the legal environment on an ongoing basis, with the assistance of external legal counsel wherever necessary. The Company records a liability for any claims where a potential loss is probable and capable of being estimated, and discloses
such matters in its financial statements if material. For potential losses that are considered reasonably possible, but not probable, the Company provides disclosure in the financial statements, but does not record a liability in its accounts unless
the loss becomes probable.    The following is a
description of claims and assertions where a potential loss is reasonably possible, but not probable. Management believes that none of the contingencies described below, either individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.    Litigation    Tata
Motors is involved in legal proceedings in various states in India, both as plaintiff and as defendant. In respect of claims against the Company below Rs. 50 million, the majority of cases pertain to motor accident claims (involving vehicles that
met with accidents while being transferred from the Company’s manufacturing plants to regional sales offices) and consumer complaints. Some of these cases relate to replacement of parts of vehicles and/or compensation for deficiency in the
services by the Company or its dealers. Management believes that none of these claims or actions individually or in the aggregate will have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition.    The Company is also defending other claims that are above Rs. 50 million in
value but which management does not believe to be of material nature, other than those described below.

Income Tax    The Company has ongoing disputes with income tax authorities relating to tax treatment of certain items.
These mainly include disallowed expenses, tax treatment of certain expenses claimed by the Company as deductions, and the computation of, or eligibility for, certain tax incentives or allowances. Some of the disputes are of timing in nature and as
such, these are claimable in the subsequent periods.    Most of these disputes/disallowances, being repetitive in nature, have been raised by the department consistently in most of the years.    The Company has a right of appeal to the appellate authorities against adverse initial assessments to the High Court or the Supreme Court
for matters involving question of law. The income tax authorities have similar rights of appeal.    As of March 31, 2004, the Income tax department has disallowed deductions aggregating Rs. 672.5 million, which are being contested by the
Company on appeal. There are matters amounting to Rs. 630 million in respect of which the Company has won appeals that have been further contested by the Income tax authorities before higher appellate authorities.    Excise Duty    As on March 31, 2004, there were pending litigations on
various counts involving demands of Rs. 446 million. These demands were raised challenging the basis of valuation of the Company’s products and denial of the ‘Central value added tax’ (CENVAT) on inputs.    Included in Rs. 446 million are excise demands of Rs. 190.0
million, raised by the excise authorities, where the Company had won the appeals that have been further contested by the excise authorities.    The Company has received a demand of Rs. 22.3 million from the excise authorities challenging the basis of ascertaining the assessable
value of certain vehicles. An appeal to the Tribunal was decided against the Company. The Company has filed an appeal before the Supreme Court challenging the Tribunal’s decision. The Company has been advised by its legal counsel that there is
a reasonable certainty that the case would be decided in favor of the Company.    Due to an amendment to the Central Excise Rules in 1995, the excise authorities have raised a demand on the Company of Rs. 81.1 million
relating to utilization of modvat (modified value added tax) credit. The case is pending before the Tribunal. The Company has been advised by its legal counsel that the Company has rightfully claimed the credit under the excise regulations.
   The Excise authorities have denied CENVAT
credit of Rs. 47 million on certain accessories supplied with the vehicles. The matter is being contested by the Company before the Appellate authorities. The Company has been advised that on the basis of judicial precedence in its own case, the
case is likely to be decided in favor of the Company.    Sales
tax    The total sales tax demands
(including interest and penalty), which are being contested by the Company amount to Rs. 2,443.1 million as at March 31, 2004. Following are the major cases being contested by the Company:    Tata Cummins Limited (“TCL”), an affiliate of Tata
Motors, manufactures internal combustion engines and sells them principally to Tata Motors. Sales tax authorities have denied exemption of Rs. 1,169 million claimed by TCL from sales tax on finished products and from the purchase tax on raw
materials, being incentives given by the State government to new industries set up in specified area, which TCL had passed on to Tata Motors. TCL’s claim has been upheld by the High Court in August 2003. An appeal filed by the State government
against this decision is pending before the Supreme Court.

Under the sales tax laws applicable in different States of India, different rates of
sales tax are applicable on sales of vehicles. The sales tax authorities in certain states have raised disputes totaling up to Rs. 658.5 million treating the stock transfers of vehicles from the Company’s works to sales offices and the
transfers between two sales offices as inter-state sales liable for levy of sales tax.    The sales tax authorities at Patna had raised a demand of Rs. 188.5 million on ‘Best Judgment Assessment’. The Company has filed
appeals against the order before the appellate authorities.    Under the Notification issued by the State Government of Jaipur, vehicles having gross weight of more than 8,000 kgs were classified for certain tax rate. The Jaipur sales tax authorities have raised a demand of Rs.
120.6 million on the ground that our bare chassis weight being less than 8,000 kgs do not fall under relevant tax entry. The Gross Vehicle Weight of the vehicle was not considered by the sales tax authorities.    Other sales tax cases where the sales tax department has
raised demands aggregating Rs. 306.5 million mostly relate to certain procedural requirements, e.g. non-submission of declaration forms etc. The Company has since collected the required forms from the customers and submitted to the departments
concerned.    Other taxes and dues    Other amounts for which the Company may be liable
contingently aggregating Rs. 1,218.5 million include the following:    Municipal authorities in certain states levy octroi duty (a local indirect tax) on goods brought inside municipal limits at rates that are based on classification of goods. A demand of Rs. 533.9 million is currently
pending before the High Court in connection with the higher octroi duties claimed on account of classification disputes relating to components purchased by the Company for the manufacture of vehicles. Management, based on the opinion from the legal
counsel obtained in September 2001, is of the view that the probability of the claim succeeding is remote. Consequently, provision made for octroi prior to fiscal 2002 has been written back to earnings (See note 17). On July 9, 2004, the High Court
of Judicature at Bombay accepted the contention of the Company that, prima facie, spare parts and components of vehicles are different and, therefore, components of vehicles cannot be brought in for levy of octroi duty at the higher 2% rate, and has
referred the case to a larger Bench for adjudication.    Other claims    There is a
pending counter claim for approximately £ 4.4 million, by Motor Vehicles Industries Limited, in connection with legal proceedings brought by Tata Motors and Tata International Limited, Mumbai in respect of alleged breaches of a distributorship
arrangement. Recently, Leeds District Registry has passed order in favor of the Company and has initiated proceedings to wind down Motor Vehicles Industries Limited.    Guarantees    The Company provided a letter of undertaking to a bank for extending a loan of USD 51.4 million (Rs. 2,230.8 million) to TDWCV. Under the
terms of the letter of undertaking, if TDWCV is unable to repay the loan, the Company shall take appropriate steps to ensure immediate repayment of the outstanding debt including, without limitation, infusion of additional equity or incurrence of
additional debt.    The Company has entered into
an agreement with ICICI bank under which it is obliged to purchase or arrange to purchase preference shares amounting to Rs. 1,500 million issued by Tata Finance Limited (“TFL”) and held by ICICI Bank if TFL fails to perform under its
indenture for the preference shares. The term of this guarantee is 23 months. In the event of a default by TFL, the maximum potential loss that the Company would incur is Rs. 1,500 million plus interest accrued from the date of default by TFL until
the date the guarantee is upheld and payment is made by the Company. The terms of the guarantee do not provide for any recourse provision. The management believes that the likelihood of TFL not redeeming these debentures is remote and, therefore,
the Company has not recognized any liability in respect of this guarantee.

Table of Contents
The Company has provided bank guarantees aggregating Rs. 1,192 million relating to
certain securitized receivables to certain special purpose entities (‘SPE’). The Company’s liability would crystallize in the event customers fail to fulfill their obligations under the contract and the SPE serves a notice of
shortfall in collections on the Company. The term of each guarantee depends upon the weighted average term of each pool of finance receivables securitized. In the event the guarantee is invoked, the Company has the right against the borrower to
repossess the vehicle financed and to auction the vehicle. The maximum potential amount of future payment the Company would be required to make is Rs. 1,192 million as at March 31, 2004. The Company has recognized a liability of Rs. 137.5 million
for this guarantee.    The Company has
guaranteed Rs. 14.2 million to a customer for making payment directly instead of to a Consignment Agent, who had gone into liquidation due to financial crisis. The liability on the Company would crystallize in the event the Consignment Agent lodges
a claim against the customer for non payment of his invoices. The Company has recourse against the Consignment Agent. The term of the guarantee is for three years. The maximum potential amount of the future payment the Company would be required to
make is Rs. 14.2 million as at March 31,2004. The Company has recognized a full liability for this guarantee.    Commitments    The Company has entered into various contracts with vendors and contractors for the purchase of machinery, tools and equipment and various
civil contracts of a capital nature aggregating Rs. 2,405 million, which are yet to be executed.    Bill discounting    In respect of bills and export sales on deferred credit, which have been discounted with banks, the Company is contingently liable for a
sum of Rs. 4,607 million in the event customers fail to pay the banks as scheduled.    Product warranties    Estimated warranty costs are accrued at the time vehicles are sold, based primarily on historical warranty claim experience.    The following is a tabular reconciliation of the product warranty accrual for the year ended March 31, 2003 and 2004:

   The
carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term deposits, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, acceptances, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and short-term debt approximate their
fair values due to the short-terms of these instruments.    The fair value of finance receivables is estimated by discounting expected cash flows using rates at which loans of similar credit quality and maturity would be made as of March 31, 2003 and 2004.    Available-for-sale securities are carried at their fair
values, which are generally based on market price quotations. Fair values of investments classified as held-to-maturity have been determined by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate as at the balance sheet dates of similar
investments. The fair values of the investments carried at cost cannot be reasonably estimated. The fair values of borrowings have been estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate equivalent to the risk free rate of
return adjusted for the market spread required by Tata Motors’ lenders for instruments of the given maturity.    Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments; however, there are inherent weaknesses in any
estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts Tata Motors could have realized in a sales transaction as of either March 31,
2003 or 2004. The estimated fair value amounts for the years ended March 31, 2003 and 2004 have been measured as of the respective year ends, and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to those
respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than the amounts reported at each year-end.   


23.
Derivative financial instruments and risk management    On April 1, 2001, Tata Motors adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and
interpreted, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and requires that all derivatives be recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, including embedded derivatives.

Segment reporting    SFAS No.131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related information, establishes standards for reporting information
about operating segments in financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision
making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Tata Motors’ chief operating decision makers are a committee of directors.    Tata Motors primarily operates in the Automotive segment. The Automotive segment includes all activities
relating to development, design, manufacture, assembly and sale of vehicles as well as related parts and accessories. The Company evaluates segment performance of this operating segment based on standalone net income of the segment and generally
accounts for inter-segment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties. Revenues are allocated between ‘within India’ and ‘exports’ based on the location of the dealer/customer.    The Company’s other segment comprises primarily
activities relating to production, designing and selling of automotive components, construction equipment, engineering solutions and software operations. None of the other operating segments meets the quantitative thresholds specified in SFAS No.
131, and accordingly, have been aggregated.

7% convertible debentures issued by the Company during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2002, convertible into 1,992 ordinary shares, were outstanding on March 31, 2002 and have not been included in the computation of diluted EPS, as these would have
been anti-dilutive.    Detachable warrants
convertible into 25,570,421 and 25,571,218 ordinary shares issued with the Company’s debentures were outstanding on March 31, 2002 and 2003, respectively and have not been included in the computation of diluted EPS for those years as these
would have been anti-dilutive. These warrants could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future.    Zero Coupon Convertible Notes due for redemption on April 27, 2009 and 1% Convertible Notes issued on April 27, 2004, would have changed
the potential ordinary shares outstanding as at March 31, 2004, had these notes been issued before the fiscal year end.

   The following are the
principal differences between US GAAP and Indian GAAP that apply to us:    a. Consolidation of subsidiaries and equity accounting for affiliates    While both US GAAP and Indian GAAP require consolidation of subsidiaries, the basis for determining whether an investee is a subsidiary or an affiliate is
different. US GAAP requires the consolidation of entities where we have a direct or indirect majority voting interest or if we are a primary beneficiary in a variable interest entity. Indian GAAP requires the consolidation of entities where we
exercise control through a direct holding or through another subsidiary. As a result, three entities, namely Tata AutoComp Systems, Concorde Motors and Tata Precision Industries have been treated as subsidiaries under US GAAP, whereas under Indian
GAAP these entities are accounted for as equity method affiliates. In addition, the amounts consolidated under US GAAP are the US GAAP earnings of these entities, whereas the equity method amounts included in the Indian GAAP consolidated financial
statements are their Indian GAAP results.    Net assets acquired
are considered at book value under Indian GAAP. The excess of book value of net assets acquired over the purchase consideration is recognized as capital reserve under shareholders’ equity under Indian GAAP. Net assets acquired are considered at
fair values under US GAAP. The excess of fair values of net assets acquired over the purchase consideration is first allocated to reduce the amounts otherwise assigned to the eligible acquired long-term assets and any excess remaining is recognized
as extraordinary income under US GAAP.   
A-2 


Table of Contents
b. Property, plant and equipment    Under US GAAP, all foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are
included in net income, and are not includible in interest cost that may be capitalized during the construction period. Under Indian GAAP, foreign exchange gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated borrowings that are incurred to
acquire fixed assets are included in the cost of the asset and depreciated over its remaining useful life, and any such exchange gains or losses arising during the construction period are included in borrowing costs capitalizable as a part of the
cost of the asset.    Under Indian GAAP, the cost of fixed assets
also includes indirect pre-operative expenses that are incurred before a constructed plant is ready for its intended use. Under US GAAP, such costs are expensed as incurred.    Under US GAAP, any plant relating specifically to a vehicle model that has been discontinued or abandoned is subject to
impairment testing, and if impaired, is written off. Under Indian GAAP, mandatory impairment testing is required with effect from April 1, 2004.    Depreciation and related deferred income taxes relating to the above differences in the cost of property, plant and equipment between US GAAP and Indian
GAAP have also been adjusted.    c. Deferred revenue
expenses    Under US GAAP, expenses relating to
the development of new vehicle models and all startup costs are expensed as incurred. Under Indian GAAP, such costs are capitalized as deferred revenue expenses and are amortized.    Deferred revenue expenses also include employee separation cost. Under US GAAP, expenses relating to voluntary employee
separation programs are expensed when employees accept a separation offer. Under Indian GAAP, these costs are deferred and amortized.    d. Compensated absences    Under US GAAP, a liability for compensated absences is established based on leave earned but not utilized at each balance sheet date, and changes in the
liability are included in net income. Under Indian GAAP, a liability is established for the actuarially determined present value of the amount expected to be paid.    e. Retirement benefits    Under both US GAAP and Indian GAAP, a liability is established for the actuarially determined present value of future
pension benefits and for post retirement benefits other than pensions. However, actuarial methods and the basis for selecting actuarial assumptions, primarily the discount rate, differ under US GAAP and Indian GAAP, resulting in different estimates
of the liability at each balance sheet date.    Under US GAAP,
the discount rate is based on the rate at which pension obligations could be settled, which in turn references high quality corporate bonds available in the market. Under Indian GAAP, the discount rate is selected at the discretion of a professional
actuary in accordance with a variety of factors specified in the Actuarial Society of India’s Guidance Note 11. Generally the discount rates in India would be based on typical yields in a funded portfolio of assets, and are not benchmarked to
any financial instruments available in the market.   
A-3 


Table of Contents
Additionally, a pension liability under US GAAP is measured at the start of the fiscal year and US GAAP
permits certain items to be amortized over a number of years. Under Indian GAAP, pension liabilities are measured as at the balance sheet date, and Indian GAAP does not permit deferral of actuarial gains and losses.    f. Imputation of interest    Under US GAAP, interest is imputed for notes receivable or payable, such as
our sales tax deferral loan, where the stated rate of interest differs from the market rate applicable to the Company. Under Indian GAAP, such interest cost or income is generally not recognized in the financial statements.    g. Debt issue expenses    Under US GAAP debt issue expenses are amortized over the life of the
instrument using the interest method. Under Indian GAAP such expenses are either charged directly to the Securities Premium Account or are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over five years.    h. Loss on early extinguishment of debt
   Under US GAAP, any loss arising on the early
extinguishment of debt is reported as an expense. Under Indian GAAP, losses on early redemptions of certain debt instruments may be charged directly to the Securities Premium Account.    i. Interest on debt with detachable warrants    Under US GAAP, the proceeds from the issue of debt with a detachable stock
purchase warrant are allocated between the debt and the warrant based on their respective fair values. Additionally, under US GAAP, the proceeds of debt issued with a beneficial conversion feature at inception are allocated to the host contract and
the embedded option based on the intrinsic value of the conversion feature at inception. Under Indian GAAP, such allocations are not made. Accordingly, the yield on debt with detachable warrants or debt with beneficial conversion features at
inception under US GAAP is higher than it would be under Indian GAAP.    j. Deferred tax    Under US
GAAP, a deferred tax liability is established for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis and the carrying value of assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to establish deferred tax liabilities is the enacted tax rate
expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse. Under Indian GAAP, a deferred tax liability is established for the tax effect of timing differences between book and tax income for the year, at the “substantially enacted” tax rate
applicable on the balance sheet date. In addition, in the US GAAP financial statements, any deferred tax effect of other US GAAP to Indian GAAP differences is also recognized.    k. Valuation of investments    Under US GAAP, investments are classified into trading, held to maturity or available for sale, based on management’s
holding intent on the date of acquisition. We do not have any trading investments. Available for sale investments, consisting of debt securities and equity securities with readily determinable   
A-4 


Table of Contents
market values, are carried at their fair values with any unrealized gains or losses recorded in accumulated comprehensive
income, a component of shareholders’ equity. Held to maturity investments are carried at amortized cost. Equity securities without a readily determinable market value are carried at cost. An impairment loss is recognized for any impairment that
is other than temporary.    Under Indian GAAP, investments are
classified into current and long-term investments. Current investments are carried at the lower of cost or market, while long term investments are carried at cost less any impairments that are other than temporary.    l. Dividends    Under US GAAP, dividends payable are recorded as a liability when declared.
Under Indian GAAP, dividends payable are recorded as a liability in the year to which they relate.
