Bedding

A good night’s sleep is important – make sure that every member of your family rests easy with top quality bedding sets that are attractive, durable and comfortable. Start with a sturdy mattress and pillow protectors along with the proper pillows then add sheets and pillowcases to suit your taste; use quilts and comforters to wrap yourself. The bedroom can be an oasis of quiet and comfort, free of any distractions which may impede sleep.

Storage & Cleaning

Resolved to get organized? Make it happen with the right closet organizers and storage containers including special baskets, bins, shelves, drawers, carts and bags - there’s something designed for every room of the house, the garage, the yard and even the car. Part of getting organized involves cleaning - the right vacuum cleaners can really help to make a difference. Find canister, stick and robotic vacuums and make a clean sweep; steam cleaners, brooms, mops and dusters help to tackle the tough stuff. Laundry management is a daily concern – take charge with hampers and sorters, drying racks, irons, steamers and more. Clean and refresh garments with the SWASH™  clothing system, which reduces the need for dry cleaning by up to 50%. A well-organized home stocked with the proper cleaning supplies and equipment is easy to manage; make housework fun, easy and rewarding.

Bed Bath & Beyond Products Are Still Cheaper Than Amazon - Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Bed Bath & Beyond Products Are Still Cheaper Than AmazonJun. 7.17 | About: Bed Bath (BBBY) Sophocles Sophocleous CFA, value, long/short equityFatAlphaSummaryThe company has had a very long and strong history of growth, profitability and operating returns.Margins continue to be the major question mark; however, the peak rate of decline may be behind us.The stock appears to have overshot to the downside and trades at a significant discount to valuation.Online sales continue to expand at a 20%+ rate. The company's products, on average, are cheaper than Amazon even without a coupon. Savings are even larger with coupons or loyalty membership.Summary Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) is not the next Radio Shack or Blockbuster, but a company with historically strong fundamentals and cash flow generation. Its product pricing is already on par with and even cheaper than Amazon, while the market has overshot to the downside. The stock, at minimum, should be on every value investor's watch list. The Business Bed Bath & Beyond is a retail giant with a household focus. It has over $12 billion in sales, 8+ brands and 1500+ stores. Brands include the namesake Bed Bath & Beyond, Cost Plus World Market (household items), buybuy BABY (products for babies and young children), Christmas Tree Shops (seasonal/discounted/overstock items), Harmon Face Values (cosmetics/beauty), decorist (online decorators), Personalization Mall (personalized gifts), Of a Kind (unique limited production pieces from new designers) and One Kings Lane (home decor). Each brand has its own unique character, and the products carried do differ. For example, at World Market you can pick up a chicken coop. Not the sort of item I've seen at Bed Bath & Beyond. 

 A positive about the company is that it doesn't overspend on acquisitions. One Kings Lane was valued at $900 million during its 2014 funding but was acquired for under $30 million. The company also takes the brands and builds on them. For example, buybuy BABY had 9 stores in 2008, and the company has grown the brand to 113 stores in 2017. There is a real effort by Bed Bath & Beyond to become a one-stop shop for all home needs, and the brands carried contribute to this effort via either the retail or online presence in the sector.
 Historically, the company has shown strong fundamentals. It has grown sales every year for the last 25 years, while maintaining double-digit EBITDA margins. As the chart shows below, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) have been in the double digits for the past five years. 

 The company has been free cash flow (FCF)-positive since 1996, with a 2017 FCF margin of 5.5%. Over the last 5 years, it has returned $7 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. The 15 cent quarterly dividend translates to only a 1.7% yield, however the low payout (13%) means there is significant room for it to grow. Bed Bath & Beyond is rated BBB+ with debt due in 2024+. The Debt-to-EBITDA is 1x, and even if we including operating leases, this merely rises to 3x. From a risk standpoint, the Altman z-score is 5.8, the Piotroski score is 5 out of 9 and the Domash score is 7 out of 11. 

 The company's sales are 11% of the Furniture & Home Furnishing market. Its size is a serious advantage versus competitors, as it is able to aggressively negotiate with suppliers. Unfortunately, this segment has grown at a slower pace than New Home Sales. 


 The company has been growing sales at an even slower rate for the last three years despite its significant outperformance in previous years. For the past 10 years sales, operating profits and EPS have grown at 6%, 3% and 8% respectively. However, over the last 5 years, operating profits have dropped due to lower margins. 

 With the exception of Ethan Allen (NYSE:ETH), comparables have not been doing significantly better. Pier 1 (NYSE:PIR) and Wayfair (NYSE:W) margins are in decline, Restoration Hardware (NYSE:RH) is mixed but at a lower level, and only Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) is somewhat steady. If we look across retail, we see that department stores and apparel are in decline, while only home improvement is up. 

 On the positive side, same-store sales is not a concern with a very small fluctuation. 

 Another positive is the improvement in online sales. According to the SEC filings, "Comparable sales consummated through customer facing digital channels increased in excess of 20%". This is down from the "in excess of 50%" in 2014, however it is higher than U.S. eCommerce Retail Sales, which ranges around 14-16%.
 Product Pricing The bears argue that BBBY can't compete versus Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) pricing. Back in an October 2016 article, I showed that BBBY is cheaper than Amazon. In April, I put together a new basket of 70 items across all main product categories on the BBBY website. The items were selected in order of appearance, but clearance items were NOT included. I then searched and found the same items on the Amazon website and looked for the lowest price. Newly launched third-party Amazon sellers were excluded from the study. (These were only a few cases among the 70 items.) The pricing from April 14th, 2017, is shown below: 

 The average and median difference in price was 0%. 28 items were cheaper at BBBY, 9 items had the same price and 33 items were cheaper at AMZN. 11 days later, on April 25th, I used all the links to go check the same products again. This time, the average and median difference in prices were -1% and 0% respectively. 30 items were cheaper at BBBY, 10 items were equally priced and 30 items were cheaper on AMZN. Today, on June 6th, I did the same thing I did on April 25th. I went through the links and checked the prices. 3 items were no longer listed on Amazon, while 1 item was no longer available at BBBY. The table below shows the items along with the prices. If you would like a copy to check the items yourself, feel free to e-mail me. 

 The 4 filled red rows are the missing items. From the 66 items left, 30 were cheaper at BBBY, 9 were equally priced and 27 items were cheaper at AMZN. The average and median difference in price was -2% and 0% respectively. Note that this does not take into account any coupons.
 On a recent visit to the U.S., I went into a BBBY and spoke with the employees. They told me that typically people receive a 20% off one-item coupon, but a few times a year a coupon with 20% off all purchases is sent out. In addition, the new loyalty program, Beyond+, is being tested and by invitation allows 20% off all purchases always! If we take the 20% off all purchases into account, then the average and median difference in price drops to -22% and -20% respectively. Furthermore, 57 / 66 items are cheaper at BBBY! Now regarding variety and number of products, if you carry Free Range Chicken Poop lip balm, then in my book that counts as you carrying a lot of stuff. Do note that the company offers personalization on 5,000 items. 

 Furthermore, I would like to point out that the other brands (e.g., Christmas Tree Shops) carry additional items. Back in April, when I was browsing through the Christmas Tree Shops website, I noticed several sets of beer can glass cups like those shown below. At the time, Amazon was selling the same cups for $26. These can now be found for $17 on Amazon. What surprised me was that I could only find Corona cups on Amazon, while Christmas Tree Shops carried various beer brands. 

 Valuation What I like most about BBBY is how cheap it is. I put fair value of the company at $55-60. Below is the sensitivity analysis from my DCF on the terminal value and resulting share value.
 

 Historical multiples put the stock at $65 and industry multiples at $56-60. Current FCF-to-Enterprise Value is 11%, while analysts' projected FCF-to-EV is 10%. Conclusion The major risk is that margins continue to decline, but it appears that the rate of decline may have peaked in 3Q17, when the operating margin was 277 basis points (bps) lower year on year. The decline was -199 bps in 4Q17, and analysts expect -143 bps in 1Q18. Over the course of the year, this would translate into an 8%+ operating margin with the company valued at the very low EV/EBITDA of 4.4x. In comparison, the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) trades at 13x. The picture will be clearer over the course of the year. Fortunately for investors, this could be a case where a delayed entry will still pay off. Even if the stock jumps 15% from current levels, there is still a long way until $60. So, I highly recommend that you keep BBBY on your watch list. This 800-pound gorilla with sound fundamentals is not going away anytime soon.

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:BBBY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Bed Bath & Beyond Products Are Already Cheaper Than Amazon!Oct.31.16 | About: Bed Bath (BBBY) Sophocles Sophocleous CFA, value, long/short equityFatAlphaSummaryHistorically, Bed Bath & Beyond outpaced its category and has consistently grown sales and profits. Dropping margins have been the biggest issue in the last year.Stock is cheap. Market is pricing in a very dim future.Online sales are expanding at over 20% yoy. A random basket of 40 items was found to be cheaper than Amazon.com.Most Americans have heard of Bed Bath & Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) that sells a wide collection of domestic merchandise and home furnishings through over 1,000 of its namesake stores. What people may not know is that BBBY products are cheaper than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) before applying any coupons. With 20% coupons or its new membership program, it's not even close! Before we go into the research I did on product prices, let's look at some company fundamentals, comparables and valuation. Over the last 10 years, BBBY has grown revenues, operating profits and EPS by 8%, 5% and 10% respectively. 

 If we look at U.S. Retail Sales and specifically "Furniture and Home Furnishing stores," we see that BBBY has exhibited better growth than the category for every year except the last two. 

 The company has grown year after year, despite the competition, which has had its effect on margins (11.6% in FY16 vs. 16.5% in FY12). Street expectations are for another year of small growth but margins are expected to get even tighter. This trickles down to cash flow and while the company generated $0.8-1.1bn in free cash flow in FY12-15, this came in at $684m in FY16 with expectations of $600-700m for the next 2 years.
 Over the last four quarters, sales have been stable but operating profits have suffered with LTM operating margin 200 bps lower! 

 As a result, the stock price has declined and is at a new yearly low. The last time BBBY was at such prices it was 2010! Since 2010, operating profit and EPS are 43% and 119% higher respectively. 

(Source: StockCharts.com) Looking at the 5-year market multiples range the stock has traded at, we see it is below the low end (which would value it at $55). If the stock price were to return to its average or industry valuation, it would be trading at $60-70. 

 Compared to Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) and Restoration Hardware (NYSE:RH), BBBY comparable sales have been worse and have only beat Pier 1 (NYSE:PIR). It should be noted that all three of these companies are much smaller with last twelve-month sales of $5.1bn, $2.2bn and $1.8bn respectively. 


 Still, if we assume $650m in free cash flow in a zero growth perpetuity, the stock would be worth $54. We can only conclude that the market has priced in a pretty dim future for the company. Investors have raised concerns over online competition, but if we look at the company filings, we will find that online sales at BBBY are doing extremely well. In the last 9 quarterly filings, we find that online sales have been growing at 20-50% year on year. For example from the last 10-Q "...comparable sales consummated through customer facing online websites and mobile applications increased in excess of 20% over the corresponding periods in the prior year..." This language has been repeated quarter after quarter and only the number changes. The company never gives a precise figure but always says "in excess of." For your information, the year-on-year growth in online sales given in each of the last nine quarters are shown below. 

 These sales are not insignificant. As Kenra Investors pointed out, if we use simultaneous equations with the info we have, we can estimate that online sales are currently over $1bn! Furthermore, BBBY's e-commerce growth is actually ahead of U.S. E-Commerce Retail sales that has only grown 14-16% according to the U.S. Census Bureau (see data here). I decided to do some research on BBBY's online offerings. First, I browsed the online e-catalogs, which are currently the "October Circular," "Fall Book" and "Outdoor living." I started with the October Circular, and discovered the BBBY had decent prices. For examples, see below. 


 (Source: BBBY & AMZN websites) This got me curious and I started looking at items from the other 2 catalogs. Below are samples from the "Fall Book" and below that the "Outdoor Living" catalog. 

 (Source: BBBY & AMZN websites) 

(Source: BBBY & AMZN websites) Could it be that Bed Bath & Beyond offered consumers better prices versus Amazon? If I were to discover the answer, I would need to look at a lot more products. As we know from statistics, we need at least 30 observations; therefore, I went ahead and collected 40. I picked random products from random categories on the BBBY website and then I would search for them on Amazon. For the entire basket, BBBY was 6.5% cheaper than AMZN!!! On average, the list of items was 1% cheaper at BBBY (median cheapness was 2%). Shipping was not taken into consideration. All I did was look at the price of the items. If I had taken shipping into consideration, I suspect items would be even cheaper at BBBY because several items at amazon.com are sold by third parties with higher shipping rates. BBBY has free shipping on orders over $29 and I don't think that is hard to achieve. Another issue (not documented but noticed) is the delay in shipping. For example, "Wamsutta® 805 Turkish Cotton Bath Towel in White" has a price of $22.55 (vs. BBBY $19.99) with an additional $5.78 shipping charge and "Usually ships within 4 to 5 days." I do not live in the U.S. but it is my understanding that there are a lot of BBBY coupons circulating. If we take a 20% coupon into account then from our list of 40 products there are only 6 items, which are cheaper at amazon.com! Currently, BBBY is testing a paid subscription service (SA link, WSJ link). For $29 a year, a member gets 20% off all purchases and free shipping.
 That would put my basket of goods at a 25% discount to Amazon (median item 22%) or a $1167 savings vs. AMZN! In the WSJ article, it states that Wedbush analysts believe BBBY would be on average 13% cheaper than AMZN (after the 20% discount). My research disagrees. As my basket shows, the discount vs. AMZN already exists. I'll attach my excel with the basket to this article; however, it is my understanding only PRO subscribers are able to access attachments. If you are not a PRO subscriber, please contact me if you want a copy. Below is the list. 

 Management guidance for the year is $4.50 to just over $5.00 and this was kept the same in both the first two quarters. The Street estimates $4.74 and I agree based on the lower margins we have seen so far. BBBY with their recent marketing tests appear to be trying different things out. If they succeed and drive more people to their website and stores then margins will matter less. The company has been buying back stock but I believe they should also pay a much higher dividend. The higher dividend would attract investors seeking income and help support the stock. Current valuation levels are attractive and FCF generation may attract an activist. Investors are faced with a challenging investing opportunity, but as a value investor, I believe it is worth the risk.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER
LAURA TAYLOR SWAIN, District Judge.
Plaintiff Worldwide Home Products, Inc. ("Worldwide"), brought this suit against Defendants Bed, Bath and Beyond, Inc., and Cohesion Products Inc. ("Defendants"), for patent infringement, claiming that the "Real Simple Slimline Hanger" (the "Slimline Hanger") infringes upon U.S. Patent No. 7,938,300 (the "`300 Patent") and that former defendants Time, Inc. ("Time"), and Sherry Hanson ("Ms. Hanson") induced the infringement. Plaintiffs' claims against Time and Ms. Hanson were dismissed on December 21, 2012, for failure to state a claim. (See docket entry no. 147.) Defendants and Counterclaimants Bed Bath & Beyond, Inc. ("BBB") and Cohesion Products, Inc. ("Cohesion") (together, "Defendants") move for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 against Worldwide for filing claims against Time and Ms. Hanson.
The Court has thoroughly reviewed the submissions of the parties and, for the following reasons, the motion is denied.
BACKGROUND1
This motion arises from a patent infringement case brought by Worldwide concerning certain stackable hangers.
Ms. Hanson is a buying agent for household products for BBB. Time is a subsidiary of Time Warner, a company that owns over 90 magazines. Time also owns the trademark for the REAL SIMPLE brand of household products. Time licenses the use of that mark to Defendant BBB. In 2009, BBB arranged for suppliers of hangers to participate in an auction, and both Cohesion and Worldwide participated. Ms. Hanson thereafter attended a meeting with BBB employees and Worldwide employees to determine whether BBB would sell the Clutterfree Hanger owned by Worldwide. BBB agreed to sell the hanger on a trial basis to evaluate the product. BBB decided, after the trial period, to discontinue sale of the Clutterfree Hanger. BBB decided to purchase a hanger produced by Cohesion, and to sell it under Time's REAL SIMPLE trademark.
In February 2010, Worldwide wrote to inform Time and BBB of Worldwide's pending application for a patent on its hanger, U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 12/182,351 ("the `'351 application"). The claims in this action are premised on infringement of the resulting patent, U.S. Patent No. 7,938,300 (the "`300 patent"). The February 2010 letters indicated that Worldwide believed that the Cohesion hangers sold by BBB might infringe on the patent rights as to which Worldwide's application was pending. The `300 patent was issued on May 10, 2011.
On May 27, 2011, Worldwide filed a complaint alleging that each of the Defendants had infringed its rights under the `300 patent. Defendants perceived that Worldwide did not allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for direct infringement against either Time or Ms. Hanson. Defendants accordingly requested that Worldwide dismiss its claims against Time and Ms. Hanson. Plaintiff did not withdraw the claims against Time and Hanson. The Defendants filed an answer with affirmative defenses and counterclaims. Defendants again asked Worldwide to withdraw its claims against Time and Ms. Hanson, proffering case law that Defendants believed would control the matter. Worldwide did not respond to this request. Instead, Worldwide filed a motion to strike the affirmative defenses and counterclaims, which was denied by this Court on September 9, 2011. (Docket entry no. 24.)
In February 2012, Defendants sent Worldwide a letter notifying it of their intention to file a motion for sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(c)(2) against both Worldwide and its attorney for pursuing claims against Time and Ms. Hanson. (Docket entry no. 202, at Ex. 10.) Worldwide filed a motion to amend its complaint on February 17, 2012, asserting that it wished to limit its patent claims and to "plead additional facts to support its patent infringement claim against Time Inc. and Sherry Hanson," attaching its proposed amended complaint to the motion.2 (Docket entry no. 57.) The Court granted Worldwide's motion on April 20, 2012, and the amended complaint was deemed served on that date. (Docket entry no 83.) The amended complaint charged Time and Ms. Hanson with contributory infringement of its patent rights, rather than direct infringement.
Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint as against Time and Ms. Hanson, arguing that the complaint did not allege that Time or Ms. Hanson had engaged in any activity that exposed them to liability for patent infringement, focusing on the argument and authorities it had brought to Worldwide's attention in the prior correspondence and in Defendants' Rule 11 notice to Worldwide. (Compare docket entry no. 93 with docket entry no. 202, at Ex. 10.)
The Court rejected Worldwide's argument that the Complaint stated a claim against Ms. Hanson based on conduct before and after the issuance of the patent, finding Worldwide's factual allegations insufficient: "[t]he Complaint alleges that Hanson encouraged BB&B to purchase and sell the Slimline Hangers, a practice which began `shortly after [] June 1, 2009.' It does not allege that Hanson committed any acts of inducement after the patent's issuance, two years later in May 2011." (Docket entry no. 147 at Pg. 4.) Worldwide also argued that National Presto Industries v. West Bend Company, 76 F.3d 1185, 1196 (Fed. Cir. 1996)), which held that a plaintiff could not state a cause of action for inducing infringement of a patent based on acts before the patent was issued, had been abrogated legislatively by 35 U.S.C. § 154(d) ("Section 154(d)"). The Court disagreed, observing that there were no reported decisions postdating the enactment of Section 154(d) that supported the position that National Presto was no longer controlling and that the reported lower court decisions concerning the matter were to the contrary. (Docket entry no. 147 at pg. 4.)
Worldwide argued that Time had infringed the `300 Patent by failing to terminate its licensing agreement for REAL SIMPLE once it understood that the Cohesion hangers "fell within the scope of the `351 Application" and the patent. The Court held that Worldwide had not sufficiently pleaded facts demonstrating that Time had the culpable state of mind required to infringe the patent after its issuance. (Docket entry no. 147 at pg. 4.)
Defendants argue, based on the insufficiency of the factual allegations, that Worldwide violated Rule 11 by filing its initial complaint against Time and Ms. Hanson and by filing the amended complaint after Defendants had repeatedly pointed out the insufficiency of Worldwide's charges against those Defendants and served its Rule 11 notice. In light of what Defendants deem the facial implausibility of Worldwide's complaints and Worldwide's persistence in pressing its claims, Defendants urge the Court to infer that Worldwide's only motive in initiating and continuing the litigation as against Time and Ms. Hanson was to harass and continue its pressure on Time's co-defendants, Cohesion and BBB.
DISCUSSION
Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an attorney's presentation of a pleading or other submission to a court constitutes a certification:
that to the best of the person's knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances:
(1) it is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation;
(2) the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; [and]
(3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or . . . will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery [.]
Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b).
"Sanctions may be — but need not be — imposed when court filings are used for an `improper purpose,' or when claims are not supported by existing law, lack evidentiary support, or are otherwise frivolous." Ipcon Collections LLC v. Costco Wholesale Corp., 698 F.3d 58, 63 (2d Cir. 2012). The standard for sanctionable conduct is objective reasonableness, and therefore the court need not make a finding of bad faith. See In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir. 2003). The Supreme Court has instructed courts to read Rule 11 to "give effect to the Rule's central goal of deference" but cautiously "in light of concerns that it will . . . chill vigorous advocacy." Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 393 (1990); see also Katzman v. Victoria's Secret Catalogue, 167 F.R.D. 649, 659 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), aff'd, 113 F.3d 1229 (2d Cir. 1997) ("Sanctions must, however, be imposed carefully, lest they chill the creativity essential to the evolution of the law."). Courts therefore "resolve all doubts in favor of the party against whom sanctions are sought." Rodick v. City of Schenectady, 1 F.3d 1341, 1350 (2d Cir. 1993). In that vein, a court should sanction a party only where it is "patently clear that a claim has absolutely no chance of success." Abdelhamid v. Altria Grp., Inc., 515 F.Supp.2d 384, 392 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole-CNCA v. Valcorp, Inc., 28 F.3d 259, 264 (2d Cir. 1994)).
Although Worldwide raised claims in the amended complaint that ultimately failed as to Time and Ms. Hanson, the claims were not so lacking in factual or legal support as to render them clearly frivolous to a reasonable attorney. It is notable that Worldwide retreated from its direct infringement claims after receiving Defendants' correspondence and notices, advancing instead in defense of the re-framed Amended Complaint an indirect infringement argument based on a statutory amendment that permits the award of royalties for preinfringement conduct under certain circumstances. The argument was not clearly precluded by any controlling case law. The imposition of sanctions under circumstances such as these could tend to chill legitimate, creative advocacy. See Katzman, 167 F.R.D. at 659-61. Worldwide also proffered factual allegations as to Time's involvement in the infringement, that, while ultimately insufficient, were not so lacking in substance as to render them frivolous. (See docket entry no. 147 at pg. 4 (noting that, although Worldwide alleged it notified Time in February 2010 that the Slim Line Hanger fell within the scope of the patent application, it did not allege that Time was aware that the patent application had been granted).) Defendants' argument that Plaintiff misrepresented the purpose of its proposed complaint amendments is inconsistent with the record (see supra note 2) and thus provides no proper basis for sanctions.
Finally, although Plaintiff's claims against Time and Ms. Hanson were never more than thin and were properly dismissed, the Court finds insufficient support in the record for an inference that the claims were asserted solely for the improper purposes of harassing any of the Defendants or exerting settlement pressure on BBB and Cohesion. Accordingly, Defendants' motion for the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions is denied.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion for sanctions is denied.
This Order resolves docket entry no. 200.
SO ORDERED.


FootNotes 
1. The following material facts are drawn from Defendants' exhibits and are not disputed by Worldwide.

2. Defendants characterize Worldwide's claim limitation rationale as a cover for an undisclosed goal of amending the claims against Time and Ms. Hanson. Worldwide, however, clearly disclosed both goals in its motion papers. (See docket entry no. 57.)

UNION, N.J., Nov. 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. (NASDAQ:    BBBY) announced today that it has acquired PersonalizationMall.com (PMall.com), an industry-leading online retailer of personalized products based in Burr Ridge, Illinois, for approximately $190 million in cash, which reflects certain closing adjustments. 








Over the past 18 years, PMall.com has developed a fully-integrated, proprietary technology platform that drives quality, speed and efficiency throughout the process of personalizing a breadth of products to each customer's unique preference. PMall.com is a highly successful innovator of personalized products and currently offers an extensive assortment of products that can be customized through a variety of different personalization processes including sublimation, embroidery, digital printing, engraving, and sandblasting. PMall.com's vertically integrated e-commerce platform includes an automated personalization process and rapid order fulfillment, resulting in a differentiated customer experience.  
Bed Bath & Beyond remains focused on its mission to do more for and with its customers and to be viewed as the expert for the home, and to become the destination for customers' needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages; all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions the Company offers. The acquisition of PMall.com expands the Company's existing assortment in the growing product personalization category and brings a complementary portfolio of differentiated products that commemorate all of life's events and special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, holidays and the welcoming of a child. 
"We are delighted to welcome PersonalizationMall.com to Bed Bath & Beyond. They have built a tremendous business, and we are excited to support them as they advance their industry-leading position within the growing category of product personalization," stated Steven H. Temares, Chief Executive Officer and Member of the Board of Directors of Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. "As we have said previously, we view personalization as a significant opportunity for us to create additional differentiation and enable us to do more for and with our customers." Temares added, "We look forward to supporting PersonalizationMall.com as they continue to improve the customer experience by enhancing their product mix, upgrading their e-commerce website and driving optimization of their marketing initiatives. At the same time, we are excited by the opportunity to leverage their advanced personalization and production capabilities to create additional omnichannel offerings across all of our concepts."
"I am very proud of the work our team has done in building PersonalizationMall.com into a market segment leader due to the ever-increasing demand for a wide range of quality personalized gift offerings," said Dan Randolph, Founder and President, PersonalizationMall.com. "We are excited to be given the opportunity to realize the full potential of the PersonalizationMall.com brand in working together with Bed Bath & Beyond.  Additionally, it is a great opportunity for our PMall Team to become part of such an admired company that is as committed to great customer service as we are." 
Bed Bath & Beyond funded the transaction using cash on hand, and expects the acquisition to be slightly accretive to its net earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2016. The acquisition of PMall.com is not anticipated to have a material effect on Bed Bath & Beyond's fiscal 2016 third quarter ending on November 26, 2016. The Company's fiscal 2016 third quarter results are scheduled to be reported on December 21, 2016. 
Financial advisor to Bed Bath & Beyond on this transaction was Goldman, Sachs & Co. PersonalizationMall.com was advised by William Blair.
