FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price.

Frequently Asked Questions









      With such a long history as a private company, why did Jones Energy go public?
      




The reason for going public in 2013 was simple – the opportunity set for Jones had become too large to fund as a private company.
 
Jonny Jones, our Founder, Chairman, and CEO, started Jones Energy in 1988 with an investment of $3 million.  Jones had been a private company for over 25 years before going public in July 2013 at $15 per share, raising approximately $175 million. Just four months after going public, Jones announced one of the bigger acquisitions in its history, purchasing Sabine’s Anadarko assets for approximately $195 million.
 
We continue to see our opportunity for growth as vast and look forward to continuing our long tradition of operational excellence as a public company.






      Why does your market capitalization vary greatly depending upon what site I look at?
      




To properly calculate our market capitalization, one must include both the Class A and Class B shares outstanding. Some sites understate our market capitalization by only including the Class A shares.






      What brought Jones Energy to the Mid-Continent region?
      




Our founder, Jonny Jones, chose the Mid-Continent region back in 1988 because it was a great place to be in the oil and gas business, which still holds true today. The Mid-Continent region has long been a hospitable home to oil and gas companies with an impressive, nearly century-long history of drilling activity across multiple formations. This means that the region has significant midstream infrastructure and extensive well control - two factors that are extremely important to an upstream energy company.






      Why have you stayed focused in the Mid-Continent area?
      




This has been our home since the company’s inception and we have extensive experience that covers nearly 10 different formations. Additionally, the Mid-Continent continues to be an area of vast opportunity for Jones Energy. Just the Cleveland play alone covers over 2 million acres. The stacked pay potential of the Mid-Continent also provides significant development opportunities as Jones Energy is just beginning to tap the potential of other formations in the area.






      Are you willing to look at opportunities outside of the Mid-Continent?
      




We are constantly evaluating growth opportunities and do not limit ourselves to the Mid-Continent region. That said, we see tremendous opportunity in the Mid-Continent.  A key to our ability to maintain our growth and create value stems from scale in our core plays.  We seek opportunities where we can have a meaningful presence and this would apply to any potential new plays outside of our current focus areas. Most importantly, no matter where we grow, we will make sure that our growth is purposeful and deliberate – grounded in our strategy to only operate where we can be best in class.






      What is your hedging strategy?
      




We actively hedge our oil, gas and natural gas liquids production to minimize commodity price risk. We believe that if the economics are good enough to drill the well, then it is wise to lock in those economics and protect cash flow for future drilling, investment, and debt repayment. We primarily utilize swaps to hedge our production. In the near-term (12-24 months), we generally seek to maintain hedges for 100% of production from proved developing producing reserves and a reasonable amount of hedges for expected production from proved undeveloped reserves. Beyond 24 months, we generally seek to maintain hedges for 100% of our proved developed producing reserves, assuming adequate liquidity is available in the market. We think this strategy provides the Company with maximum operational optionality, and positions us to take advantage of opportunities regardless of the direction commodity prices move.

Corporate Governance


TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
We strive to promote a culture of accountability, fairness, and transparency – values that are at the heart of any successful organization. But, having these values is useless if a company does not have the appropriate rules, practices and processes in place to encourage the desired behaviors. Our management team and board of directors take corporate governance very seriously – they understand it can determine whether a company fails or succeeds.
