​​
Collin County opted to construct a "direct supervision" facility, which uses a podular design for inmate housing instead of a linear design, to create a secure and humane environment for both staff and inmates. The structure, in tandem with the direct supervision philosophy, promotes supervision of inmates rather than control by intermittent surveillance and security barriers alone. Recognizing that during the course of their careers detention employees will spend more time in the facility than will any incarcerated individual, the facility was designed to offer safe and normal working environment for the staff. This environment promotes positive morale, increases motivation, improves efficiency, and minimizes staff turnover.

Adjacent to the processing area are the property, bond, and release areas, which are accessible via the public corridor to allow persons to post bonds, pay fines, or retrieve personal property for incarcerated inmates. All inmate property and financial accounts are maintained and all release transactions are conducted in these areas. The effectiveness of the direct supervision management philosophy relies strongly on accurate classification of the inmates. The classification process examines the inmate's criminal history and observes and evaluates his or her physical, mental, and social conditions and behaviors to determine the most appropriate housing unit assignment for that person. Newly arriving inmates are temporarily placed in the classification housing unit until the evaluation is completed and the inmates are given a permanent housing assignment. While in the temporary unit, inmates are required to participate in an orientation program designed to familiarize them with the direct supervision philosophy, facility rules and regulations, services, and programs.

Sides, David William
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in North Carolina:













Does Sides David William carry a valid contracting license?



In North Carolina a construction project with costs of $30,000 or more requires a contractor to be licensed.
Sides David William currently holds license 32142 (Building), which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in North Carolina?



Contractors in North Carolina must take an exam administered by PSI licensure certification in order to become licensed. 











Your liability risk when hiring Sides David William



Although state law does not require contractors to carry general liability or workers' compensation insurance, hiring contractors who do have an active policy of each insurance is highly recommended. Request a copy of each insurance certificate for your records before any work begins.











Financial recourse when hiring Sides David William



Contractors in North Carolina do not have to obtain a surety bond to perform work on residential properties. Homeowners have financial recourse in North Carolina through The Homeowners Recovery Fund, which provides assistance to eligible North Carolina homeowners who have suffered a financial loss caused by the dishonest or incompetent conduct of a licensed general contractor.











What else should I know before hiring Sides David William



Licensed contractors must furnish proof of financial responsibility to obtain a limited, intermediate, or unlimited license according to a company's working capital. Working capital is current assets minus current liabilities.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in North Carolina, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
