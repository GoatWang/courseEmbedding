					Full Description



QIWI plc, incorporated on February 26, 2007, is a provider of payment services in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). The Company's network enables payment services across physical, online and mobile channels. The Company operates in target markets and customer segments. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had deployed over 17.2 million virtual wallets, over 162,000 kiosks and terminals, and enabled merchants to accept over Russian rubles 70 billion cash and electronic payments monthly. The Company's consumers can use cash, stored value and other electronic payment methods to order and pay for goods and services across physical or virtual environments interchangeably. The Company provides integrated network of physical distribution points and virtual wallets, as well as payment channels and methods that enable consumers to deposit cash, convert it into a digital form and transfer the funds to a virtual wallet or pay for any merchant in its network.Consumers access its payment network through two primary channels, including physical distribution represented by its kiosks and terminals, and virtual distribution represented by its online product that the Company operates under the Visa Qiwi Wallet (in Russia) and Qiwi Wallet (in Kazakhstan). As of December 31, 2016, its physical distribution comprised approximately of 113,000 kiosks and 49,000 terminals (including various interfaces at physical points of service) that were assembled and sold by third-party manufacturers. As of December 31, 2016, in addition to kiosks, the Company's network includes approximately 49,000 terminals at various retail locations, including a number of Russian retail chains, such as Svyaznoy and Euroset. As of December 31, 2016, its agent base included more than 6,400 agents who own kiosks and terminals and were responsible for placing, operating and servicing them in high-traffic, convenient retail locations.Visa Qiwi Wallet is an online and mobile payment processing and money transfer system that it offers in Russia that allows accountholders to pay for the products and services of merchants, and to perform peer-to-peer money transfers using a virtual wallet, which replaces a physical wallet in an online and mobile environment. A virtual wallet enables its holder to make online purchases through a secure and intuitive online or mobile interface with multiple payment methods. Visa Qiwi Wallet accounts can be linked to virtual or physical Visa prepaid cards that can be used to make purchases at any merchants that accept Visa worldwide. It operates Qiwi Wallet as a separate brand in certain jurisdictions outside of Russia. With Visa Qiwi Wallet, consumers can create an online account, referred to as a virtual wallet, in which they can store money, deposited from cash or funded from a range of other sources, such as mobile phone balances, bank accounts, credit or debit cards, or money transfers, that can be used to make payments, purchases, peer-to-peer transfers or to remit money. To register a virtual wallet, a consumer only needs to have a mobile phone number to which the account is linked. Visa Qiwi Wallet is available through a range of interfaces, including mobile applications, its own Website, touch-screens of its kiosks, merchant Websites, and SMS/USSD. Payments made through Visa Qiwi Wallet are categorized into push payments and pull payments. Visa Qiwi Wallet accounts can be reloaded through virtually any payment method available on the market, including making cash deposit at any of its kiosks or terminals or third party kiosks and terminals, bank cards and accounts, mobile phone balances, online banking and retail.The Company's Visa prepaid cards can be ordered through a Visa Qiwi Wallet and consists of various card products, including QIWI Visa Virtual or QIWI Visa Card-virtual prepaid cards linked to the balance of a consumer's Visa Qiwi Wallet that can be used to make purchases online from any merchant that accepts Visa-branded cards, and QIWI Visa Plastic Card-a physical card that can be used to make purchases online or in a physical retail environment through a POS terminal from any merchant that accepts Visa branded cards. Qiwi Visa Plastic Cards are also linked to the balance of a consumer's Visa Qiwi Wallet and can be used to withdraw cash from a participating ATM.As of December 31, 2016, it had approximately 13,000 merchants active on a monthly basis in its system. The Company's merchants are vendors, including mobile network operators, utilities, banks, money remittance companies and online retailers. Consumers can access its larger merchants through hyperlink icons placed directly on kiosk screens. Other merchants can be accessed through Visa Qiwi Wallet and, since any of its kiosks can be used as an interface to register a Visa Qiwi Wallet account or to access an existing one, the merchant offering is effectively the same for both kiosks and Visa Qiwi Wallet accounts. In addition, Visa Qiwi Wallet accounts can be linked to virtual or physical Visa prepaid cards that can be used to make purchases at any merchant that accept Visa around the world. Its merchants fall into five broad payment categories: E-commerce, Money Remittance, Financial Services, Telecom and Other.The Company competes with Sberbank, Alfa-Bank, Euroset, Svyaznoy, Russian Federal State Unitary Enterprise Postal Service, CyberPlat, Comepay, Elecsnet, WebMoney, Alibaba, PayPal and AliPay.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.              
              
            

5:22 p.m. July 27, 2017






Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

QIWI launches blockchain spinoff 
By East-West Digital News
 / March 3, 2017



Qiwi, a NASDAQ-listed Russian payment company, has created a subsidiary to develop blockchain products, the Russian business daily Kommersant reported earlier this week.
The new company, dubbed ‘Qiwi Blockchain Technologies’ (QBT), will be headed by Alexey Arkhipov, who currently serves as director of crypto-technology development at Qiwi.
This year, Qiwi may invest some 100 million rubles (nearly $1.7 million at the current exchange rate) in such technologies, Kommersant learned from an unnamed source with knowledge of the matter.
QBT will develop and implement blockchain technology for further integration into Qiwi’s operations. Thus a cryptoprocessing platform — using blockchain to process payments — has already been tested and will be applied to Qiwi’s new products.
In addition, QBT will provide external customers with expertise and consulting services, according to the company.
“[Our clients will be able to] integrate blockchain technology and start using it right away without even needing to understand how it actually works,” said Arkhipov.
For example, blockchain technologies may be used to create shareholder registers, store data, or use the Bank of Russia’s Masterchain, adds Arkhipov.
 
“Changing the economy, business and daily life”
A few months ago, the Russian media reported QIWI’s plans to track energy transactions using blockchain technology. The company partnered with Tavrida Electric, one of the world’s leading suppliers of circuit breakers and a global energy smart grid supplier. Under plans, each Tavrida Electric transaction is to be recorded on the blockchain. The transactions will be visible to regulatory agencies and other energy companies on the blockchain. Qiwi said it could extend the project to other energy companies.
Last year QIWI was among the initiators of a new consortium for joint exploration and project implementation in the field of blockchain and related technologies. The consortium presented itself as “Russia’s first collaboration platform across innovative and distributed technologies.”
“Over the past two years, the attention to blockchain and its derivatives has intensified. Blockchain can effectively solve the long-standing technological problems in the financial sector and change all kinds of relationships between market players,” Sergey Solonin, CEO of QIWI Group, said at that time.
Such innovative technologies “can lead the economy, business and daily life of a person to a completely new level of interaction and confidence,” he believes.
