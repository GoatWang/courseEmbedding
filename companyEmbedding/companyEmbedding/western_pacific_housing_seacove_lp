Second Supplemental Indenture dated
as of September 14, 2012 (“ Supplemental
Indenture ”), to the Indenture dated as of May 1,
2012 (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in
accordance therewith, the “ Base Indenture ”),
by and among D.R. Horton, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “
Company ”), each of the subsidiaries of the Company
that are signatories hereto as the initial guarantors (the “
Initial Guarantors ”) and American Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, as trustee (the “
Trustee ”).

Each party agrees as follows for the
benefit of the other party and for the equal and ratable benefit of
the Holders of Notes (each as defined herein):

WHEREAS, the Company and the Trustee
have duly authorized the execution and delivery of the Base
Indenture to provide for the issuance from time to time of senior
debt securities (the “Securities”) to be issued in one
or more Series as in the Base Indenture provided;

WHEREAS, the Company and the Initial
Guarantors desire and have requested the Trustee to join them in
the execution and delivery of this Supplemental Indenture in order
to establish and provide for the issuance by the Company of a
Series of Securities designated as its 4.375% Senior Notes due
2022, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A
(including any Additional Notes, as defined below, the “
Notes ”), initially guaranteed by the Initial
Guarantors, on the terms set forth herein;

WHEREAS, Section 2.01 of the
Base Indenture provides that a supplemental indenture may be
entered into by the Company, the Initial Guarantors and the Trustee
for such purpose provided certain conditions are met;

WHEREAS, the conditions set forth in
the Base Indenture for the execution and delivery of this
Supplemental Indenture have been complied with; and

WHEREAS, all things necessary to
make this Supplemental Indenture a valid agreement of the Company,
the Initial Guarantors and the Trustee, in accordance with its
terms, and a valid amendment of, and supplement to, the Base
Indenture have been done;

NOW, THEREFORE:

In consideration of the premises and
the purchase and acceptance of the Notes by the Holders thereof the
Company and the Initial Guarantors mutually covenant and agree with
the Trustee, for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders, that
the Base Indenture is supplemented and amended, to the extent
expressed herein, as follows:

ARTICLE ONE

Scope of Supplemental
Indenture

Section 1.01. General
.

The changes, modifications and
supplements to the Base Indenture effected by this Supplemental
Indenture shall be applicable only with respect to, and govern the
terms of, the Notes and shall not apply to any other Securities
that may have been or may hereafter be issued under the Base
Indenture unless a supplemental indenture with respect to such
other Securities specifically incorporates such changes,
modifications and supplements.



Pursuant to this Supplemental
Indenture, there is hereby created and designated the Notes as a
Series of Securities under the Base Indenture entitled
“4.375% Senior Notes due 2022.” The Notes shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto and will
mature and bear interest as provided in such form and have the
other terms and conditions set forth therein, this Supplemental
Indenture and the Base Indenture (to the extent not superseded
hereby). The Company shall pay interest on overdue principal at
4.375%; it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest
at 4.375%. The Notes shall be guaranteed by the Guarantors as
provided in the form of Exhibit B hereto. The Trustee will
initially be the Registrar and Paying Agent for the Notes, and DTC
will initially be the Depositary for the Notes. The covenants
provided in Article Three of this Supplemental Indenture are
applicable (unless waived or amended as provided in the Base
Indenture) so long as the Notes are outstanding or until defeasance
or other discharge pursuant to the Base Indenture. An aggregate
principal amount of $350.0 million of Notes will be issued on the
Issue Date. Additional Notes (the “ Additional Notes
”) in an unlimited amount may be issued in one or more
issuances from time to time on the same terms and conditions,
except for issue date, and if applicable, the issue price and the
first interest payment, either of which may differ from the
respective terms of the previously issued Notes of same Series, and
with the same CUSIP numbers as the Notes offered hereby without the
consent of Holders of the Notes. The Notes initially issued
hereunder and any such Additional Notes shall vote on all matters,

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Western Pacific Housing carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Western Pacific Housing



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Western Pacific Housing



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.











What else should I know before hiring Western Pacific Housing



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.









About BuildZoom






BuildZoom has one simple purpose: To help you find the perfect contractor
for any job, commercial or residential.
