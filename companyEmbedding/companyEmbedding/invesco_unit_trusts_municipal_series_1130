THE FUND

   This series of Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series (the "Fund") consists of
the underlying separate unit investment trust or trusts described above (the    
"Trust" or "Trusts"). Each Trust consists of a portfolio of interest-bearing    
obligations (the "Bonds" or "Securities") issued by or on behalf of             
municipalities and other governmental authorities, the interest on which is, in 
the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental authority,   
exempt from all federal income taxes under existing law. In addition, the       
interest income of each State Trust is, in the opinion of counsel, exempt to the
extent indicated from state and local taxes, when held by residents of the state
where the issuers of Bonds in such Trust are located. Each Insured Trust holds  
bonds each insured through policies obtained from bond insurance companies.     

PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE 

 The Public Offering Price of the Units of each Trust includes the aggregate
bid price of the Securities in such Trust, an applicable sales charge, cash, if 
any, in the Principal Account held or owned by such Trust, and accrued interest,
if any. See "Summary of Essential Financial Information".                       

ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 

Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns to Unitholders are indicated under
"Summary of Essential Financial Information". The methods of calculating        
Estimated Current Returns and Estimated Long-Term Return are set forth in Part  
II of this Prospectus.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Unitholders of Invesco Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 1133:         

We have audited the accompanying statement of condition (including the    
analysis of net assets and the related portfolio schedule) of Investors' Quality
Tax-Exempt Trust, Series 176 (the "Trust," included in Invesco Unit Trusts,     
Municipal Series 1133) as of January 31, 2016, and the related statements of    
operations and changes in net assets for the period from February 5, 2013 (date 
of deposit) through January 31, 2014 and for each of the two years in the period
ended January 31, 2016, and the financial highlights for the period from        
February 5, 2013 (date of deposit) through January 31, 2014 and for each of the 
two years in the period ended January 31, 2016. These financial statements and  
financial highlights are the responsibility of management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights    
based on our audits.                                                            

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public    
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement.
We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal control over    
financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over 
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are          
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an      
opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial     
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and          
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall     
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of       
securities owned at January 31, 2016 by correspondence with The Bank of New York
Mellon, Trustee. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our  
opinion.                                                                        

   In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of       
Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt Trust, Series 176 (included in Invesco Unit       
Trusts, Municipal Series 1133) as of January 31, 2016, and the results of its   
operations and changes in net assets for the period from February 5, 2013 (date 
of deposit) through January 31, 2014 and for each of the two years in the period
ended January 31, 2016, and the financial highlights for the period from        
February 5, 2013 (date of deposit) through January 31, 2014 and for each of the 
two years in the period ended January 31, 2016, in conformity with accounting   
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.                  

                                                          /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                             

  Security Valuation - Tax-exempt municipal securities are stated at the value
determined by the Evaluator, a third party valuation provider. The Evaluator may
determine the value of the Bonds (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the  
Bonds obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in Bonds comparable 
to those held by the Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices for comparable Bonds,
(3) by determining the value of the Bonds by appraisal or (4) by any combination
of the above.                                                                   

   Security Cost - The original cost to the Trust (Investors' Quality Tax-Exempt
Trust, Series 176) was based on the determination by the Evaluator of the       
offering prices of the Bonds on the date of deposit (February 5, 2013). Since   
the valuation is based upon the bid prices, the Trust (Investors' Quality       
Tax-Exempt Trust, Series 176) recognized a downward adjustment of $72,979 on the
date of deposit resulting from the difference between the bid and offering      
prices. This downward adjustment was included in the aggregate amount of        
unrealized depreciation reported in the financial statements for the Trust for  
the period ended January 31, 2014.                                              

  Unit Valuation - The redemption price per Unit is the pro rata share of each
Unit in each Trust based upon (1) the cash on hand in such Trust or monies in   
the process of being collected, (2) the Bonds in such Trust based on the value  
determined by the Evaluator and (3) interest accrued thereon, less accrued      
expenses of the Trust, if any.                                                  

  Federal Income Taxes - For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to August 2,
2006, such Trust has been structured to be treated as a grantor trust for       
federal income tax purposes. Thus, such a Trust will not be treated as a taxable
entity for federal income tax purposes, and each Unitholder will be considered  
to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of such Trust. Accordingly, 
no provision has been made for federal income taxes. For a Trust with a Date of 
Deposit on or after August 2, 2006, each such Trust has elected and intends to  
qualify on a continuous basis for special income tax treatment as a "regulated  
investment company" ("RIC") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
If such Trust so qualifies, as expected, it will not be subject to federal      
income tax on amounts distributed to Unitholders. Your Trust's Date of Deposit  
is listed above in the section entitled "Summary of Essential Financial         
Information". For a discussion of the federal tax status of income earned on    
Units, see "Federal Tax Status--Grantor Trusts" or "Federal Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies", as applicable, in Part II of this      
Prospectus.                                                                     

For each calendar year-end, a RIC trust files an annual tax return, Form  
1120-RIC, with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). These returns are subject  
to IRS examination under a three-year statute of limitations. To date, the Trust
has no IRS examination pending.                                                 

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - FASB Accounting Standards    
Codification ("ASC"), clarifies the appropriate method of accounting for        
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements  
and provides related guidance. There is no material effect on the net asset     
value, financial condition or results of operations of the Trust.               

Subsequent Events - Events or transactions that have occurred from the    
balance sheet date through the date of issuance are evaluated by the Sponsor.   

Other - The financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of    
accounting. Any realized gains or losses from securities transactions are       
reported on an identified cost basis.                                           

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO                                                              

   Ratings - The source of all ratings, exclusive of those designated NR or * is
Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies ("S&P"). Ratings     
marked * are by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") as these Bonds are  
not rated by S&P. NR indicates that the Bond is not rated by S&P or Moody's. The
ratings shown represent the latest published ratings of the Bonds. For a brief  
description of rating symbols and their related meanings, see "Description of   
Securities Ratings" in the Information Supplement.                              

   Redemption Feature - There is shown under this heading the year in which each
issue of Bonds is initially or currently callable and the call price for that   
year. Each issue of Bonds continues to be callable at declining prices          
thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue discount Bonds   
which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of      
original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some   
premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. "S.F." indicates 
a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of Bonds. "P.R."         
indicates a bond has been prerefunded. Redemption pursuant to call provisions   
generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at
times when the redeemed Bonds have an offering side evaluation which represents 
a premium over par. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in the Trust at 
a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a 
loss of capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the    
Units. Conversely, to the extent that the Bonds were acquired at a price lower  
than the redemption price, this will represent an increase in capital when      
compared with the original Public Offering Price of the Units. Distributions    
will generally be reduced by the amount of the income which would otherwise have
been paid with respect to redeemed Bonds and there will be distributed to       
Unitholders the principal amount in excess of $1 per Unit semi-annually for     
Trusts with a Date of Deposit prior to April 21, 2009, or in excess of $5 per   
Unit monthly for Trusts with a Date of Deposit on or after April 21, 2009, and  
any premium received on such redemption. However, should the amount available   
for distribution in the Principal Account exceed $10.00 per Unit for Trusts with
a Deposit Date prior to April 21, 2009, the Trustee will make a special         
distribution from the Principal Account on the next succeeding monthly          
distribution date to holders of record on the related monthly record date. The  
Estimated Current Return in this event may be affected by such redemptions. For 
the federal tax effect on Unitholders of such redemptions and resultant         
distributions, see "Federal Tax Status" in Part II of this Prospectus.

NOTE 2 - PORTFOLIO (continued)                                                  

   Certain Bonds may have a "make whole" call option and are redeemable in whole
or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that is
generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of such Bonds, a "make whole"
amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The "make
whole" amount is generally equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate    
present value as of the date of redemption of principal being redeemed and the  
amount of interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption)    
that would have been payable if redemption had not been made, determined by     
discounting the remaining principal and interest at a specified rate (which     
varies from bond to bond and is generally equal to an average of yields on      
municipal obligations with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the
bond plus a premium rate) from the dates on which the principal and interest    
would have been payable if the redemption had not been made, over (ii) the      
aggregate principal amount of the bonds being redeemed.                         

 Insurance - Insurance coverage providing for the timely payment when due of
all principal and interest on certain of the Bonds in the Trust may have been   
obtained by the Trust or by one of the Preinsured Bond Insurers (as indicated in
the Bond name), however, certain other Bonds may not be insured. Such insurance 
does not guarantee the market value of the Bonds or the value of the Units. For 
Bonds covered under the Trust's insurance policy the insurance is effective only
while Bonds thus insured are held in the Trust and the insurance premium, which 
is a Trust obligation, is paid on a monthly basis. The premium for insurance    
which has been obtained from various insurance companies by the issuer of the   
Bond involved is payable by the issuer.                                         

  ASC states that, for financial reporting purposes, insurance coverage of the
type acquired by the Trust does not have any measurable fair value in the       
absence of default of the underlying Bonds or of indications of the probability 
of such default.                                                                

  Fair Value Measurements - As described in Note 1, the Trust utilizes various
methods to measure the fair value of its investments. ASC establishes both a    
framework for measuring fair value as well as a hierarchy that prioritizes      
inputs to valuation methods. The various inputs that may be used to determine   
the value of the Trust's investments are summarized in the three levels         
presented below. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not
necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those        
securities.                                                                     

Level 1 -- Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.      

Level 2 -- Prices determined using other significant observable inputs.   
Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing
a security, which may include quoted prices for similar securities, interest    
rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk.                                       

Level 3 -- Prices determined using significant unobservable inputs. In    
certain situations where quoted prices or observable inputs are unavailable,    
unobservable inputs may be used. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trust's own    
assumptions about the factors market participants would use in pricing an       
investment, and would be based on the best information available.               

   The following table summarizes the Trust's investments as of January 31, 2016
based on the inputs used to value them:

Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation - An analysis of net unrealized  
appreciation (depreciation) at January 31, 2016 is as follows:                  

Unrealized Appreciation                             $      47,450

NOTE 3 - OTHER                                                                  

Marketability - Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor may    
maintain a market for Units and continuously offer to purchase Units at prices, 
subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid price of the Bonds  
in the portfolio of the Trust, plus interest accrued to the date of settlement. 
If the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for other business reasons, the       
Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. In the event that a  
market is not maintained for the Units, a Unitholder desiring to dispose of his 
Units may be able to do so only by tendering such Units to the Trustee for      
redemption at the redemption price.

NOTE 3 - OTHER (continued)                                                      

Cost to Investors - The cost to original investors was based on the       
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate offering price of the Bonds per Unit 
on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a sales charge of 4.9% of the       
public offering price which was equivalent to 5.152% of the aggregate offering  
price of the Bonds. The secondary market cost to investors is based on the      
Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of the Bonds per Unit on   
the date of an investor's purchase plus a sales charge based upon the years to  
average maturity of the Bonds in the portfolio. The sales charge ranges from    
1.50% of the public offering price (1.523% of the aggregate bid price of the    
Bonds) for a Trust with a portfolio with less than two years to average         
maturity to 4.80% of the public offering price (5.042% of the aggregate bid     
price of the Bonds) for a Trust with a portfolio with fifteen or more years to  
average maturity.                                                               

  Compensation of Evaluator and Supervisor - The Supervisor receives a fee for
providing portfolio supervisory services for the Trust ($.25 per Unit, not to   
exceed the aggregate cost of the Supervisor for providing such services to the  
Trust). In addition, the Evaluator receives an annual fee for regularly         
evaluating each of the Trust's portfolios. Both fees may be adjusted for        
increases under the category "Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer    
Price Index for All Urban Consumers.                                            

NOTE 4 - REDEMPTION OF UNITS                                                    

During the period from February 5, 2013 (date of deposit) through January
31, 2014 and for each of the two years in the period ended January 31, 2016,    
275 Units, 6 Units and 60 Units, respectively, were presented for redemption.

Series, Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series or Invesco Unit Trusts,        
Municipal Series (the "Fund"). The Fund was created under the laws of the State 
of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust             
Agreement"), dated the Date of Deposit among Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. as   
Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Invesco  
Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as     
Trustee, or their predecessors.                                                 

The Fund consists of separate portfolios of interest-bearing obligations  
issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the United States, and      
political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in    
the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities, excludable   
from gross income for Federal income tax purposes under existing law. All       
issuers of bonds in a State Trust are located in the state for which the Trust  
is named or in United States territories or possessions and their public        
authorities; consequently, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the     
issuing authorities, the interest earned on the bonds is exempt from state and  
local taxes to the extent indicated herein and to the extent permitted under    
local law. Further, in the opinion of bond counsel to the respective issuers    
rendered at closing, the interest income of each bond in a U.S. Territorial     
IM-IT Trust is exempt from state, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and local income  
taxation. Interest on certain bonds in a National Quality AMT Trust may be a    
preference item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. Accordingly, a     
National Quality AMT Trust may be appropriate only for investors who are not    
subject to the alternative minimum tax. Trusts that hold only insured bonds are 
referred to herein as "Insured Trusts". "Long-Term Trust" refers to IM-IT,      
Investment Grade Municipal, U.S. Territorial IM-IT, High Grade Tax-Exempt Bond, 
20+ Year Series, Long-Term State and National Quality Trusts. "Investment Grade 
Municipal Intermediate Trust" refers to an Investment Grade Municipal Trust     
which is designated as an "intermediate series" or "7-13 Year Series" in the    
name of such Trust. "Intermediate-Term Trust" refers to Strategic Municipal     
Trust Intermediate Series, State Intermediate Trusts, Investment Grade          
Municipal Intermediate Trusts and State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts.  
Trusts that are named for a particular state are referred to herein as "State   
Trusts". "State Intermediate Trust" refers to a State Trust which is designated 
as an "intermediate series" in the name of such Trust. "State Intermediate      
Laddered Maturity Trust" refers to a State Trust which is designated as an      
"intermediate laddered maturity series" in the name of such Trust. State        
Trusts, other than State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trusts or State         
Intermediate Trusts, are referred to herein as "Long-Term State Trusts".        
"Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trust" refers to an Investment     
Grade Municipal Trust which is designated as a "limited maturity series" in the 
name of such Trust. "10-20 Year Trust" refers to a trust which is designated as 
a "10-20 year series" in the name of such trust.                                

On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited the bonds with the Trustee. 
The bonds initially consisted of delivery statements relating to contracts for  
their purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit  
issued by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the 
bonds, delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the Units.             

 The following table sets forth the approximate range of maturities in years
from the Date of Deposit for bonds held in the indicated Trusts:

The portfolio of any IM-IT Laddered Series is structured so that          
approximately 20% of the bonds will mature every five years, beginning in       
approximately the tenth year of the Trust, entitling each Unitholder to return  
of principal. The portfolio of any State Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust is
structured so that approximately 20% of the bonds will mature each year,        
beginning in approximately the fifth year of the Trust, entitling each          
Unitholder to a return of principal. This return of principal may offer         
Unitholders the opportunity to respond to changing economic conditions and to   
specific financial needs that may arise during the periods of scheduled         
maturities. However, the flexibility provided by the return of principal may    
also eliminate a Unitholder's ability to reinvest at a rate as high as the yield
on the bonds which matured.                                                     

Each Unit represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and 
net income of a Trust. To the extent that any Units are redeemed to the         
Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in a Trust represented by each Unit  
will increase, although the actual interest in the Trust will remain unchanged. 
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until the        
termination of the Trust Agreement.                                             

Objectives and Bond Selection. The Trusts seek to preserve capital and to 
provide federal tax-exempt income and, in the case of most State Trusts,        
Federal and state tax-exempt income. The Trusts invest in portfolios of         
municipal bonds issued by or on behalf of states and territories of the United  
States, and political subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on     
which is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing authorities, 
excludable from gross income for federal and, for State Trusts, state and, if   
applicable, local personal income tax purposes under existing law. An IM-IT     
Laddered Series has additional objectives of providing protection against       
changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through an investment in a 
laddered portfolio of interest-bearing obligations with maturities ranging from 
approximately 10 to 30 years in which roughly 20% of the bonds mature every     
five years beginning in approximately the tenth year of the Trust. A State      
Intermediate Laddered Maturity Trust has additional objectives of providing     
protection against changes in interest rates and investment flexibility through 
an investment in a laddered portfolio of intermediate-term interest-bearing     
obligations with maturities ranging from approximately 5 to 10 years in which   
roughly 20% of the bonds mature each year beginning in approximately the fifth  
year of the Trust. There is, of course, no guarantee that the Trusts will       
achieve their objectives. A Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for  
investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of tax-exempt fixed income   
bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire           
individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets will not eliminate the risk   
of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds. Insurance guaranteeing the   
timely payment, when due, of all principal and interest on the bonds in each    
Insured Trust has been obtained from municipal bond insurance companies. See    
"Insurance on the Bonds". In addition, these bonds are often not available in   
small amounts.                                                                  

In selecting bonds for the Trusts, the Sponsor considered the following   
factors, among others: the ratings criteria applicable to your Trust as listed  
under "Principal Investment Strategy", (b) the prices of the bonds relative to  
other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided 
by the bonds, (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and       
location of issuer and (e) the probability of early return of principal or high 
legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or 
its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. 
Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered 
in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to    
dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration"). In  
particular, the ratings of the bonds in any Investment Grade Municipal Trust    
could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") during the   
Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. See "The
Trusts--Risk Factors".                                                          

The Bonds. Your Trust invests in municipal bonds. States, municipalities and
public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes.  
In selecting bonds, we seek to diversify your portfolio by type of bond         
purpose. This section briefly describes different bond types to help you better 
understand your investment. The types of bonds a percentages they represent in  
your portfolio as listed under "Summary of Essential Financial Information".    
These bonds are described in greater detail in the Information Supplement. See  
"Additional Information".                                                       

General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the    
issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and        
unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest.               

Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or  
authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes.  
The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income 
of the related project falters because that income is the only source of        
payment. All of the following bonds are revenue bonds.                          

 Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The
ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the  
ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to      
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors,    
some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations.                    

 Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger
offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types 
of financing projects that these obligations support vary.                      

Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease     
obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these    
bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting               
appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate      
future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments   
typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their   
budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient 
funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds.                

Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from     
hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments   
on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for       
services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the     
need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and 
claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).    

 Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities
and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants   
and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number   
of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees,      
uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and        
government legislation or regulation.                                           

Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or       
improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these       
projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on  
factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project,  
revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or 
other regulatory restrictions.                                                  

Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or        
housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally 
pre-payable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their   
stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends 
on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses,         
mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of      
subsidies.                                                                      

Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from  
mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These 
bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general    
risks.                                                                          

Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or 
improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention   
centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The    
ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such  
as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments 
on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use  
of the facility.                                                                

Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and
secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds 
depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems     
related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education    
financing.                                                                      

Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive
revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these   
issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates    
and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate     
approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels.                             

 Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues
from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences       
generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to      
multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks.         

 Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a
municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These    
bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, 
however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay     
these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to  
pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a 
municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability 
to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds.                   

 Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public
transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation   
systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends   
on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from  
other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive      
revenues primarily from fees imposed on ships using the port facilities. These  
fees can fluctuate depending on the local economy and competition from air,     
rail and truck transportation. Increased fuel costs, alternative transportation 
modes and competition from toll-free bridges and roads will impact revenues of  
issuers that operate bridges, roads or tunnels.                                 

Waste disposal bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from 
resource recovery facilities. These facilities process solid waste, generate    
steam and convert steam to electricity. These issuers face problems such as     
costs and delays due to environmental concerns, effects of conservation and     
recycling, destruction or condemnation of a project, void or unenforceable      
contracts, changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating     
supplies or facilities, and other unavoidable changes that adversely affect     
operation of a project.                                                         

Water and sewer bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from
user fees from the sale of water and sewerage services. These issuers face      
problems such as the ability to obtain rate increases, population declines,     
difficulties in obtaining new fresh water supplies and "no-growth" zoning       
ordinances. These issuers also face many of the same problems of waste disposal 
issuers.                                                                        

Wholesale electric bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues  
from selling electricity to other utilities. The ability of these issuers to    
make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand    
for electric utilities, competition, overhead expenses and government           
regulation and rate approvals.                                                  

More About the Bonds. In addition to describing the purpose of the bonds, 
other information about the bonds is also listed in the "Portfolio" in          
Prospectus Part I. This information relates to other characteristics of the     
bonds. This section briefly describes some of these characteristics.            

Original issue discount bonds were initially issued at a price below their
face (or par) value. These bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than       
comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value. In a stable      
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to increase    
more slowly in early years and in greater increments as the bonds approach      
maturity. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond       
before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.  

  Zero coupon bonds are a type of original issue discount bond. These bonds do
not pay any current interest during their life. If an investor owns this type   
of bond, the investor has the right to receive a final payment of the bond's    
par value at maturity. The price of these bonds often fluctuates greatly during 
periods of changing market interest rates compared to bonds that make current   
interest payments. The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a   
bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par    
value.                                                                          

Municipal Bond Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section   
describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You  
should understand these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds      
falls, the value of your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing  
in a Trust. No one can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or  
that your investment return will be positive over any period. The Information   
Supplement contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your         
investment.                                                                     

Current economic conditions. The economic recession in the United States  
which began in 2007 technically came to an end in June of 2009, however the     
U.S. and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary     
period, including increased unemployment and below-average levels of economic   
activity. The U.S. and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps 
to combat the effects of the economic crisis, however the ultimate impact of    
these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted. In December of 2013, the     
U.S. Federal Reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing  
program, however, there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future 
changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest      
rates over the previous five years. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Rating 
Services downgraded the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States  
of America to AA+ from AAA, citing the prolonged controversy over raising the   
statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate. Any substantial    
change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant        
valuation increases or declines in your Trust's holdings.                       

Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will    
fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original 
purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to   
various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the    
financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or 
insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your       
portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust   
will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a  
managed fund.                                                                   

  Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest
rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise 
in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are
often more sensitive to interest rate changes. Given the historically low       
interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are   
heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest    
rate increases could be swift and significant.                                  

   Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond.                            

Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its
stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond
pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original 
purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to 
you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to  
reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less   
than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par   
value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your 
units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate     
early. The first date that the issuer can call each bond in the portfolio is    
listed in Prospectus Part I along with the price the issuer would have to pay.  
Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or       
mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax   
laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the    
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other events.
The call provisions are described in general terms in the "Redemption Feature"  
column of the "Portfolio" section in Prospectus Part I, and the notes thereto.  
Additional discussion of call provisions appears in the Information Supplement. 

Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating  
agency decreases the bond's rating.                                             

Bond concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified   
because it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of    
bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be             
"concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are described under  
"The Bonds".                                                                    

  Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller
and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could        
increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses.           

 Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in
the bond is limited or absent. The market for certain investments may become    
less liquid or illiquid due to adverse changes in the conditions of a particular
issuer or due to adverse market or economic conditions. In the absence of a     
liquid trading market for a particular security, the price at which such        
security may be sold to meet redemptions, as well as the value of the Units of  
your Trust, may be adversely affected. No one can guarantee that a liquid       
trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in   
the over-the-counter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange).     

 Insurer Default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could
lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond  
both default in making their payment obligations.                               

Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or     
legislation could affect the value of your Trust. For example, future           
legislation could reduce tax rates, impose a flat tax, exempt all investment    
income from tax or change the tax status of the bonds. Litigation could         
challenge an issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds.             

 No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Trust is not a deposit of any bank
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   
or any other government agency.                                                 

ESTIMATED CURRENT AND LONG-TERM RETURNS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Estimated Current Return and the Estimated Long-Term Return are set   
forth in the Prospectus Part I. Estimated Current Return is calculated by       
dividing the estimated net annual interest income per Unit by the Public        
Offering Price. The estimated net annual interest income per Unit will vary     
with changes in fees and expenses of the Trust and with the principal           
prepayment, default (if any), redemption, maturity, exchange or sale of bonds.  
The Public Offering Price will vary with changes in the price of the bonds.     
Accordingly, there is no assurance that the present Estimated Current Return    
will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using  
a formula which (1) takes into consideration, and determines and factors in the 
relative weightings of, the market values, yields (which takes into account the 
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of the bonds and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales      
charge associated with Units. Since the value and estimated retirements of the  
bonds and the expenses of a Trust will change, there is no assurance that the   
present Estimated Long-Term Return will be realized in the future. The          
Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are expected to differ  
because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated    
dates and amounts of principal returned on the bonds while the Estimated        
Current Return calculation includes only net annual interest income and Public  
Offering Price.                                                                 

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price. The secondary    
market Public Offering Price is based on the bid prices of the bonds, the sales 
charge described below, cash, if any, in the Principal Account and accrued      
interest, if any. The actual sales charge that may be paid by an investor may   
differ slightly from the sales charges due to rounding that occurs in the       
calculation of the Public Offering Price and in the number of Units purchased.  
The minimum purchase is one Unit. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may   
charge an order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.                     

The maximum secondary market sales charge is computed as described in the 
following table based upon the estimated long-term return life in years (ELTR   
Life) of a Trust's portfolio:                                                   

ELTR Life (Years)              Sales Charge                                     
-------------------------------------------                                     
Less than 2 .................      1.50%                                        
2 but less than 4 ...........      2.00                                         
4 but less than 6 ...........      3.00                                         
6 but less than 8 ...........      3.50                                         
8 but less than 11 ..........      4.00                                         
11 but less than 15 .........      4.50                                         
15 and over .................      4.80                                         

The ELTR Life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's     
portfolio as determined for purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return. 
See "Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns". The sales charges in the above   
table are expressed as a percentage of the secondary market Public Offering     
Price per Unit. For example, the maximum secondary market sales charge for a    
Trust with an ELTR Life of "6 but less than 8" years would be 3.50% of the      
Public Offering Price per Unit (3.630% of the aggregate bid price of the        
bonds).                                                                         

Reducing Your Sales Charge. Employees, officers and directors (including  
their spouses (or the equivalent if recognized under local law) and children or 
step-children under 21 living in the same household, parents or step-parents    
and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of     
Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. and its affiliates and dealers and their          
affiliates may purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the applicable  
dealer concession. All employee discounts are subject to the policies of the    
related selling firm. Only employees, officers and directors of companies that  
allow their employees to participate in this employee discount program are      
eligible for the discounts.                                                     

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I  
in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the bonds. The "Evaluation     
Time" is the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that   
the Exchange is open for regular trading or earlier on days where the Bond      
Market Association recommends an early bond market close. Orders received by    
the Trustee or Sponsor for purchases, sales or redemptions after that time, or  
on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is closed, will be held until the     
next determination of price. The secondary market Public Offering Price per     
Unit will be equal to the aggregate bid price of the bonds plus the applicable  
secondary market sales charge and dividing the sum by the number of Units       
outstanding. For secondary market purposes, this computation will be made by    
the Evaluator as of the Evaluation Time for each day on which any Unit is       
tendered for redemption and as necessary. The offering price of bonds may be    
expected to range approximately from 0.125% to 1.375% more than the bid price.  

The aggregate price of the bonds is determined on the basis of bid prices 
(a) on the basis of current market prices obtained from dealers or brokers who  
customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the Fund; (b) if these    
prices are not available, on the basis of current market prices for comparable  
bonds; (c) by causing the value of the bonds to be determined by others engaged 
in the practice of evaluation, quoting or appraising comparable bonds; or (d)   
by any combination of the above. Market prices of the bonds will generally      
fluctuate with changes in market interest rates.                                

A person will become the owner of Units on the date of settlement provided
payment has been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to 
the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the Sponsor's   
business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to the       
limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                             

 Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is an accumulation of unpaid interest on
securities which generally is paid by the bonds semi-annually, although each    
Trust accrues interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an amount of  
interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this reason, with     
respect to purchases of Units in the secondary market, the proportionate share  
of accrued interest to the settlement date is added to the Public Offering      
Price of Units. You will receive the amount of accrued interest paid on your    
Units on the next distribution date. Because of the varying interest payment    
dates of the bonds, accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than  
the amount of interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to          
Unitholders. If you sell or redeem all or a portion of your Units, you will be  
entitled to receive your proportionate share of the accrued interest from the   
purchaser of your Units.                                                        

  Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by broker-dealers
and others at the Public Offering Price, plus accrued interest. The Sponsor     
intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. Broker-dealers or      
others will be allowed a concession or agency commission in connection with the 
distribution of Units equal to 80% of the sales charge applicable to the        
transaction provided that the Units are acquired from the Sponsor. Certain      
commercial banks may be making Units available to their customers on an agency  
basis. A portion of the sales charge paid by these customers (equal to the      
agency commission referred to above) is retained by or remitted to the banks.   
Any discount provided to investors will be borne by the selling dealer or agent.
The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order for the
purchase of Units and to change the amount of the concession or agency          
commission to dealers and others up to the entire amount of the sales charge.   

Sponsor Compensation. The Sponsor will receive a gross sales commission   
equal to the sales charge applicable to the transaction involved. See "Public
Offering--General". In addition, the Sponsor realized a profit or loss, as a    
result of the difference between the price paid for the bonds by the Sponsor    
and the cost of the bonds to a Trust. The Sponsor has not participated as sole  
underwriter or as manager or as a member of the underwriting syndicates from    
which the bonds in the Trusts were acquired. The Sponsor may further realize    
profit or loss as a result of possible fluctuations in the market value of the  
bonds since all proceeds received from purchasers of Units (excluding dealer    
concessions or agency commissions allowed, if any) will be retained by the      
Sponsor. The Sponsor will also realize profits or losses in the amount of any   
difference between the price at which Units are purchased and the price at      
which Units are resold in connection with maintaining a secondary market for    
Units and will also realize profits or losses resulting from a redemption of    
repurchased Units at a price above or below the purchase price.                 

Broker-dealers of the Trusts, banks and/or others are eligible to         
participate in a program in which such firms receive from the Sponsor a nominal 
award for each of their representatives who have sold a minimum number of units 
of unit investment trusts created by the Sponsor during a specified time        
period. In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs  
under which the sales forces of such firms may be eligible to win other nominal 
awards for certain sales efforts, or under which the Sponsor will reallow to    
any such firms that sponsor sales contests or recognition programs conforming   
to criteria established by the Sponsor, or participate in sales programs        
sponsored by the Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales    
charges on the sales generated by such persons at the public offering price     
during such programs. Also, the Sponsor in its discretion may from time to time 
pursuant to objective criteria established by the Sponsor pay fees to           
qualifying firms for certain services or activities which are primarily         
intended to result in sales of Units of the Trusts. Such payments are made by   
the Sponsor out of its own assets, and not out of the assets of the Trusts.     
These programs will not change the price Unitholders pay for their Units or the 
amount that the Trusts will receive from the Units sold.                        

Market for Units. Although not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to 
maintain a market for Units and offer to purchase Units at prices, subject to   
change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid prices of the bonds plus       
accrued interest and any principal cash on hand, less any amounts representing  
taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the Trust and less any       
accrued Trust expenses. If the supply of Units exceeds demand or if some other  
business reason warrants it, the Sponsor may either discontinue all purchases   
of Units or discontinue purchases of Units at these prices. If a market is not  
maintained and the Unitholder cannot find another purchaser, a Unitholder will  
be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to the Trustee for redemption at  
the Redemption Price. See "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". A       
Unitholder who wishes to dispose of his Units should inquire of his broker as   
to current market prices in order to determine whether there is in any price in 
excess of the Redemption Price and, if so, the amount thereof. The Trustee will 
notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for redemption. If the Sponsor's bid  
in the secondary market at that time equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per 
Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which the Units would 
otherwise have been redeemed by the Trustee.                                    

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions of Interest and Principal. Unitholders who purchase Units in
the secondary market will receive distributions in accordance with the          
election, if any, of the prior owner. Interest received by a Trust, pro rated   
on an annual basis, will be distributed monthly unless the prior owner of your  
Units elected to receive quarterly or semi-annual distributions. Certain Trusts 
offer only monthly distribution options while others offer only monthly and     
semi-annual distribution options. A Trust that has elected to be structured as  
a "regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes may make additional   
distributions at the end of each year.                                          

Interest received by a Trust, including that part of the proceeds of any  
disposition of bonds which represents accrued interest, is credited by the      
Trustee to the Interest Account. Other receipts are credited to the Principal   
Account. Interest received will be distributed on each distribution date to     
Unitholders of record as of the preceding record date. All distributions will   
be net of estimated expenses. The Trustee is not required to pay interest on    
funds held in the Principal or Interest Account (but may itself earn interest   
thereon and therefore benefits from the use of these funds).                    

For a Trust with a Date of Deposit prior to April 21, 2009, funds in the  
Principal Account will be distributed on each semi-annual distribution date to  
Unitholders of record as of the preceding semi-annual record date. The Trustee  
is not required to make a distribution from the Principal Account unless the    
amount available for distribution therein shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.  
However, should the amount available for distribution in the Principal Account  
equal or exceed $10.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a special distribution   
from the Principal Account on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders 
of record on the related monthly record date.                                   

For a Trust with a Date of Deposit on or after April 21, 2009, should the 
amount available for distribution in the Principal Account equal or exceed      
$5.00 per Unit, the Trustee will make a distribution from the Principal Account 
on the next monthly distribution date to Unitholders of record on the related   
monthly record date. However, funds in the Principal Account will be            
distributed on the last distribution date of each calendar year to Unitholders  
of record as of the preceding record date if the amount available for           
distribution shall equal at least $1.00 per Unit.                               

Because interest payments are not received by a Trust at a constant rate  
throughout the year, interest distributions may be more or less than the amount 
credited to the Interest Account as of the record date. For the purpose of      
minimizing fluctuations in interest distributions, the Trustee is authorized to 
advance amounts necessary to provide interest distributions of approximately    
equal amounts. The Trustee is reimbursed for these advances from funds in the   
Interest Account on the next record date. Persons who purchase Units between a  
record date and a distribution date will receive their first distribution on    
the second distribution date after the purchase, under the applicable plan of   
distribution.                                                                   

Redemption of Units. All or a portion of your Units may be tendered to The
Bank of New York Mellon, the Trustee, for redemption at Unit Investment Trust   
Division, 111 Sanders Creek Parkway, East Syracuse, New York 13057, on any day  
the New York Stock Exchange is open. No redemption fee will be charged by the   
Sponsor or the Trustee, but you are responsible for applicable governmental     
charges, if any. Units redeemed by the Trustee will be canceled. You may redeem 
all or a portion of your Units by sending a request for redemption to your bank 
or broker-dealer through which you hold your Units. No later than three         
business days following satisfactory tender, the Unitholder will receive an     
amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed after 
receipt by the Trustee of the tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed   
to be the date on which Units are received by the Trustee, except that as       
regards Units received after the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange, the date of tender is the next day on which that Exchange  
is open and the Units will be deemed to have been tendered to the Trustee on    
that day for redemption at the Redemption Price. Redemption requests received   
by authorized financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are     
properly transmitted to the Trustee by the time designated by the Trustee, are  
priced based on the date of receipt. Redemption requests received by the        
Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by          
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption      
requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until 
after the time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the   
next determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the       
Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial          
professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee   
so they will be received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling  
firms may charge an order handling fee for processing redemption requests.      
Units redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.       

 Under Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") regulations, the Trustee is required
to withhold a specified percentage of a Unit redemption if the Trustee has not  
received the Unitholder's tax identification number as required by such         
regulations. Any amount withheld is transmitted to the IRS and may be recovered 
by the Unitholder only when filing a return. Under normal circumstances the     
Trustee obtains the Unitholder's tax identification number from the selling     
broker. However, at any time a Unitholder elects to tender Units for            
redemption, the Unitholder should provide a tax identification number to the    
Trustee in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding".                  

The Redemption Price per Unit (as well as the secondary market Public     
Offering Price) will be determined on the basis of the bid price of the bonds   
as of the Evaluation Time on days of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on  
the date any such determination is made. The Evaluator determines the           
Redemption Price per Unit on days Units are tendered for redemption. The        
Redemption Price per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit on the basis of    
(i) the cash on hand in the Trust or moneys in the process of being collected,  
(ii) the value of the bonds based on the bid prices of the bonds, except for    
cases in which the value of insurance (if any) has been included, (iii) accrued 
interest, less (a) amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges and 
(b) the accrued Trust expenses. The Evaluator may determine the value of the    
bonds by employing any of the methods set forth in "Public Offering--Offering   
Price". Accrued interest paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the         
Interest Account or, if the balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal 
Account. All other amounts will be withdrawn from the Principal Account. Units  
so redeemed shall be cancelled.                                                 

The price at which Units may be redeemed could be less than the price paid
by the Unitholder and may be less than the par value of the bonds represented   
by the Units redeemed. The Trustee may sell bonds to cover redemptions. When    
bonds are sold, the size and diversity of the Trust will be reduced. Sales may  
be required at a time when bonds would not otherwise be sold and might result   
in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                               

   In addition, with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 654 and
subsequent series, the Trustee reserves the right to satisfy any redemption of  
1,000 or more Units with an aggregate redemption price of $1,000,000 or more in 
an in kind distribution of bonds. An in kind distribution of bonds will be made 
by the Trustee through the distribution of each of the bonds in the Trust in    
book-entry form to the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository  
Trust Company. Amounts representing fractional portions of a bond will be       
distributed in cash. The Trustee may adjust the bonds included in a Unitholder's
in kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole bonds. Special tax 
consequences will result if a Unitholder receives an in kind distribution. See  
"Tax Status".                                                                   

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any    
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for       
customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the SEC determines that 
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the bonds is not reasonably practicable, or for 
other periods as the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") may by      
order permit. Under certain extreme circumstances the Sponsor may apply to the  
SEC for an order permitting a full or partial suspension of the right of        
Unitholders to redeem their Units.                                              

Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Trust or when your Trust   
terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other Invesco   
unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. An exchange does not avoid a taxable     
disposition of your redeemed Units. You should contact your financial           
professional for more information about trusts currently available for          
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax          
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time. The exchange will     
generally be treated as a sale and a taxable transaction for federal and state  
income tax purposes.                                                            

 Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form only and will not
be evidenced by certificates. Units purchased or held through your bank or      
broker-dealer will be recorded in book-entry form and credited to the account   
of your bank or broker-dealer at the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"). Units    
are transferable by contacting your bank or broker-dealer through which you     
hold your Units. Transfer, and the requirements therefore, will be governed by  
the applicable procedures of DTC and your agreement with the DTC participant in 
whose name your Units are registered on the transfer records of DTC.            

  Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of interest and other
receipts received for each distribution. For as long as the Sponsor deems it to 
be in the best interest of Unitholders, the accounts of each Trust will be      
audited annually by an independent registered public accounting firm and the    
report of the accountants will be furnished to Unitholders upon request. Within 
a reasonable period of time after the end of each year, the Trustee will        
furnish to each person who was a registered Unitholder during that year a       
statement describing the interest and principal received on the bonds, actual   
Trust distributions, Trust expenses, a list of the bonds and other Trust        
information. Unitholders will be furnished the Evaluator's evaluations of the   
bonds upon request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account 
or your Trust, please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The        
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information.                 

INSURANCE ON THE BONDS IN THE INSURED TRUSTS                                    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Insurance may have been obtained guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and
principal, when due, in respect of some or all of the bonds in your Trust. The  
premium for any Preinsured Bond Insurance has been paid by the issuer, by a     
prior owner of the bonds and any policy is non-cancelable and will continue in  
force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the Preinsured Bond   
Insurer remains in business. More detailed information regarding insurance on   
the bonds and the Preinsured Bond Insurer is included in the Information        
Supplement. See "Additional Information".                                       

FUND ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sponsor. Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. is the Sponsor of your Trust. The  
Sponsor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco Advisers, Inc. ("Invesco        
Advisers"). Invesco Advisers is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Invesco  
Ltd., a leading independent global investment manager that provides a wide range
of investment strategies and vehicles to its retail, institutional and high net 
worth clients around the globe. The Sponsor's principal office is located at 11 
Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas 77046-1173. As of March 31, 2016, the total      
stockholders' equity of Invesco Capital Markets, Inc. was $101,917,587.56       
(unaudited). The current assets under management and supervision by Invesco Ltd.
and its affiliates were valued at approximately $771.5 billion as of March 31,
2016.                                                                           

The Sponsor and your Trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring Invesco
Ltd.'s employees who have access to information on Trust transactions to report 
personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code is to avoid potential 
conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with        
respect to your Trust. The Information Supplement contains additional           
information about the Sponsor.                                                  

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust    
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate the Trusts as      
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

Trustee. The Trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company      
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its       
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, 
Brooklyn, New York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. If you have any questions   
regarding your account or your Trust, please contact the Trustee at its         
principal unit investment trust division offices or your financial advisor. The 
Sponsor does not have access to individual account information. The Bank of New 
York Mellon is subject to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of  
Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal        
Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance   
Corporation to the extent permitted by law. Additional information regarding    
the Trustee is set forth in the Information Supplement, including the Trustee's 
qualifications and duties, its ability to resign, the effect of a merger        
involving the Trustee and the Sponsor's ability to remove and replace the       
Trustee. See "Additional Information".                                          

Portfolio Administration. The Trusts are not managed funds and, except as 
provided in the Trust Agreement, bonds generally will not be sold or replaced.  
The Sponsor may, however, direct that bonds be sold in certain limited          
situations to protect the Trust based on advice from the Supervisor. These      
situations may include default in interest or principal payments on the bonds   
or other obligations of an issuer, an advanced refunding or institution of      
certain legal proceedings. In addition, the Trustee may sell bonds designated   
by the Supervisor for purposes of redeeming Units or payment of expenses. The   
Supervisor will consider a variety of factors in designating bonds to be sold   
including interest rates, market value and marketability. Except in limited     
circumstances, the Trustee will generally reject (and must reject with respect  
to any Trust deposited on or before August 1, 2006) any offer by an issuer to   
issue bonds in exchange or substitution for the bonds (such as a refunding or   
refinancing plan). The Trustee will promptly notify Unitholders of any exchange 
or substitution. The Information Supplement contains a more detailed            
description of circumstances in which bonds may be sold or replaced. See        
"Additional Information".                                                       

  If a Trust is structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax
purposes, the Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of    
bonds if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, 
in the opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the bonds detrimental to 
the Trust. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the 
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria    
for inclusion in the trust on the Date of Deposit. The Sponsor may also         
instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that such a Trust       
continues to satisfy the a regulated investment company and to avoid imposition 
of tax on undistributed income of the Trust.                                    

Replacement Bonds. No assurance can be given that a Trust will retain its 
present size or composition because bonds may be sold, redeemed or mature from  
time to time and the proceeds will be distributed to Unitholders and will not   
be reinvested. In the event of a failure to deliver any bond that has been      
purchased under a contract ("Failed Bonds"), the Sponsor is authorized under    
the Trust Agreement to direct the Trustee to acquire other bonds ("Replacement
Bonds") to make up the original portfolio of a Trust. Replacement Bonds must be 
purchased within 20 days after delivery of the notice of the failed contract    
and the purchase price (exclusive of accrued interest) may not exceed the       
amount of funds reserved for the purchase of the Failed Bonds. The Replacement  
Bonds must be substantially identical to the Failed Bonds in terms of (i) the   
exemption from federal and state taxation, (ii) maturity, (iii) yield to        
maturity and current return, (iv) Standard & Poor's or Moody's ratings, and (v) 
insurance on a bond in an Insured Trust. The Trustee shall notify all           
Unitholders of a Trust within five days after the acquisition of a Replacement  
Bond and shall make a pro rata distribution of the amount, if any, by which the 
cost of the Failed Bond exceeded the cost of the Replacement Bond plus accrued  
interest. If Failed Bonds are not replaced, the Sponsor will refund the sales   
charge attributable to the Failed Bonds to all Unitholders of the Trust and     
distribute the principal and accrued interest (at the coupon rate of the Failed 
Bonds to the date of removal from the Trust) attributable to the Failed Bonds   
within 30 days after removal. All interest paid to a Unitholder which accrued   
after the expected date of settlement for Units will be paid by the Sponsor and 
accordingly will not be treated as tax-exempt income. If Failed Bonds are not   
replaced, the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit would be reduced    
and the Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return might be        
lowered. Unitholders may not be able to reinvest their proceeds in other        
securities at a yield equal to or in excess of the yield of the Failed Bonds.   

Amendment of Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and the Trustee may amend the   
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially     
adversely affect the interest of the Unitholders (as determined in good faith   
by the Sponsor and the Trustee) or to maintain the tax status of a Trust. The   
Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units or to permit 
the acquisition of bonds in addition to or in substitution for any of the bonds 
initially deposited in a Trust, except for the substitution of certain          
refunding bonds. The Trustee will notify Unitholders of any amendment.          

 Termination of Trust Agreement. A Trust will terminate upon the redemption,
sale or other disposition of the last bond held in the Trust. A Trust may also  
be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the Units then    
outstanding (or, with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Municipal Series 654   
and subsequent series, by consent of Unitholders of 75% of the Units then       
outstanding) or by the Trustee when the value of the Trust is less than 20% of  
the original principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the       
Trustee in the event that a sufficient number of Units not yet sold are tendered
for redemption by the Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the net worth
of such Trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the initial principal amount 
of such Trust. If a Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold     
Units by the Underwriter, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the
entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trustee will notify each        
Unitholder of any termination within a reasonable time and will then liquidate  
any remaining bonds. The sale of bonds upon termination may result in a lower   
amount than might otherwise be realized if the sale was not required at that    
time. For this reason, among others, the amount realized by a Unitholder upon   
termination may be less than the principal amount of bonds per Unit or value at 
the time of purchase. The Trustee will distribute to each Unitholder his share  
of the balance of the Interest and Principal Accounts after deduction of costs, 
expenses or indemnities. The Unitholder will receive a final distribution       
statement with this distribution. When the Trustee in its sole discretion       
determines that any amounts held in reserve are no longer necessary, it will    
distribute these amounts to Unitholders. The Information Supplement contains    
further information regarding termination of a Trust. See "Additional
Information".                                                                   

Limitation on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee 
shall be under no liability to Unitholders for taking any action or for         
refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to the Trust           
Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but shall be liable only for their own    
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence (negligence in the case of   
the Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by reason of their reckless  
disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder. The Trustee shall not be   
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the Trustee   
of any of the bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor to act under    
the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not be liable for 
any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement. The Trustee is  
not liable for any taxes or governmental charges imposed on the bonds, on it as 
Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on the Fund which the Trustee may be       
required to pay under any present or future law of the United States of America 
or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Trust    
Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
Trustee. The Trustee and Sponsor may rely on any evaluation furnished by the    
Evaluator and have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof. Determinations   
by the Evaluator shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best         
information available to it; provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be     
under no liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unitholders for errors in         
judgment.                                                                       

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grantor Trusts                                                                  

This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax     
consequences of owning Units of a Trust that has been structured to be treated  
as a grantor trust for federal tax purposes. Please see "Notes to Financial     
Statements" in Prospectus Part I. Tax laws and interpretations change           
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to  
all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your      
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a       
tax-exempt entity, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,   
this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences of 
an investment in a Trust.                                                       

This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and opinion
of counsel to the Sponsor. The IRS could disagree with any conclusions set      
forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the     
federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trust. The    
Trust may be subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its     
compliance and reporting obligations.                                           

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Assets of the Trust. The Trust will hold various debt obligations (the    
"Bonds") of state and local governmental entities that constitute debt the      
interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes 
as described below. It is possible that the Trust will also hold other assets,  
including assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes   
from those described above, in which case you will have federal income tax      
consequences different from or in addition to those described in this section.  
All of the assets held by the Trust constitute the "Trust Assets." Neither our  
counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the     
Trust Assets.                                                                   

Trust Status. If the Trust is at all times operated in accordance with the
documents establishing the Trust and certain requirements of federal income tax 
law are met, the Trust will not be taxed as a corporation for federal income tax
purposes. As a Unit owner, you will be treated as the owner of a pro rata       
portion of each of the Trust Assets, and as such you will be considered to have 
received a pro rata share of income (e.g., interest, accruals of original issue 
discount and market discount, and capital gains, if any) from each Trust Asset  
when such income would be considered to be received by you if you directly owned
the Trust Assets. This is true even if you elect to have your distributions     
reinvested into additional Units. In addition, the income from Trust Assets that
you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by    
amounts used to pay sales charges or Trust expenses.                            

  Exclusion from Gross Income of Interest. At the respective times of issuance
of the Bonds, opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of 
interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the 
respective issuing authorities, based on certain representations and subject to 
compliance with certain covenants. Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel have     
made any special review for the Trust of the proceedings relating to the        
issuance of the Bonds, the bases for the bond counsel opinions, or compliance   
with the covenants required for tax-exemption. The IRS has an ongoing program   
of auditing tax-exempt obligations to determine whether, in the view of the     
IRS, interest on such tax-exempt obligations is includible in the gross income  
of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. It cannot be predicted   
whether or not the IRS will commence an audit of any of the Bonds. If an audit  
is commenced, under current procedures of the IRS, Unitholders may have no      
right to participate in such procedure. If the interest on a Bond should be     
determined to be taxable, the Bond would generally have to be sold at a         
substantial discount. In addition, investors could be required to pay income    
tax on interest received both prior to and after the date on which interest is  
determined to be taxable.                                                       

Your pro rata share of interest on the Bonds will be excluded from your   
gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same extent that such       
interest would be excluded from your gross income if you directly owned the     
Bonds. However, such interest may be taken into account in computing the        
alternative minimum tax, and the branch profits tax imposed on certain foreign  
corporations.                                                                   

Ownership of the Units may result in collateral federal income tax        
consequences to certain Unit holders, including, without limitation,            
corporations subject to the branch profits tax, financial institutions, certain 
insurance companies, certain S corporations, individual recipients of Social    
Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and Unit holders who may be deemed to  
have incurred (or continued) indebtedness to purchase or carry tax-exempt       
obligations.                                                                    

  If you are a "substantial user" of the facilities financed with the proceeds
of certain Bonds, or a related person to a substantial user, you will not be    
able to exclude from your gross income interest with respect to these Bonds.    
"Substantial user" and "related person" are defined under federal income tax    
law.                                                                            

For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and 
corporations, interest on certain bonds is included as an item of tax           
preference.                                                                     

In the case of certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax depends  
upon the corporation's alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is    
the corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the           
adjustment items used in computing AMTI of a corporation (excluding S           
Corporations, Regulated Investment Companies, Real Estate Investment Trusts,    
REMICs or FASITs) is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such corporation's 
"adjusted current earnings" over an amount equal to its AMTI (before such       
adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating loss deduction).          
"Adjusted current earnings" includes all tax-exempt interest, including         
interest on all of the Bonds in the Trust. However, legislation added in 2009   
provides that interest on tax-exempt bonds issued in 2009 and 2010 is not       
included in the corporate adjustment based on current earnings. In addition, a  
branch profits tax is levied on the "effectively connected earnings and         
profits" of certain foreign corporations, which include tax-exempt interest,    
such as interest on the Bonds in the Trust.                                     

Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss upon Disposition. If your Trust disposes
of Trust Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you dispose of   
your Units or redeem your Units for cash, you will also generally recognize     
gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must subtract   
your adjusted tax basis in the related Trust Assets from your share of the      
total amount received in the transaction. You can generally determine your      
initial tax basis in each Trust Asset by apportioning the cost of your Units,   
including sales charges, among the Trust Assets ratably according to their      
values on the date you acquire your Units. In certain circumstances, however,   
you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your Units (for         
example, in the case of accruals of original issue discount, market discount,   
premium and accrued interest, as discussed below).                              

   Dividends and net capital gains also are subject to a 3.8% federal tax on net
investment income for taxpayers at higher income levels.                        

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital 
gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as  
for ordinary income.                                                            

Discount, Accrued Interest and Premium on Bonds. Some Bonds may have been 
issued with original issue discount. This generally means that the Bonds were   
originally issued at a price below their face (or par) value. Original issue    
discount accrues on a daily basis and generally is treated as interest income   
for federal income tax purposes. Thus, the accrual of original discount will be 
excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes to the same     
extent as interest on the Bonds, as discussed above. Your basis of each Bond    
that was issued with original issue discount must be increased as original issue
discount accrues.                                                               

Some Bonds may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a market       
discount. Market discount is generally the excess of the stated redemption      
price at maturity for the Bond over the purchase price of the Bond. Market      
discount can arise based on the price your Trust pays for a Bond or based on    
the price you pay for your Units. Market discount is taxed as ordinary income.  
You will recognize this income when your Trust receives principal payments on   
the Bond, when the Bond is disposed of or redeemed, or when you sell or redeem  
your Units. Alternatively, you may elect to include market discount in taxable  
income as it accrues. Whether or not you make this election will affect how you 
calculate your basis and the timing of certain interest expense deductions.     

 Alternatively, some Bonds may have been purchased by you or your Trust at a
premium. Generally, if the tax basis of your pro rata portion of any Bond,      
generally including sales charges, exceeds the amount payable at maturity, such 
excess is considered premium. You must amortize bond premium on a constant      
yield basis over the remaining term of the Bond in a manner that takes into     
account potential call dates and call prices. You cannot deduct amortized bond  
premium relating to a Bond. The amortized bond premium is treated as a          
reduction in the tax-exempt interest received. As bond premium is amortized, it 
reduces your basis in the Bond. The tax basis reduction requirement may result  
in your realizing a taxable gain when your Units are sold or redeemed for an    
amount equal to or less than your cost.                                         

If the price of your Units includes accrued interest on a Bond, you must  
include the accrued interest in your tax basis in that Bond. When your Trust    
receives this accrued interest, you must treat it as a return of capital and    
reduce your tax basis in the Bond.                                              

This discussion provides only the general rules with respect to the tax   
treatment of original issue discount, market discount and premium. The rules,   
however, are complex and special rules apply in certain circumstances. For      
example, the accrual of market discount or premium may differ from the          
discussion set forth above in the case of Bonds that were issued with original  
issue discount.                                                                 

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust, it is considered a sale  
for federal income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a   
capital gain, and, in general, any loss will be treated as a capital loss.      
However, any loss you incur in connection with the exchange of your Units of    
your Trusts for units of the next series will generally be disallowed with      
respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed repurchase, to the extent the 
two trusts have substantially identical Trust Assets under the wash sale        
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").       

In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this   
prospectus, you may request an In Kind Distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units. By electing to receive an In Kind Distribution, you will     
receive Trust Assets plus, possibly, cash. You will not recognize gain or loss  
if you only receive whole Trust Assets in exchange for the identical amount of  
your pro rata portion of the same Trust Assets held by your Trust. However, if  
you also receive cash in exchange for a Trust Asset or a fractional portion of  
a Trust Asset, you will generally recognize gain or loss based on the           
difference between the amount of cash you receive and your tax basis in such    
Trust Asset or fractional portion.                                              

Limitations on the Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, for federal
income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share of     
your Trust's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Trust expenses. 
You may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your Trust to the    
same extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be required to treat   
some or all of the expenses of your Trust as miscellaneous itemized deductions. 
Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized deductions to the    
extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income. Your ability to deduct Trust    
expenses is also limited to the extent the expenses are allocable to tax-exempt 
interest from the Trust.                                                        

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Trust's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross 
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if paid  
to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial   
institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due  
diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the   
foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it identifies certain  
of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under   
FATCA. If required under the rules above and subject to the applicability of any
intergovernmental agreements between the United States and the relevant foreign 
country, withholding under FATCA applies: (i) with respect to distributions from
your Trust and (ii) with respect to certain capital gains distributions and     
gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of Units that occur on or after       
January 1, 2019. If withholding is required under FATCA on a payment related to 
your Units, investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or    
that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such      
payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to   
obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Your Trust will not pay any  
additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should       
consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual 
circumstances.                                                                  

Regulated Investment Companies                                                  

This section summarizes some of the principal U.S. federal income tax     
consequences of owning Units of a Trust that intends to qualify as a "regulated 
investment company" under the federal tax laws. Please see "Notes to Financial  
Statements" in Prospectus Part I. Tax laws and interpretations change           
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to  
all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do not describe your      
situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, a       
tax-exempt entity, or other investor with special circumstances. In addition,   
this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax consequences of 
an investment in a Trust.                                                       

  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The IRS could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this      
section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review the federal income    
tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Trusts. A Trust may be       
subject to penalties under federal tax law with respect to its compliance and   
reporting obligations.                                                          

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Trust Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify annually as   
"regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. If a Trust         
qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as       
required by the tax law, such Trust generally will not pay federal income       
taxes. In addition, such Trusts intend to hold a sufficient amount of their     
assets in bonds that are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation so as to      
qualify to distribute exempt-interest dividends to Unitholders. Such            
exempt-interest dividends are not subject to regular U.S. federal income tax,   
but may be subject to the alternative minimum tax. The Trusts may hold bonds    
issued by the Government of Puerto Rico or under its authority. Such bonds are  
exempt from taxation by the U.S. federal government, the government of Puerto   
Rico, any state or its political subdivisions, any possession of the United     
States, or the District of Columbia.                                            

 Distributions. After the end of each year, you will receive a tax statement
that specifies your amounts of exempt-interest dividends, ordinary income       
distributions and capital gains dividends. Exempt-interest dividends generally  
are excluded from your gross income for federal income tax purposes. Some or    
all of the exempt-interest dividends, however, may be taken into account in     
determining your alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences    
(e.g., they may affect the amount of your social security benefits that are     
taxed). Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your federal tax   
rate for ordinary income. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends 
as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares.   
In addition, the Trust may make distributions that represent a return of        
capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you. The tax 
status of your distributions from your Trust is not affected by whether you     
reinvest your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash. The   
income from your Trust that you must take into account for federal income tax   
purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. 
The tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in January as   
if you had received them on December 31 of the previous year.                   

Dividends Received Deduction and Qualified Dividend Income. A corporation 
that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received        
deduction with respect to dividends received from a Trust because the dividends 
received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated  
investment companies that do not invest in stock. An individual that owns Units 
generally will not be entitled to treat dividends received from a Trust as      
qualified dividend income currently taxed at long-term capital gains rates      
because it is not expected that such dividends will be attributable to          
qualified dividend income received by such Trust.                               

Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will   
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this     
gain or loss, you must subtract your adjusted tax basis in your Units from the  
amount you receive in the transaction. Your tax basis in your Units is          
generally equal to the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges.   
In some cases, however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you         
purchase your Units. Further, if you hold your Units for six months or less,    
any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such a Unit will be      
disallowed to the extent of the exempt-interest dividends you received, if      
any.                                                                            

  Capital Gains and Losses. Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain
minus net short-term capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is 
long-term if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is      
short-term if the holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must    
exclude the date you purchase your Units to determine your holding period.      
However, if you receive a capital gain dividend from your Trust and sell your   
Unit at a loss after holding it for six months or less, the loss will be        
disallowed to the extent of the exempt-interest dividends you received. To the  
extent, if any, it is not disallowed, it will be recharacterized as long-term   
capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates 
for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally  
the same as for ordinary income. The Code treats certain capital gains as       
ordinary income in special situations.                                          

There is no requirement that tax consequences be taken into account in    
administering your Portfolio.                                                   

Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Trust rolled over 
into a future Invesco-sponsored unit investment trust, the exchange would       
generally be considered a sale and a taxable transaction for federal income tax 
purposes.                                                                       

In Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this  
prospectus, you may receive an in kind distribution of Trust Assets when you    
redeem your Units. This distribution will be treated as a sale for federal      
income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain or loss, generally    
based on the value at that time of the securities and the amount of cash        
received, and subject to certain limitations on the deductibility of losses     
under the tax rules.                                                            

 Deductibility of Trust Expenses. Generally, expenses incurred by your Trust
will be deducted from the gross income received by your Trust and only your     
share of the Trust's net taxable income, if any, will be paid to you and        
reported as taxable income to you. However, if the Units of your Trust are held 
by fewer than 500 Unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your Trust     
will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus         
resulting in your reported share of your Trust's taxable income being increased 
by your share of those expenses, even though you do not receive a corresponding 
cash distribution. In this case you may be able to take a deduction for these   
expenses; however, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as           
investment expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all 
of these deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.        

  Further, because the Trusts pay exempt-interest dividends, which are treated
as exempt interest for federal income tax purposes, you will not be able to     
deduct some of your interest expense for debt that you incur or continue to     
purchase or carry your Units.                                                   

Investors may be subject to state, local, or foreign taxes in connection  
with their investment in a Trust. Investors are encouraged to consult their own 
tax advisors regarding the specific federal (including the federal alternative  
minimum tax), state, local, and foreign tax consequences that may affect them   
as a result of an investment in a Trust.                                        

The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act ("FATCA"). A 30% withholding tax on
your Trust's distributions, including capital gains distributions, and on gross 
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Units generally applies if paid  
to a foreign entity unless: (i) if the foreign entity is a "foreign financial   
institution" as defined under FATCA, the foreign entity undertakes certain due  
diligence, reporting, withholding, and certification obligations, (ii) if the   
foreign entity is not a "foreign financial institution," it identifies certain  
of its U.S. investors or (iii) the foreign entity is otherwise excepted under   
FATCA. If required under the rules above and subject to the applicability of any
intergovernmental agreements between the United States and the relevant foreign 
country, withholding under FATCA applies: (i) with respect to distributions from
your Portfolio and (ii) with respect to certain capital gains distributions and 
gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of Units that occur on or after       
January 1, 2019. If withholding is required under FATCA on a payment related to 
your Units, investors that otherwise would not be subject to withholding (or    
that otherwise would be entitled to a reduced rate of withholding) on such      
payment generally will be required to seek a refund or credit from the IRS to   
obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Your Trust will not pay any  
additional amounts in respect of amounts withheld under FATCA. You should       
consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of FATCA based on your individual 
circumstances.                                                                  

STATE TRUST RISK FACTORS AND TAX STATUS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

State Tax Exemptions In General                                                 

The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the ability of the states to provide a  
state tax exemption for interest derived from in-state municipal bonds while    
subjecting interest derived from municipal bonds issued by other states and     
their political subdivisions to tax. The Court's decision affirms current       
market practice and should not impact the state and local income and franchise  
tax treatment of distributions from the Trusts as described herein.             

Grantor Trusts                                                                  

 California Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of California
is affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies    
and conditions. Additionally, limitations imposed by constitutional amendments, 
legislative measures, or voter initiatives on the State and its local           
governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and other matters may constrain 
the revenue-generating capacity of the State and its local governments and,     
therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds to satisfy their             
obligations.                                                                    

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors, such as natural disasters, complications with     
exports and industry deregulation.                                              

 California state and local government obligations may be adversely affected
by political and economic conditions and developments within California and the 
nation as a whole. Since the end of the recession, both the state and the U.S.  
have been in the midst of a modest, drawn-out recovery from the economic        
downturn. California's Legislature, in addition to adopting severe budget cuts  
and temporary tax increases, deferred numerous payment obligations to schools   
and local governments in order to resolve the State's multibillion dollar       
budget gaps during the downturn. With the improvements to the State's budgetary 
and fiscal condition, addressing these outstanding obligations as well as       
California's significant unfunded pension liabilities has become a priority in  
the state's budget. Consensus among economists is that the economic outlook for 
the State will continue to improve in the near term however, the economy and    
California's fiscal condition remain subject to various fiscal risks and        
pressures which could adversely affect the state's recovery or result in a      
return to budget deficits.                                                      

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

 Further information concerning California risk factors may be obtained upon
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

California Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above.                                                  

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--California Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes  
of this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of    
this prospectus.                                                                

  This section summarizes some of the California tax consequences to residents
of the State of California of owning Units of a California Trust (the "Trust")  
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The California taxing authorities could       
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

At the time of the closing, special California tax counsel ("California   
Counsel") to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below      
addressing certain California tax consequences under then-existing California   
income tax law to Unitholders subject to California income tax.                 

California Counsel examined the income tax laws of the State of California
to determine their applicability to the Trust and to the holders of Units in    
the Trust who are full-time residents of the State of California ("California   
Unitholders"). The assets of the Trust will consist of bonds issued by the      
State of California or a local government of California (the "California        
Bonds") or by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or its authority (the "Possession 
Bonds", and together with the California Bonds, the "Bonds"). For purposes of   
rendering its opinions at closing, California Counsel assumed that each asset   
of the Trust will be debt, the interest on which is excluded from gross income  
for federal income tax purposes.                                                

Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor California Counsel has          
independently examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust.      
However, although California Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to the   
issuance of the Bonds, in rendering its opinion at closing it assumed that: (i) 
the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from     
gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (iii) interest on the Bonds,  
if received directly by a California Unitholder, would be exempt from the       
income tax imposed by the State of California that is applicable to             
individuals, trusts and estates (the "California Personal Income Tax"). The     
opinion of California Counsel did not address the taxation of persons other     
than full time residents of California. California Counsel assumed that, at the 
respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions that the Bonds were validly 
issued and that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal 
income tax purposes were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing     
authorities. In addition, California Counsel assumed that, with respect to the  
California Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions     
that the interest on the California Bonds is exempt from the California         
Personal Income Tax and, with respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to  
the issuing authorities rendered opinions that the Possession Bonds and the     
interest thereon is exempt from all state and local income taxation. Neither    
the Sponsor nor its counsel nor California Counsel made any review for the      
Trust of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the basis  
for the opinions rendered in connection therewith.                              

Based upon the foregoing, and upon an investigation of such matters of law
as California Counsel considered to be applicable, California Counsel rendered  
its opinion to the Trust at closing that, under then-existing California law:   

    (1)  The Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation for purposes
         of the California Corporation Tax Law, and each California Unitholder
        will be treated as the owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust, and
         the income of such portion of the Trust will be treated as the income
         of the California Unitholders for purposes of the California Personal
Income Tax.                                                 

  (2)  Interest on the Bonds which is exempt from tax under the California
      Personal Income Tax when received by the Trust, and which would be
 excludable from California taxable income for purposes of the
       California Personal Income Tax if received directly by a California
     Unitholder, will be excludable from California taxable income for
       purposes of the California Personal Income Tax when received by the
Trust and distributed to a California Unitholder.           

    (3)  Each California Unitholder of the Trust will generally recognize gain
      or loss for California Personal Income Tax purposes if the Trustee
         disposes of a Bond (whether by redemption, sale or otherwise) or when
         the California Unitholder redeems or sells Units of the Trust, to the
          extent that such a transaction results in a recognized gain or loss to
        such California Unitholder for federal income tax purposes. However,
         there are certain differences between the recognition of gain or loss
          for federal income tax purposes and for California Personal Income Tax
         purposes, and California Unitholders are advised to consult their own
tax advisors. Tax basis reduction requirements relating to  
         amortization of bond premium may, under some circumstances, result in
          a California Unitholder realizing taxable gain for California Personal
     Income Tax purposes when a Unit is sold or redeemed for an amount
equal to or less than its original cost.                    

 (4)  Under the California Personal Income Tax, interest on indebtedness
         incurred or continued by a California Unitholder to purchase Units in
       the Trust is not deductible for purposes of the California Personal
Income Tax.                                                 

The opinion of California Counsel was limited to California Unitholders   
subject to the California Personal Income Tax. No opinion was expressed with    
respect to the taxation of California Unitholders subject to the California     
Corporation Tax Law, and such California Unitholders are advised to consult     
their own tax advisors. California Counsel did note, however, that interest on  
the underlying Bonds attributed to a California Unitholder that is subject to   
the California Corporation Tax Law may be includible in its gross income for    
purposes of determining its California franchise tax. California Counsel did    
not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in the Trust or the       
proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond counsel with       
respect thereto, and California Counsel expressed no opinion with respect to    
taxation under any other provisions of California law.                          

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other California tax       
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Georgia Risk Factors. The financial condition of the State of Georgia is  
affected by various national, economic, social and environmental policies and   
conditions. Additionally, Constitutional and statutory limitations imposed on   
the State and its local governments concerning taxes, bond indebtedness and     
other matters may constrain the revenue-generating capacity of the State and    
its local governments and, therefore, the ability of the issuers of the Bonds   
to satisfy their obligations. Historically, the State has experienced           
significant revenue shortfalls.                                                 

The economic vitality of the State and its various regions and, therefore,
the ability of the State and its local governments to satisfy the Bonds, are    
affected by numerous factors. Weather conditions may have a significant impact  
on Georgia's agricultural sector. In the past, widespread flooding in central   
and southern Georgia has caused extensive damage and destruction of farmland,   
private residences, businesses and local and state government facilities.       

The State may be a party to numerous lawsuits in which an adverse final   
decision could materially affect the State's governmental operations and        
consequently its ability to pay debt service on its obligations.                

Further information concerning Georgia risk factors may be obtained upon  
request to the Sponsor as described in "Additional Information".                

Georgia Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to qualify as "grantor trusts"  
under the federal tax laws. For a discussion of the federal tax treatment of    
income earned on Units of a Trust that is a grantor trust, see "Federal Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts" above. The discussion below reflects the state-specific 
tax opinion of outside counsel provided for an initial deposit of a trust       
series, which may not fully reflect the current state-specific tax consequences 
of owning Trust Units. The Sponsor's counsel does not provide an opinion with   
respect to the state-specific tax consequences of owning Trust Units.           

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Grantor Trusts--Georgia Tax Status" are defined solely for purposes of  
this subsection and are not defined terms applicable to other sections of this  
prospectus.                                                                     

  This section summarizes some of the Georgia tax consequences to residents of
the State of Georgia of owning Units of the Georgia IM-IT Trust (the "Trust")   
treated as a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. Tax laws and        
interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of   
the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on the     
advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The Georgia taxing authorities could disagree 
with any conclusions set forth in this section.                                 

 At the time of the closing, special Georgia tax counsel ("Georgia Counsel")
to the Trust rendered an opinion substantially in the form below addressing     
certain Georgia tax consequences under then-existing Georgia income tax law to  
Unitholders subject to Georgia income tax.                                      

 The assets of the Trust will consist of interest-bearing obligations issued
by or on behalf of the State of Georgia or counties, municipalities,            
authorities or political subdivisions thereof (the "Georgia Bonds") and certain 
bonds issued by Puerto Rico authorities (the "Possession Bonds", and together   
with the Georgia Bonds, the "Bonds").                                           

 Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, nor Georgia Counsel has independently
examined the Bonds to be deposited in and held in the Trust. However, although  
no opinion is expressed herein regarding such matters, it is assumed that (i)   
the Bonds were validly issued, (ii) the interest thereon is excludable from     
gross income for federal income tax purposes, and (iii) interest on the Bonds,  
if received directly by a Georgia Unitholder, would be exempt from the Georgia  
income tax. Georgia Counsel assumed for purposes of its opinion delivered at    
closing that, at the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions        
relating to the validity thereof and to the exemption of interest thereon from  
federal income tax were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing      
authorities. In addition, Georgia Counsel assumed that, with respect to the     
Georgia Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions that   
interest on the Georgia Bonds is exempt from the Georgia income tax and, with   
respect to the Possession Bonds, bond counsel to the issuing authorities        
rendered opinions that the Possession Bonds and the interest thereon is exempt  
from all state and local income taxation. Neither the Sponsor, nor its counsel, 
nor Georgia counsel has made any review for the Trust of the proceedings        
relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered 
in connection therewith.                                                        

Georgia Counsel rendered its opinion to the Trust at closing that under   
then-existing Georgia law:                                                      

(1)  For Georgia income tax purposes, the Trust is not an association 
         taxable as a corporation, and the income of the Trust will be treated
         as the income of the Unitholders. Interest on the Georgia Bonds which
     is exempt from Georgia income tax when received by the Trust, and
         which would be exempt from Georgia income tax if received directly by
      a Unitholder, will retain its status as a tax-exempt interest when
         distributed by the Trust and received by the Unitholders. Interest on
          the Possession Bonds which is excludable from gross income for federal
   income tax purposes and is exempt from state and local taxation
          pursuant to federal law when received by the Trust will be exempt from
       Georgia income taxation and therefore will not be includible in the
 income of the Unitholder for Georgia income tax purposes when
distributed by the Trust and received by the Unitholders.   

    (2)  If the Trustee disposes of a Bond (whether by sale, exchange, payment
       on maturity, retirement or otherwise) or if a Unitholder redeems or
          sells his Unit, the Unitholder will recognize gain or loss for Georgia
     income tax purposes to the same extent that gain or loss would be
     recognized for federal income tax purposes (except in the case of
          Bonds issued before March 11, 1987 issued with original issue discount
        owned by the Trust in which case gain or loss for Georgia income tax
         purposes may differ from the amount recognized for federal income tax
 purposes because original issue discount on such Bonds may be
    determined by accruing said original issue discount on a ratable
   basis). Due to the amortization of bond premium and other basis
adjustments required by the Code, a Unitholder, under some  
          circumstances, may realize taxable gain when his or her Units are sold
        or redeemed for an amount less than or equal to their original cost.

(3)  Amounts paid under an insurance policy or policies issued to the 
         Trust, if any, with respect to the Bonds in the Trust which represent
          maturing interest on defaulted obligations held by the Trustee will be
      exempt from State income taxes if, and to the same extent as, such
   interest would have been so exempt if paid by the issuer of the
      defaulted obligations provided that, at the time such policies are
 purchased, the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable,
     customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the
     issuer of the obligations, rather than the insurer, will pay debt
service on the obligations.                                 

  (4)  Neither the Bonds nor the Units will be subject to Georgia sales or
use tax.                                                    

  Georgia Counsel did not examine any of the Bonds to be deposited and held in
the Trust or the proceedings for the issuance thereof or the opinions of bond   
counsel with respect thereto, and Georgia Counsel expressed no opinion with     
respect to taxation under any other provisions of Georgia law.                  

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other Georgia tax          
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

Regulated Investment Companies

California Tax Status. Certain Trusts intend to elect and to qualify      
annually as "regulated investment companies" under the federal tax laws. For a  
discussion of the federal tax treatment of income earned on Units of a Trust    
that is a regulated investment company, see "Federal Tax Status--Regulated
Investment Companies" above.                                                    

All terms defined within this subsection "State Trust Risk Factors and Tax
Status--Regulated Investment Companies--California Tax Status" are defined      
solely for purposes of this subsection and not are not defined terms applicable 
to other sections of this prospectus.                                           

  This section summarizes some of the California tax consequences to residents
of the State of California of owning Units of a California Trust (the "Trust")  
treated as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes. Tax  
laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries do not describe 
all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. This summary is based in part on  
the advice of counsel to the Sponsor. The California taxing authorities could   
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section.                        

Unitholders of the Trust that are individuals may exclude from income for 
purposes of the California Personal Income Tax dividends received from the      
Trust that are properly designated by the Trust in a written notice mailed to   
the Unitholders as California exempt-interest dividends. The portion of the     
Trust's dividends designated as California exempt-interest dividends may not    
exceed the amount of interest the Trust receives during its taxable year on     
obligations the interest on which, if held by an individual, is exempt from     
taxation by the State of California, reduced by certain non-deductible          
expenses. The Trust may designate California exempt-interest dividends only if  
the Trust qualifies as a regulated investment company under the Code, and, if   
at the close of each quarter of its taxable year, at least 50 percent of the    
value of the total assets consists of obligations the interest on which when    
held by an individual, is exempt from taxation by the State of California.      
Distributions from the Trust, other than California exempt-interest dividends,  
will generally be subject to the California Personal Income Tax. Please note    
that California exempt-interest dividends received by a Unitholder subject to   
the California Corporation Tax Law may be includible its gross income for       
purposes of determining its California franchise tax and its California income  
tax.                                                                            

  Interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry Units of
the Trust, if the Trust distributes California exempt-interest dividends during 
a year, is not deductible for purposes of the California Personal Income Tax.   

 Neither the Sponsor nor its counsel has independently examined the bonds or
the opinions of bond counsel rendered in connection with the issuance of the    
bonds. Ownership of Units in the Trust may result in other California tax       
consequences to certain taxpayers, and prospective investors should consult     
their tax advisors.                                                             

EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. The Trustee will periodically deduct from the Interest Account and,
to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Principal Account,     
amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the Trusts. The Trustee also may       
withdraw from these Accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to     
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the Trusts.     
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a Trust's assets until   
such time as the Trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate Accounts. All costs and expenses incurred in creating and           
establishing the Trusts, including the cost of the initial preparation,         
printing and execution of the Trust Agreement, legal and accounting expenses,   
advertising and selling expenses, expenses of the Trustee, initial evaluation   
fees and other out-of-pocket expenses have been borne by the Sponsor at no cost 
to the Trusts.                                                                  

 Sponsor, Supervisor, Evaluator and Trustee. The Sponsor and the Supervisor,
which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, will receive the annual fees indicated    
under "Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for     
providing bookkeeping and administrative services and for providing portfolio   
supervisory services for the Trusts. These fees may exceed the actual costs of  
providing these services for a Trust but the total amount received for          
providing these services to all Invesco unit investment trusts will not exceed  
the total cost of providing the services in any calendar year. The Evaluator    
will receive the annual evaluation fee indicated under "Summary of Essential    
Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I for evaluating each Trust's         
portfolio. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee indicated under    
"Summary of Essential Financial Information" in Prospectus Part I (which may be 
reduced as described therein). Part of the Trustee's compensation for its       
services is expected to result from the use of the funds being held in the      
Principal and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses   
and redemptions since these Accounts are non-interest bearing to Unitholders.   
These fees are based on the outstanding principal amount of bonds and Units on  
the Date of Deposit for the first year and as of the close of business on       
January 1 for each year thereafter. The Sponsor's, Supervisor's, Evaluator's    
and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval of the Unitholders by      
amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the category "Services Less 
Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers or, if     
this category is not published, in a comparable category.                       

Miscellaneous Expenses. The following additional charges are or may be    
incurred by the Trusts: (a) fees of the Trustee for extraordinary services, (b) 
expenses of the Trustee (including legal and auditing expenses) and of counsel  
designated by the Sponsor, (c) various governmental charges, (d) expenses and   
costs of any action taken by the Trustee to protect the Trusts and the rights   
and interests of Unitholders, (e) indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,  
liability or expenses incurred by it in the administration of the Trusts        
without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, (f) any        
special custodial fees payable in connection with the sale of any of the bonds  
in a Trust, (g) expenditures incurred in contacting Unitholders upon            
termination of the Trusts and (h) costs incurred to reimburse the Trustee for   
advancing funds to the Trusts to meet scheduled distributions (which costs may  
be adjusted periodically in response to fluctuations in short-term interest     
rates). Each Trust will pay the costs associated with updating its registration 
statement each year. The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable out of  
the Trusts. When such fees and expenses are paid by or owing to the Trustee,    
they are secured by a lien on the portfolio of the applicable Trust. If the     
balances in the Interest and Principal Accounts are insufficient to provide for 
amounts payable by a Trust, the Trustee has the power to sell bonds to pay such 
amounts.

Municipal Bond Risk Factors 

The Trusts include certain types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an
investment in a Trust should be made with an understanding of the               
characteristics of and risks associated with such bonds. The types of bonds     
included in each Trust are described under "Portfolio" in the related           
Prospectus Part I. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any   
way for any default, failure or defect in any of the bonds.                     

General Obligation Bonds and Revenue Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be   
general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing      
power of such entity. All other bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds payable   
from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the 
issuer's power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are secured by the       
issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of        
principal and interest. However, the taxing power of any governmental entity    
may be limited by provisions of state constitutions or laws and an entity's     
credit will depend on many factors. Some such factors are the entity's tax      
base, the extent to which the entity relies on federal or state aid, and other  
factors which are beyond the entity's control. Revenue bonds, on the other      
hand, are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or  
class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise    
tax or other specific revenue source. There are, of course, variations in the   
security of the different bonds in a Trust, both within a particular            
classification and between classifications, depending on numerous factors.      

Housing Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations which derive their 
payments from mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA insured. 
Multi-family housing revenue bonds are payable primarily from mortgage loans to 
housing projects for low to moderate income families. Single family mortgage    
revenue bonds are issued for the purpose of acquiring from originating          
financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on residences located within  
the issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or moderate income. The     
ability of housing issuers to make debt service payments on their obligations   
may be affected by various economic and non-economic factors. Such factors      
include: occupancy levels, adequate rental income in multi-family projects, the 
rate of default on mortgage loans underlying single family issuers and the      
ability of mortgage insurers to pay claims. Mortgage loans are generally        
partially or completely prepaid prior to their final maturities as a result of  
events such as sale of the mortgaged premises, default, condemnation or         
casualty loss. Because these bonds are subject to extraordinary mandatory       
redemption in whole or in part from such prepayments of mortgage loans, a       
substantial portion of such bonds will probably be redeemed prior to their      
scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary call dates. Extraordinary  
mandatory redemption without premium could also result from the failure of the  
originating financial institutions to make mortgage loans in sufficient amounts 
within a specified time period. Additionally, unusually high rates of default   
on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce revenues available for the payment  
of principal of or interest on such mortgage revenue bonds. In each case the    
issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply with applicable requirements and   
bond counsel to such issuer has issued an opinion that the interest on the      
bonds is exempt from federal income tax under existing laws and regulations.    
Certain issuers of housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds   
they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds. In  
connection with the housing bonds held by a Trust, the Sponsor at the Date of   
Deposit is not aware that any of the respective issuers of such bonds are       
actively considering the redemption of such bonds prior to their respective     
stated initial call dates.                                                      

Health Care Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be health care revenue bonds. 
Ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on           
feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and  
expenses. A facility's gross receipts and net income available for debt service 
may be affected by future events and conditions including, among other things,  
demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services     
required, physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities,      
competition with other health care facilities, efforts by insurers and          
governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing state            
rate-setting agencies, expenses, the cost and possible unavailability of        
malpractice insurance, the funding of Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third
party payor programs, government regulation and the termination or restriction  
of governmental financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare,  
Medicaid and other similar third party payor programs. It also may be necessary 
for a hospital or other health care facility to incur substantial capital       
expenditures or increased operating expenses to effect changes in its           
facilities, equipment, personnel and services. Hospitals and other health care  
facilities are additionally subject to claims and legal actions by patients and 
others in the ordinary course of business. There can be no assurance that a     
claim will not exceed the insurance coverage of a health care facility or that  
insurance coverage will be available to a facility.                             

Public Utility and Wholesale Electric Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be  
obligations of public utility issuers, including those selling wholesale and    
retail electric power and gas. General problems of such issuers would include   
the difficulty in financing large construction programs in an inflationary      
period, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays            
attributable to environmental considerations, the difficulty of the capital     
market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in obtaining fuel at           
reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation. In addition, federal,  
state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review       
existing, and impose additional, regulations governing the licensing,           
construction and operation of nuclear power plants, which may adversely affect  
the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds to make payments of          
principal and/or interest on such bonds.                                        

Water and Sewer Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers 
whose revenues are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services.     
Such bonds are generally payable from user fees. The problems of such issuers   
include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population    
decline resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large     
construction programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs and    
delays attributable to environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty  
of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of          
conservation programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.          

Industrial Revenue Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue  
bonds ("IRBs"). IRBs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant 
to which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the      
operator of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers.  
In some cases, a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as    
security for the IRBs. Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely   
dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or 
corporate guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many  
factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the           
particular company or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and       
earnings, regulatory and environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from  
accidents or environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and        
financial deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a  
leveraged buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in    
the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such    
operator's creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the   
rating and/or market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of such a    
restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the 
value of such bonds, even though no actual takeover or other action is ever     
contemplated or effected.                                                       

Lease Obligation Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations that are  
secured by lease payments of a governmental entity (hereinafter called "lease   
obligations"). Lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of       
participation. Although the lease obligations do not constitute general         
obligations of the municipality for which the municipality's taxing power is    
pledged, a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipality's covenant 
to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation.        
However, certain lease obligations contain "nonappropriation" clauses which     
provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future
years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis. A        
governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate     
future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to  
take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its       
budgets and to make the appropriations therefore. A governmental entity's       
failure to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could
result in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured   
thereby. Although "non-appropriation" lease obligations are secured by the      
leased property, disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might  
prove difficult.                                                                

Higher Educations and Public Education Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be 
obligations of issuers which are, or which govern the operation of, schools,    
colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem 
taxes or for higher education systems, from tuition, dormitory revenues, grants 
and endowments. General problems relating to school bonds include litigation    
contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part    
from ad valorem taxes, thereby creating a disparity in educational funds        
available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas. Litigation or  
legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the     
payment of school bonds in the Trusts. General problems relating to college and 
university obligations include the prospect of a declining percentage of the    
population consisting of "college" age individuals, possible inability to raise 
tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs, the          
availability and restrictions on the use of endowments and other funds, the     
uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding, and       
government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues   
or costs of such issuers.                                                       

Airport and Transportation Bonds. Certain of the bonds in certain of the  
Trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues        
derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports,        
bridges, turnpikes, port authorities, convention centers and arenas. The major  
portion of an airport's gross operating income is generally derived from fees   
received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of    
annual payments for leases, occupancy of certain terminal space and service     
fees. Airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the  
airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements. From time to time  
the air transport industry has experienced significant variations in earnings   
and traffic, due to increased competition, excess capacity, increased costs,    
deregulation, traffic constraints, acts of terrorism and other factors, and     
several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties. Similarly,     
payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the  
projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and      
rents from buildings. Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by reduction 
in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance, decreased use 
of a facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, scarcity of   
fuel and reduction or loss of rents.                                            

Waste Disposal Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be obligations which are   
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource     
recovery facilities. Resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid 
waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds 
may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence  
of certain circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or          
condemnation of a project; contracts relating to a project becoming void,       
unenforceable or impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of 
raw materials, operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of  
a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the 
operation of a project; and administrative or judicial actions which render     
contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform 
or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. The Sponsor cannot     
predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds   
in a Trust prior to the stated maturity of the bonds.                           

   Original Issue Discount Bonds. Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at
a market discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on      
discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in a Trust were    
lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of          
comparable rating and type. If such interest rates for newly issued comparable  
bonds increase, the market discount of previously issued bonds will become      
greater, and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline,  
the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced, other things    
being equal. Investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a  
market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market  
premium if interest rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the 
value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds   
purchased at a market premium. In addition, if interest rates rise, the         
prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium Securities and the prepayment       
benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds will be reduced. A bond purchased at 
a market discount and held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total  
return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of   
tax-exempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market
rates. See "Federal Tax Status" in Prospectus Part II. Market discount          
attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence  
in the issue.                                                                   

Zero Coupon Bonds. Certain of the bonds may be "zero coupon" bonds. Zero  
coupon bonds are purchased at a deep discount because the buyer receives only   
the right to receive a final payment at the maturity of the bond and does not   
receive any periodic interest payments. The effect of owning deep discount      
bonds which do not make current interest payments (such as the zero coupon      
bonds) is that a fixed yield is earned not only on the original investment but  
also, in effect, on all discount earned during the life of such obligation.     
This implicit reinvestment of earnings at the same rate eliminates the risk of  
being unable to reinvest the income on such obligation at a rate as high as the 
implicit yield on the discount obligation, but at the same time eliminates the  
holder's ability to reinvest at higher rates in the future. For this reason,    
zero coupon bonds are subject to substantially greater price fluctuations       
during periods of changing market interest rates than are securities of         
comparable quality which pay interest.                                          

  Redemption or Sale Prior to Maturity. Certain of the bonds may be subject to
redemption prior to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund         
provisions, call provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption   
provisions or otherwise. A sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a    
period of time for retirement of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which  
is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the    
issuer. A refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or   
before maturity, by the proceeds of a new debt obligation. In general, call     
provisions are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is  
at a premium over par than when it is at a discount from par. The exercise of   
redemption or call provisions will (except to the extent the proceeds of the    
called bonds are used to pay for Unit redemptions) result in the distribution   
of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest 
distributions; it may also affect the current return on Units of the Trust      
involved. Each Trust portfolio contains a listing of the sinking fund and call  
provisions, if any, with respect to each of the debt obligations. Extraordinary 
optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of     
certain events. Generally, events that may permit the extraordinary optional    
redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include,   
among others: a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable;  
the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project  
for which the proceeds of the bonds were used; an exercise by a local, state or 
federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or         
substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used; 
changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating supplies or    
facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the  
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic; changes in    
law or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of    
the agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to      
finance the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which   
imposes excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not imposed on the date the bonds 
are issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds; 
an administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a          
substantial part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of 
the bonds; an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the  
proceeds of the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be    
applied to redeem bonds; or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the  
bonds resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds. The       
issuer of certain bonds in a Trust may have sold or reserved the right to sell, 
upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to third parties all or any        
portion of its rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption    
provisions of such bonds. In such a case the issuer no longer has the right to  
call the bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third   
party. A third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption       
provisions with respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might   
not have called a bond for redemption had it not sold such rights. The Sponsor  
is unable to predict all of the circumstances which may result in such          
redemption of an issue of bonds. See also the discussion of single family       
mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds above for more information on the call  
provisions of such bonds.                                                       

To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending as of
the Date of Deposit in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected  
to have a material adverse effect upon any of the Trusts.                       

At any time after the Date of Deposit, litigation may be initiated on a   
variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a Trust. Such litigation, as, for   
example, suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds      
under environmental protection statutes, may affect the validity of such bonds  
or the tax-free nature of the interest thereon. While the outcome of litigation 
of such nature can never be entirely predicted, each Trust has received or will 
receive opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authorities of each bond on the 
date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and     
that the interest thereon is exempt from federal income tax. In addition, other 
factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of 
issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds.               

Insurance on the Bonds

Insurance has been obtained by the issuers of certain bonds in the Trusts 
prior to the deposit of such bonds in a Trust, guaranteeing prompt payment of   
interest and principal, when due, in respect of such bonds. See "The
Trusts--Objective and Bond Selection" in the prospectus. The premium for any    
insurance policy or policies obtained by an issuer of bonds has been paid by    
such issuer, and any such policy or policies are non-cancelable and will        
continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the       
Preinsured Bond Insurer remains in business. If the provider of an original     
issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy   
or if the rating assigned to the claims-paying ability of any such insurer      
deteriorates, the Preinsured Bond Insurers have no obligation to insure any     
issue adversely affected by either of the above described events.               

  ACA Financial Guaranty Corporation ("ACA Financial Guaranty"). ACA Financial
Guaranty is organized and domiciled in the State of Maryland. Since December    
2007, ACA Financial Guaranty has not issued any new financial guaranty          
insurance policies and is currently operating as a runoff insurance company.    

On August 8, 2008, ACA Financial Guaranty and counterparties to its       
structured finance products reached an agreement on a restructuring plan for    
ACA Financial Guaranty. The plan, approved by the Maryland Insurance            
Administration, provided for settlement of the structured finance obligations   
and protection for ACA Financial Guaranty's municipal policyholders. The        
settlement required that ACA Financial Guaranty make a $209 million cash        
payment and a distribution of surplus notes. The surplus notes provide the      
former collateralized debt obligation ("CDO") counterparties and certain other  
counterparties with approximately a 95% economic interest in ACA Financial      
Guaranty. ACA Financial Guaranty continues to operate as a runoff insurance     
company and focus on actively monitoring its remaining insured municipal        
obligations.                                                                    

As of September 30, 2012, ACA Financial Guaranty had total admitted assets
of $436.3 million and total liabilities of $328.7 million, resulting in a       
surplus as regards policyholders of $107.6 million.                             

On December 15, 2008, S&P raised the financial strength, financial        
enhancement, and issuer credit ratings on ACA Financial Guaranty to B from CCC, 
with a developing outlook. The upgrade reflected the positive effects of the    
restructuring transaction completed in August 2008 that settled all outstanding 
CDO and reinsurance exposures of the company, including the significantly       
deteriorated CDO of asset-backed securities ("ABS") transactions, eliminating a 
requirement to post a significant amount of collateral to the CDO of ABS        
counterparties. At the same time, S&P also withdrew the ratings at ACA          
Financial Guaranty's request.                                                   

 The information relating to ACA Financial Guaranty contained above has been
furnished by ACA Financial Guaranty or the rating agencies. No representation   
is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the 
existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date     
hereof.                                                                         

  Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Ambac Financial Group, Inc.
("Ambac"), headquartered in New York City, is a holding company incorporated in 
the state of Delaware on April 29, 1991. Ambac's activities are divided into two
business segments: (i) financial guarantee and (ii) financial services. Ambac   
provides financial guarantee insurance for public and structured finance        
obligations through its principal operating subsidiary, Ambac Assurance. As a   
holding company, Ambac is largely dependent on dividends from Ambac Assurance to
pay principal and interest on its indebtedness and to pay its operating         
expenses.                                                                       

On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial     
strength rating to AA from AAA, with negative implications. On June 19, 2008,   
Moody's downgraded Ambac Assurance's insurance financial strength rating from   
Aaa to Aa3, with a negative outlook. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of Ambac   
Assurance's insurance financial strength rating reflects Ambac Assurance's      
overall credit profile in the current environment, including its significantly  
constrained new business prospects, its impaired financial flexibility and      
increased expected and stress loss projections among its mortgage-related risk  
exposures relative to previous estimates. On November 5, 2008, Moody's          
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Aa3  
to Baa1, with a developing outlook, as a result of greater than expected        
mortgage-related losses in the third quarter. On November 19, 2008, S&P lowered 
its insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance to A from AA, with a 
negative outlook. The November 19, 2008 rating action on Ambac Assurance        
reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance's exposures in the U.S. residential    
mortgage sector and particularly the related collateralized debt obligation     
structures have been a source of significant and comparatively                  
greater-than-competitor losses and will continue to expose the company to the   
potential for further adverse loss development. On April 13, 2009, Moody's      
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance from Baa1 
to Ba3, with a developing outlook, reflecting Ambac Assurance's weakened        
business position and very constrained financial flexibility, as well as its    
weakened risk adjusted capitalization, as Moody's loss estimates on residential 
mortgage-backed securities ("RMBS") have increased significantly. In Moody's    
view, these higher loss estimates increase the estimated capital required to    
support Ambac Assurance's sizable direct RMBS portfolio (including securities   
owned as well as securities guaranteed) and also the insurer's large portfolio  
of ABS CDO risks. On June 24, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,        
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to BBB 
from A with negative implications. The June 24, 2009 rating action on Ambac     
Assurance reflects S&P's view that Ambac Assurance is effectively in runoff and 
the likelihood of the company continuing as an operating entity capable of      
writing new business has decreased significantly. On July 28, 2009, S&P lowered 
the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings  
of Ambac Assurance to CC from BBB, with a developing outlook. The July 28, 2009 
rating action on Ambac Assurance reflects S&P's view of the significant         
deterioration in the Ambac Assurance's insured portfolio of nonprime RMBS and   
related CDOs, which has required the company to strengthen reserves to account  
for higher projected claims. In S&P's view, the additional reserves will have a 
significant negative effect on operating results, which will likely cause       
surplus to decline to below regulator required minimums. On July 29, 2009,      
Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Ambac Assurance   
from Ba3 to Caa2, with a developing outlook, reflecting Moody's belief that, as 
a result of Ambac Assurance's recently announced large loss reserve increase and
credit impairment charge estimated for the second quarter of 2009 which would   
reduce Ambac Assurance's regulatory capital to levels below the required minimum
threshold, there will be increased pressure on Ambac Assurance's counterparties 
to commute outstanding exposures on terms that could imply a distressed         
exchange. On March 25, 2010, S&P revised the counterparty credit, financial     
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac Assurance to R from CC (an 
issuer rated "R" by S&P is under regulatory supervision because of its financial
condition). S&P's March 25, 2010 rating action resulted following a directive by
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac Assurance to   
establish a segregated account for certain insured exposure, primarily policies 
related to credit derivatives, RMBS, and other structured finance transactions. 
On March 26, 2010, Moody's placed the Caa2 insurance financial strength rating  
of Ambac Assurance on review for possible upgrade. On November 23, 2010, Moody's
affirmed Ambac's Caa2 insurance financial strength rating, with a developing    
outlook. On November 30, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty credit, financial  
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of Ambac at the company's request.  
The November 30, 2010 rating action followed a directive by the Commissioner of 
Insurance of the State of Wisconsin to Ambac to establish a segregated account  
for certain insured exposure, primarily policies related to credit derivatives, 
residential mortgage-backed securities, and other structured finance            
transactions. On April 7, 2011, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial        
strength rating of Ambac Assurance.                                             

 There have been a number of developments with respect to ratings actions by
the rating agencies. As a result of these rating agency actions, as well as     
investor concern with respect to these actions, Ambac Assurance and its         
operating subsidiaries have been able to originate only a de minimis amount of  
new financial guarantee business since November 2007, and no new business in    
2009. As a result, Ambac is no longer competing for new business.               

On March 25, 2010, Ambac announced that, at the direction of the Office of
the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Wisconsin ("OCI"), Ambac          
Assurance had established a segregated account for certain of its liabilities,  
primarily policies related to credit derivatives, RMBS and other structured     
finance transactions. This action derives from the OCI's view that immediate    
action is necessary to address Ambac Assurance's financial position. In         
conjunction with the establishment of the segregated account, the OCI has       
commenced rehabilitation proceedings with respect to liabilities contained in   
the segregated account in order to facilitate an orderly run-off and/or         
settlement of those specific liabilities. On June 7, 2010 Ambac announced that  
it had commuted all of its remaining CDOs of ABS and that certain other non-CDO 
of ABS exposures would be commuted within the next twelve months.               

On November 8, 2010, Ambac announced that it has filed for a voluntary    
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the  
"Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern       
District of New York (the "Bankruptcy Court"). Ambac will continue to operate   
in the ordinary course of business as "debtor-in-possession" under the          
jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable      
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Ambac 
Assurance is subject to insurance regulatory requirements of the States of      
Wisconsin and New York, and the other jurisdictions in which it is licensed to  
conduct business.                                                               

Ambac Assurance's statutory policyholder surplus and qualified statutory  
capital were $100.0 million and $628.3 million at September 30, 2012,           
respectively as compared to $495.3 million and $684.6 million as of December
31, 2011, respectively. As of September 30, 2012, total stockholders' deficit   
was $3.49 billion; at December 31, 2011, total stockholders' deficit was $3.15  
billion. This increased deficit was primarily caused by the net loss for the    
nine months ended September 30, 2012, partially offset by unrealized gains on   
investment securities during the period.

existence of any adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date

Assured Guaranty Corp. ("Assured Guaranty") and Assured Guaranty Municipal
Corp. ("Assured Municipal") (formerly Financial Security Assurance Inc.         
("FSA")). Assured Guaranty, a subsidiary of Assured Guaranty Ltd. ("Assured"),  
is organized in the State of Maryland and provides financial guaranty insurance 
to both the municipal and structured finance sectors. Assured Municipal, also a 
subsidiary of Assured, is a separately capitalized company organized in the     
State of New York and provides municipal bond insurance.                        

  In January 2009, Assured Guaranty finalized an agreement with CIFG Assurance
North America, Inc. to assume a diversified portfolio of financial guaranty     
contracts totaling approximately $13.3 billion of net par outstanding. Assured  
Guaranty received $75.6 million, which included $85.7 million of upfront        
premiums net of ceding commissions and approximately $12.2 million of future    
installments related to this transaction.                                       

On July 1, 2009, Assured completed the purchase of Financial Security     
Assurance Holdings Ltd., the parent of financial guaranty insurance company,    
FSA, from Dexia Holdings Inc. Effective November 9, 2009, FSA was renamed       
Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. In certain states, Assured Guaranty Municipal  
Corp. may operate under its prior name, Financial Security Assurance Inc.       

On June 24, 2010, S&P published a Full Analysis in which it affirmed its  
"AAA" financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal,     
reflecting S&P's view of the companies' dominant market position in the bond    
insurance industry and their strong combined capital position. On October 25,
2010, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA+ from AAA, with a stable outlook.  
The downgrades reflect S&P's view of a struggling financial guarantee market,   
each company's weak statutory operating performance, and also the quality of    
each company's capital within S&P's capital adequacy analysis. On November 30,
2011 S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both 
Assured Guaranty and Assured Municipal to AA- from AA+, with a stable outlook.  
The November 30, 2011 downgrades reflect S&P's view that Assured Guaranty and   
Assured Municipal do not maintain enough capital to mitigate the largest obligor
concentrations for a higher rating. On March 18, 2014 S&P raised the            
counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and 
Assured Municipal to AA from AA-, with a stable outlook. The March 18, 2014     
upgrade reflects S&P's view that the competitive position of Assured Guaranty   
and Assured Municipal remains strong relative to its peers' in the bond         
insurance industry.                                                             

On November 21, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength 
rating of Assured Guaranty from Aaa to Aa2, primarily reflecting Moody's        
updated view on Assured Guaranty's exposure to weakness inherent in the         
financial guaranty business model. Also on November 21, 2008, Moody's           
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FSA from Aaa to Aa3,      
reflecting Moody's view of FSA's diminished business and financial profile      
resulting from its exposure to losses on U.S. mortgage risks and disruption in  
the financial guaranty business more broadly. On November 12, 2009, Moody's     
downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Assured Guaranty from Aa2 
to Aa3, with a negative outlook. Moody's November 12, 2009 downgrade results    
from Moody's review of the performance of Assured's RMBS exposures. Moody's     
said that adverse trends in RMBS loss estimates have had varying effects on     
Assured's main insurance subsidiaries. On March 5, 2010, Moody's confirmed the  
insurance financial strength ratings of both Assured Guaranty and Assured       
Municipal at Aa3, with a negative outlook. On January 17, 2013, Moody's         
downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of Assured Guaranty to A3   
from Aa3 and of Assured Municipal to A2 from Aa3, both with a stable outlook.   
The January 17, 2013 downgrade reflects Moody's reassessment of the business    
franchise, expected future profitability and financial flexibility of Assured   
Guaranty and Assured Municipal.                                                 

Assured's third quarter 2012 net income declined to $142 million from $761
million in third quarter 2011 due primarily to the effects of changes in credit 
spreads on the fair value of credit derivatives, offset in part by a decline in 
loss expense, which was significantly higher in the prior year due mainly to    
the effects of declining discount rates in the third quarter of 2011. Non-GAAP  
operating income in third quarter 2012 was $166 million, an increase from       
operating income in third quarter 2011, due primarily to higher net earned      
premiums due to refundings, accelerations and terminations, lower loss expense, 
and a lower effective tax rate on operating income. As of September 30, 2012,   
Assured Guaranty had total assets of $5.28 billion and total liabilities of     
$4.13 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of $1.15 billion. As of    
September 30, 2012, Assured Municipal had total assets of $10.74 billion and    
total liabilities of $7.64 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of    
$3.10 billion.                                                                  

The information contained above relating to Assured Guaranty and Assured  
Municipal and their parent company, Assured, is based upon publicly available   
information, or upon information that has been provided by the ratings          
agencies. No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of    
such information, or as to the existence of any adverse changes in such         
information subsequent to the date hereof.                                      

On April 1, 2015, Assured Guaranty acquired all issued and outstanding    
shares of Radian Asset Assurance, Inc. All prior obligations of Radian Asset    
are now obligations of Assured Guaranty.                                        

  Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp ("BHAC"). BHAC is a bond insurance company
created by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. ("Berkshire") in December 2007 and is       
licensed to write financial guarantee insurance in 49 states.                   

  On April 11, 2008, S&P assigned an initial rating of AAA to BHAC's insurance
financial strength, with a stable outlook. On April 25, 2008, Moody's assigned  
an initial rating of Aaa to BHAC's insurance financial strength, with a stable  
outlook. On April 8, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength  
rating of BHAC from Aaa to Aa1, with a stable outlook. This downgrade reflects  
Moody's view concerning "the impact on Berkshire's key businesses of the severe 
decline in equity markets over the past year as well as the protracted economic 
recession." Moody's noted that Berkshire is also exposed to heightened          
volatility in its earnings and capital base related to market value fluctuations
within its large portfolio of equity derivatives. On February 4, 2010, S&P      
lowered the financial strength rating of BHAC from AAA to AA+, with a stable    
outlook. The February 4, 2010 rating action was taken in anticipation of        
Berkshire's acquisition of Northern Santa Fe Corporation reflecting S&P's       
expectation that a significant part of the internal cash for the acquisition    
will come from Berkshire's core insurance operations and that Berkshire's       
overall capital adequacy has weakened to levels no longer consistent with a AAA 
rating and is not expected to return to extremely strong levels in the near     
term. On August 11, 2015, S&P placed the AA+ financial strength rating of BHAC  
on CreditWatch Negative. This action follows Berkshire Hathaway's announcement  
of an agreement to acquire the debt of Precision Castparts Corp and reflects    
uncertainty surrounding the funding of the acquisition and its effect on cash   
resources and leverage at the holding-company level.                            

As of September 30, 2012, Berkshire had total assets of $424.1 billion and
total liabilities of $235.0 billion, resulting in total shareholder equity of   
$189.1 billion.                                                                 

  The information relating to BHAC and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by BHAC or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as   
to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any  
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.              

 Build America Mutual Assurance Company ("BAM"). BAM is a New York domiciled
mutual insurance company owned by the issuers of municipal bonds who use BAM to 
insure their debt obligations. BAM officially launched on July 23, 2012 and     
began writing policies in September of 2012.                                    

On July 23, 2012, S&P assigned an initial rating of AA to BAM's financial 
strength and counterparty credit ratings, with a stable outlook. These ratings  
based upon S&P's view that BAM holds a very strong competitive position with    
low industry risk, along with extremely strong capital adequacy and strong      
operating performance.                                                          

  As of September 30, 2012 BAM had total net admitted assets of $518.9 million
and total liabilities of $27.9 million, resulting in a surplus as regards       
policyholders of $491.0 million.                                                

  The information relating to BAM contained above has been furnished by BAM or
the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or     
adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any adverse changes in  
such information subsequent to the date hereof.                                 

CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. ("CIFG"). CIFG Holding, Inc. is the    
holding company for the CIFG group of financial guaranty insurance and          
reinsurance companies ("CIFG Group"), including CIFG Assurance North America,   
Inc., a New York corporation and its subsidiaries. The CIFG Group is actively   
managing the runoff of a portfolio of insured structured finance, municipal and 
infrastructure risks. On September 29, 2010, CIFG and CIFG Guaranty entered     
into a merger agreement which resulted in CIFG Guaranty merging into CIFG       
(together with related transactions, the "CIFG Merger").                        

   On March 6, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of CIFG from Aaa to A1, with a stable outlook. This rating action reflected     
Moody's assessment of CIFG's weakened capitalization, impaired business         
opportunities, and uncertain strategic direction, as a result, in part, of its  
exposures to the U.S. residential mortgage market. Moody's believed that CIFG's 
significant exposure to the mortgage sector, especially ABS CDOs is indicative  
of a risk posture far greater than would be consistent with a Aaa rating going  
forward. On May 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength   
ratings of CIFG to Ba2 from A1, with direction uncertain, reflecting the high   
likelihood that, absent material developments, the company would fail minimum   
regulatory capital requirements in New York and Bermuda due to expected         
significant increases in modeled loss reserves on ABS CDOs. In Moody's view, the
breach of such regulatory capital requirements would put the company in a       
precarious position, especially in light of the solvency provisions embedded in 
its CDS exposures. On October 28, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance        
financial strength rating of CIFG from Ba2 to B3, with direction uncertain,     
reflecting Moody's expectation of substantially higher mortgage-related losses  
arising from CIFG's insured portfolio, as well as the possibility that certain  
troubled exposures could be commuted. On January 22, 2009, Moody's upgraded the 
insurance financial strength rating of CIFG from B3 to Ba3, with a developing   
outlook, reflecting the strengthened capital adequacy profile of CIFG following 
its restructuring and the commutation of substantially all of its ABS CDO risks.
Also on January 22, 2009, S&P raised the insurance financial strength rating of 
CIFG to BB from B, with a developing outlook. S&P's January 22, 2009 upgrade    
results from the completion of CIFG's restructuring plan involving key          
policyholders, creditors, and equity owners (counterparties) who had hedged     
their ABS CDO and commercial real estate CDO exposures with CIFG and which were 
significantly affected by defaults and downgrades of the underlying collateral. 
On June 15, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and  
financial enhancement ratings of CIFG to CC from BB, with a negative outlook,   
reflecting S&P's view of the significant deterioration in the company's insured 
portfolio of nonprime RMBS which has necessitated that CIFG strengthen reserves 
to account for the higher projected claims. On August 20, 2009, Moody's         
downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings of CIFG from Ba3to Caa2,    
resulting from significant deterioration in the company's remaining insured     
portfolio since January, 2009 when CIFG initiated a broad restructuring. On     
November 11, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings  
of CIFG from Caa2 to Ca. Also on November 11, 2009, Moody's announced that it   
will withdraw the insurance financial strength rating of CIFG. The November 11,
2009 rating actions reflect Moody's view that material deterioration in CIFG's  
insured portfolio adversely affected the guarantor's capital adequacy profile   
and Moody's believes that CIFG may no longer have sufficient financial resources
to pay all insurance claims. On February 16, 2010, S&P withdrew the counterparty
credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of CIFG.          

  As of September 30, 2012, CIFG had net admitted assets of $742.3 million and
total liabilities of $385.5 million. CIFG's statutory surplus as of September
30, 2012 is approximately $356.7 million, a decrease of approximately $227.8    
million from approximately $584.5 million at December 31, 2011. This decrease   
is primarily attributable to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense reserves 
established for student loans of approximately $252.3 million, which is         
partially offset by other income statement balances resulting in a net loss of  
approximately $227.0 million and an increase in contingency reserves of         
approximately $3.5 million.                                                     

  The information relating to CIFG and its affiliates contained above has been
furnished by CIFG or the rating agencies. No representation is made herein as   
to the accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any  
adverse changes in such information subsequent to the date hereof.              

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("FGIC"). FGIC is a wholly owned     
subsidiary of FGIC Corporation. The company was engaged in the business of      
providing financial guaranty insurance and other forms of credit enhancement    
for public finance and structured finance obligations. In January 2008, FGIC    
voluntarily ceased writing financial guaranty policies concerning new or        
additional risks.                                                               

The deterioration in the U.S. housing and mortgage markets and the global 
credit markets, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2007 and continued   
through the fourth quarter of 2009, has adversely affected the company's        
business, results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, the      
company incurred significant losses related to its exposure to certain ABS CDOs,
which are backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and to certain RMBS, primarily     
backed by first-lien or second-lien mortgages. These losses have resulted in a  
substantial reduction of FGIC's statutory policyholders' surplus over time. On  
November 24, 2009, the New York State Insurance Department, the predecessor to  
the New York State Department of Financial Services, issued an order pursuant to
Section 1310 of the New York Insurance Law requiring FGIC to, among other       
things, suspend paying any and all claims. FGIC was subsequently unable to      
eliminate the impairment of its policyholders' surplus through an out-of-court  
Surplus Restoration Plan. On June 11, 2012, Benjamin M. Lawsky, Superintendent  
of Financial Services of the State of New York (the "Superintendent") filed a   
verified petition with the Supreme Court of the State of New York for an order  
of rehabilitation (i) appointing the Superintendent as rehabilitator            
("Rehabilitator") of FGIC, (ii) directing the Rehabilitator to take possession  
of the property and assets of FGIC and to conduct the business thereof, and     
(iii) directing the Rehabilitator to take steps towards the removal of the      
causes and conditions which have made FGIC's rehabilitation proceeding (the     
"Rehabilitation Proceeding") necessary. FGIC consented to the commencement of   
the Rehabilitation Proceeding.                                                  

Prior to the fourth quarter of 2007, FGIC's financial strength was rated  
"Aaa" by Moody's "AAA" by S&P, and "AAA" by Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch").      
Moody's, S&P and Fitch have since completed several assessments of FGIC's       
capital adequacy in relation to the company's exposure to ABS CDOs which are    
backed primarily by subprime RMBS, and its exposure to first-lien and           
second-lien RMBS. As a result of these assessments, Moody's, S&P and Fitch      
downgraded the financial strength ratings of FGIC. As of March 31, 2008, Fitch  
had downgraded FGIC from AA to BBB with Rating Watch Negative; Moody's had      
downgraded FGIC from A3 to Baa3; and S&P had downgraded FGIC from A to BB. On   
June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of    
FGIC from Baa3 to B1, reflecting FGIC's severely impaired financial flexibility 
and proximity to minimum regulatory capital requirements relative to Moody's    
estimates of expected case losses. On November 24, 2008, S&P lowered its        
insurance financial strength rating of FGIC to CCC from BB, with a negative     
outlook. S&P's November 24, 2008 downgrade results from FGIC's exposure to      
nonprime and second-lien mortgages and related CDO of ABS. On December 19,
2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of FGIC from   
B1 to Caa1, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation of higher   
mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio and the           
constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of the holding company. On      
March 24, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of   
FGIC from Caa1 to Caa3, with a negative outlook, reflecting Moody's expectation 
of higher mortgage-related losses arising from FGIC's insured portfolio,        
insufficient claims paying resources to cover Moody's estimate of expected      
loss, and the constrained liquidity and financial flexibility of FGIC's holding 
company. Also on March 24, 2009, Moody's withdrew the insurance financial       
strength rating of FGIC. On April 22, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty        
credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of FGIC to CC     
from CCC, with a negative outlook. Also on April 22, 2009, S&P withdrew the     
ratings on FGIC and the counterparty credit rating on the holding company, FGIC 
Corporation, because of S&P's expectation that timely and comprehensive         
financial information will no longer be available.                              

  As of September 30, 2012, FGIC had net admitted assets of approximately $2.1
billion and total liabilities of approximately $5.8 billion.                    

 On August 4, 2010, FGIC Corporation announced that it had filed a voluntary
petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in    
the Southern District of New York. None of FGIC Corporation's subsidiaries or   
affiliates, including FGIC, are part of the Chapter 11 filing.

Municipal Assurance Corporation ("MAC"). MAC is a New York domiciled      
corporation providing municipal bond insurance for municipal and infrastructure 
bonds. MAC currently guarantees only public finance transactions. MAC is an     
Assured Guaranty company owned jointly by its affiliates Assured Guaranty       
Municipal Corp. and Assured Guaranty Corp. MAC is part of the Assured Guaranty  
Group.                                                                          

On July 17, 2013, S&P assigned MAC a long-term financial strength and     
counterparty credit rating of AA- to MAC with a stable outlook. On March 18,
2014, S&P raised its financial strength and enhancement rating on MAC from AA-  
to AA. The rating action reflects S&P's view that MAC's competitive position    
remains strong relative to its peers' in the bond industry. S&P continues to    
view MAC as having a stable outlook.

National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation ("National Guarantee")      
(formerly MBIA Insurance Corp. of Illinois ("MBIA Illinois")). MBIA, Inc., a    
Connecticut corporation, conducts its financial guarantee business through      
though its wholly-owned subsidiaries MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA Corp."), 
which writes global structured finance and non-U.S. public finance financial    
guarantee insurance, and National Guarantee, which writes U.S. public finance   
guarantees.                                                                     

On February 18, 2009, MBIA, Inc., the parent company of MBIA Corp.,       
announced the restructuring of its financial guaranty insurance operations      
following the approval of the New York and Illinois insurance regulators. The   
restructuring involved the segregation of its financial guaranty insurance      
operations into two separately capitalized sister companies, with National      
Guarantee assuming the risk associated with its U.S. municipal exposures, and   
with MBIA Corp. insuring the remainder of the portfolio, including all          
international and structured finance exposures. Business ceded to MBIA Corp.    
from FGIC in 2008 has been assigned to National Guarantee. To provide           
additional protection for its municipal bond policyholders, National Guarantee  
has also issued second-to-pay policies for the benefit of the policyholders     
covered by the reinsurance and assignment. The second-to-pay policies, which    
are a direct obligation of National Guarantee, will be held by The Bank of New  
York Mellon as insurance trustee. These policies provide that if MBIA Corp. or  
FGIC, as applicable, do not pay valid claims of their policyholders, the        
policyholders will then be able to make a claim directly against National       
Guarantee under the second-to-pay policies. On March 19, 2009, MBIA Illinois    
formally changed its name to National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation.     
Effective December 1, 2009, National Guarantee was redomesticated to the State  
of New York and is subject to insurance regulations and supervision of the      
State of New York. National Guarantee is a wholly owned subsidiary of MBIA,     
Inc. and independently capitalized with $5.6 billion in claims-paying resources 
as of December 31, 2010. In certain states, National Public Finance Guarantee   
Corporation may operate under its prior name, MBIA Insurance Corp. of           
Illinois.                                                                       

On June 5, 2008, S&P downgraded MBIA Corp.'s insurance financial strength 
rating to AA from AAA. On June 19, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance       
financial strength ratings of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from Aaa  
to A2. Moody's June 19, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its insurance          
affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s limited financial flexibility and impaired     
franchise, as well as the substantial risk within its portfolio of insured      
exposures and a movement toward more aggressive capital management within the   
group. On November 7, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength 
rating of MBIA Corp. and its insurance affiliates from A2 to Baa1, with a       
developing outlook. Moody's November 7, 2008 downgrade of MBIA Corp. and its    
insurance affiliates reflects MBIA Corp.'s diminished business and financial    
profile resulting from its exposure to losses from U.S. mortgage risks and      
disruption in the financial guaranty business more broadly. On February 18,
2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp.  
from Baa1 to B3, with a developing outlook, reflecting MBIA Corp.'s substantial 
reduction in claims-paying resources relative to the remaining higher-risk      
exposures in its insured portfolio, given the removal of capital, and the       
transfer of unearned premium reserves associated with the ceding of its         
municipal portfolio to MBIA Illinois, as well as the continued deterioration of 
MBIA Corp.'s insured portfolio of largely structured credits, with stress       
reaching sectors beyond residential mortgage-related securities. Also on        
February 18, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and 
financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB+ from AA, with a negative    
outlook. The February 18, 2009 rating action on MBIA Corp. reflects S&P's view  
that MBIA Corp.'s retained insured portfolio lacks sufficient sector diversity  
and with time could become more concentrated, and that MBIA Corp.'s 2005--2007  
vintage direct RMBS, CDO of ABS, and other structured exposures are subject to  
continued adverse loss development that could erode capital adequacy. At the    
same time, S&P lowered the counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of
MBIA Illinois to AA- from AA, reflecting MBIA Illinois's uncertain business     
prospects and capital. On June 5, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit,    
financial strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BBB from 
BBB+, with a negative outlook, resulting from MBIA Corp.'s increased loss       
assumptions on its 2005--2007 vintage direct RMBS and CDO of ABS and a change in
the assumed tax benefit of tax-loss carryforwards. Also on June 5, 2009, S&P    
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement  
ratings of National Guarantee to A from AA-, with a negative outlook, reflecting
S&P's view of National Guarantee's uncertain business and capital-raising       
prospects. On September 28, 2009, S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial
strength, and financial enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to BB+ from BBB, with 
a negative outlook, reflecting S&P's view that macroeconomic conditions continue
to contribute to losses on the group's structured finance products. On December
22, 2010 S&P lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial 
enhancement ratings of MBIA Corp. to B from BB+, with a negative outlook,       
reflecting increased stress case loss projections. Also on December 22, 2010 S&P
lowered the counterparty credit, financial strength, and financial enhancement  
ratings of National Guarantee to BBB from A, with a developing outlook. On      
December 19, 2011 Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of 
National Guarantee from Baa1 to Baa2, with a negative outlook, based upon       
weakening of the overall MBIA group's market standing as losses grow at National
Guarantee's affiliated companies and the risk that resources at National        
Guarantee could be drawn away to support losses elsewhere within the group. On  
May 10, 2013 S&P raised the counterparty credit, financial strength, and        
financial enhancement ratings of National Guarantee to A from BB, with a stable 
outlook. The May 10, 2013 rating action reflects S&P's view that MBIA Corp. no  
longer acts as an anchor on the National Guarantee rating following the         
settlement with Societe Generale that ends litigation challenging National      
Guarantee's split from MBIA Corp. in 2009. On May 21, 2013 Moody's upgraded the 
insurance financial strength rating of MBIA Corp. to B3 from Caa2, with a       
positive outlook, citing MBIA Corp.'s improved capital and liquidity profile    
following settlements of putback receivables and insured claims with major      
counterparties. Also on May 21, 2013 Moody's upgraded the insurance financial   
strength rating of National Guarantee to Baa1 from Baa2, with a positive        
outlook. The May 21, 2013 rating action reflects National Guarantee's improved  
credit profile following the repayment of the loan from its weaker affiliate,   
MBIA Corp., and the termination of the litigation related to the 2009           
restructuring. On March 18, 2014 S&P raised the counterparty credit, financial  
strength and financial enhancement ratings of National Guarantee to AA-from A,  
with a stable outlook. The March 18, 2014 upgrade reflects S&P's view that      
National Guarantee's prospective strong business risk profile and strong        
financial risk profile, based on the belief that the company will have a strong 
competitive position and strong operating performance, as well as its current   
extremely strong capital adequacy position.                                     

As of September 30, 2012, National Guarantee had total net admitted assets
of $5.9 billion and total liabilities of $4.1 billion, resulting in a surplus   
as regard policyholders of $1.8 billion.                                        

As of September 30, 2012, MBIA, Inc. and its subsidiaries had total assets
of $22.1 billion and total liabilities of $19.6 billion. MBIA, Inc.'s total     
shareholders' equity as of September 30, 2012 was $2.6 billion, increasing from 
$1.7 billion as of December 31, 2011.                                           

  The information relating to MBIA and its affiliates contained above has been

 Syncora Guarantee Inc. ("Syncora Guarantee") (formerly XL Capital Assurance
Inc. ("XLCA")). Syncora Guarantee, a wholly owned subsidiary of Syncora         
Holdings Ltd. ("Syncora Holdings"), is a New York domiciled financial guarantee 
insurance company which provides credit enhancement and protection products to  
the public finance and structured finance markets throughout the United States  
and internationally.                                                            

   In February 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength ratings
of XLCA to A3 from Aaa. On June 20, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance      
financial strength rating of XLCA from A3 to B2, reflecting XLCA's severely     
impaired financial flexibility and proximity to minimum regulatory capital      
requirements relative to Moody's estimates of expected case losses. On October
24, 2008, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of Syncora 
Guarantee from B2 to Caa1. On November 18, 2008, S&P lowered its insurance      
financial strength rating of Syncora Guarantee to B from BBB- with developing   
expectations. S&P's November 18, 2008 downgrade resulted from the Syncora       
Guarantee's delay in implementing its restructuring plan and slow progress in   
its negotiations with counterparties of its CDO of ABS exposure. On January 29,
2009, S&P lowered the issuer credit and financial strength ratings of Syncora   
Guarantee to CC from B, with a negative outlook. S&P's January 29, 2009         
downgrade resulted from S&P's recent update to its distressed exchange criteria.
On March 9, 2009, Moody's downgraded the insurance financial strength rating of 
Syncora Guarantee from Caa1 to Ca, with a developing outlook, as a result of the
large loss reserve and credit impairment charges taken by Syncora Guarantee on  
its mortgage-related exposures during the fourth quarter, which have resulted in
a $2.4 billion statutory deficit at Syncora Guarantee as of December 31, 2008.  
On April 27, 2009, S&P revised the financial strength and financial enhancement 
ratings of Syncora Guarantee to R from CC (an issuer rated "R" by S&P is under  
regulatory supervision because of its financial condition). Also on April 27,
2009, S&P revised the counterparty credit rating of Syncora Guarantee to D from 
CC (an issuer rated "D" by S&P has failed to pay one or more of its financial   
obligation when it became due). S&P's April 27, 2009 rating actions resulted    
from Syncora Guarantee's announcement that pursuant to an order of the New York 
Insurance Department ("NYID"), the company must suspend any and all claims      
payments until it has restored its policyholders' surplus to a level greater    
than or equal to $65 million, the minimum the state requires. On July 28, 2010, 
S&P withdrew the D counterparty credit rating and the R financial strength and  
financial enhancement ratings of Syncora Guarantee. S&P's July 28, 2010 ratings 
actions resulted from S&P's belief that there is not sufficient information to  
judge Syncora Guarantee's claims paying ability.                                

As of September 30, 2012, Syncora Guarantee had total assets of $1.17     
billion and total liabilities of $639 million, resulting in a policyholders'    
surplus of $504.2 million.                                                      

On July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced that Syncora Guarantee has   
completed its remediation plan sufficient to meet its minimum statutory         
policyholder surplus requirements and address previously announced short and    
medium term liquidity issues. Also on July 20, 2010, Syncora Holdings announced 
that the NYID had approved Syncora Guarantee's plan for the payment of accrued  
and unpaid claims and for the payment of new claims as they become due in the   
ordinary course of business, resulting in the recommencement of claim payments  
by Syncora Guaranty on regularly scheduled payment dates occurring on or after  
July 21, 2010.

subsequent to the date hereof.                                                  

The public can read and copy any materials the above referenced companies 
file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference in Washington, D.C. You may

The extent of state insurance regulation and supervision varies by        
jurisdiction, but New York and most other jurisdictions have laws and           
regulations prescribing permitted investments and governing the payment of      
dividends, transactions with affiliates, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions  
or sales of assets and incurrence of liabilities for borrowings.                

In order to be in an Insured Trust, bonds must be insured by one of the   
Preinsured Bond Insurers. In determining eligibility for insurance, the         
Preinsured Bond Insurers have applied their own standards which correspond      
generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability   
of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria     
used in the selection of bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the standards of   
the Preinsured Bond Insurers are more restrictive than those of the Sponsor,    
the previously stated Trust investment criteria have been limited with respect  
to the bonds. This decision is made prior to the Date of Deposit, as debt       
obligations not eligible for insurance are not deposited in an Insured Trust.   
Thus, all of the bonds in the portfolios of the Insured Trusts are insured by   
the issuer of the bonds prior to the deposit of such bonds in a Trust.          

  Preinsured Bonds in an Insured Trust may or may not have a higher yield than
comparably uninsured bonds. In selecting such bonds for an Insured Trust, the   
Sponsor has applied the criteria described under "The Trusts--Objectives and
Bond Selection".                                                                

  In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in respect of
a bond, a Preinsured Bond Insurer shall make such payment after the respective  
insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened    
(but not earlier than the date such payment is due). The Preinsured Bond        
Insurer, as regards any payment it may make, will succeed to the rights of the  
Trustee in respect thereof. All policies issued by the Preinsured Bond          
Insurers, if any, are substantially identical insofar as obligations to an      
Insured Trust are concerned.                                                    

The Internal Revenue Service has issued a letter ruling which holds in    
effect that insurance proceeds representing maturing interest on defaulted      
municipal obligations paid to holders of insured bonds, under policy provisions 
substantially identical to the policies described herein, will be excludable    
from federal gross income under Section 103(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code  
to the same extent as if such payments were made by the issuer of the municipal 
obligations. Holders of Units in an Insured Trust should discuss with their tax 
advisers the degree of reliance which they may place on this letter ruling.     
However, counsel for the Sponsor at the time of the closing of the Insured      
Trust, had given an opinion to the effect such payment of proceeds would be     
excludable from federal gross income to the extent described under "Federal Tax
Status" in Prospectus Part II.                                                  

The information relating to each Preinsured Bond Insurer, if any, has been
furnished by such companies. The financial information with respect to each     
Preinsured Bond Insurer appears in reports filed with state insurance           
regulatory authorities and is subject to audit and review by such authorities.  
No representation is made herein as to the accuracy or adequacy of such         
information or as to the absence of material adverse changes in such            
information subsequent to the dates thereof.                                    

Portfolio Administration

The Trustee is empowered to sell, for the purpose of redeeming Units      
tendered by any Unitholder, and for the payment of expenses for which funds may 
not be available, such of the bonds designated by the Supervisor as the Trustee 
in its sole discretion may deem necessary. The Supervisor, in designating such  
bonds, will consider a variety of factors including (a) interest rates, (b)     
market value and (c) marketability. The Sponsor may direct the Trustee to       
dispose of bonds if the supervisor determines there exists any default in       
payment of principal or interest, institution of certain legal proceedings,     
default under other documents adversely affecting debt service, default in      
payment of principal or interest or other obligations of the same issuer,       
decline in projected income pledged for debt service on revenue bonds or        
decline in price or the occurrence of other market or credit factors, including 
advance refunding (i.e., the issuance of refunding securities and the deposit   
of the proceeds thereof in trust or escrow to retire the refunded securities on 
their respective redemption dates), so that in the opinion of the Supervisor    
the retention of such bonds would be detrimental to the interest of the         
Unitholders. In connection with the Insured Trusts to the extent that bonds are 
sold which are current in payment of principal and interest in order to meet    
redemption requests and defaulted bonds are retained in the portfolio in order  
to preserve the related insurance protection applicable to said bonds, the      
overall quality of the bonds remaining in such Trust's portfolio will tend to   
diminish. The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated, to direct the Trustee to 
dispose of bonds in the event of an advanced refunding.                         

 The Sponsor is required to instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by
an issuer of any of the bonds to issue new obligations in exchange or           
substitution for any bond pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan, except   
that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept or reject such an offer or  
to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem proper if 
(1) the issuer is in default with respect to such bond or (2) in the written    
opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default with respect to such    
bond in the reasonably foreseeable future. Any obligation so received in        
exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject to the terms and   
conditions of the Trust Agreement to the same extent as bonds originally        
deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of obligations in      
exchange or substitution for underlying bonds, the Trustee is required to give  
notice thereof to each Unitholder of the Trust thereby affected, identifying the
bonds eliminated and the bonds substituted therefore. Except as stated herein   
and under "Fund Administration--Replacement Bonds" in Prospectus Part II        
regarding the substitution of Replacement Bonds for Failed Bonds, the           
acquisition by a Trust of any securities other than the bonds initially         
deposited is not permitted.                                                     

If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any bonds occurs
and no provision for payment is made therefore within 30 days, the Trustee is   
required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails to instruct the    
Trustee to sell or to hold such bonds within 30 days after notification by the  
Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the Trustee may in its discretion sell  
the defaulted bond and not be liable for any depreciation or loss thereby       
incurred.

investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New
York 11217, telephone (800) 856-8487. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to 
supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of New  
York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits 
are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent          
permitted by law.                                                               

The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not 
participate in the selection of bonds for the portfolios of any of the Trusts.  
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books of  
record and account of all transactions at its office for the Trusts. Such       
records shall include the name and address of every Unitholder of the Trusts.   
Such books and records shall be open to inspection by any Unitholder at all     
reasonable times during the usual business hours. The Trustee shall make such   
annual or other reports as may from time to time be required under any          
applicable state or federal statute, rule or regulation. The Trustee is         
required to keep a certified copy or duplicate original of the Trust Agreement  
on file in its office available for inspection at all reasonable times during   
the usual business hours by any Unitholder, together with a current list of the 
bonds held in the Trusts.                                                       

Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of the trusts created by the Trust Agreement by executing an  
instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The Trustee or      
successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to all          
Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified in  
such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon receiving 
notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee          
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed    
and has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the         
retiring Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the         
appointment of a successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a    
successor trustee as provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or        
without cause. Notice of such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each   
Unitholder by the Sponsor. Upon execution of a written acceptance of such       
appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and       
obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the successor. The            
resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes effective only when the successor   
trustee accepts its appointment as such or when a court of competent            
jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee. Any corporation into which a Trustee 
may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation          
resulting from any merger or consolidation to which a Trustee shall be a party, 
shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee must be a banking corporation       
organized under the laws of the United States or any state and having at all    
times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than      
$5,000,000.                                                                     

Termination of the Trust Agreement

   A Trust may be terminated at any time by consent of Unitholders of 51% of the
Units of such Trust then outstanding (or with respect to Van Kampen Unit Trusts,
Municipal Series 654 and subsequent series, by consent of Unitholders of 75% of 
the Units of such Trust then outstanding) or by the Trustee when the value of   
such Trust, as shown by any semi-annual evaluation, is less than 20% of the     
original principal amount of bonds. A Trust will be liquidated by the Trustee in
the event that a sufficient number of Units not yet sold are tendered for       
redemption by the Underwriters, including the Sponsor, so that the net worth of 
such Trust would be reduced to less than 40% of the initial principal amount of 
such Trust. If a Trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold Units  
by the Underwriters, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the     
entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust Agreement provides that   
each Trust shall terminate upon the redemption, sale or other disposition of the
last bond held in such Trust, but in no event shall it continue beyond the end  
of the year preceding the fiftieth anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the    
case of an IM-IT, an IM-IT Laddered Series, an Investment Grade Municipal, an   
Investment Grade Municipal Limited Maturity Trust, a 10-20 Year Trust, an IM-IT 
Discount, a U.S. Territorial IM-IT, a High Grade Tax-Exempt Bond Trust, 20+ Year
Series, a Long-Term State or a National Quality Trust, or beyond the end of the 
year preceding the twentieth anniversary of the Trust Agreement in the case of a
Strategic Municipal Trust Intermediate Series, an IM-IT Limited Maturity Trust, 
an IM-IT Intermediate Trust, a State Intermediate Trust, a State Intermediate   
Laddered Maturity Trust, an IM-IT Short Intermediate Trust, an Investment Grade 
Municipal Intermediate Trust and a Quality Municipals Income Trust Limited      
Maturity Series. In the event of termination of any Trust, written notice       
thereof will be sent by the Trustee to each Unitholder of such Trust at his     
address appearing on the registration books of such Trust maintained by the     
Trustee. Within a reasonable time thereafter the Trustee shall liquidate any    
bond then held in such Trust and shall deduct from the funds of such Trust any  
accrued costs, expenses or indemnities provided by the Trust Agreement,         
including estimated compensation of the Trustee and costs of liquidation and any
amounts required as a reserve to provide for payment of any applicable taxes or 
other government charges. The sale of bonds in the Trust upon termination may   
result in a lower amount than might otherwise be realized if such sale were not 
required at such time. For this reason, among others, the amount realized by a  
Unitholder upon termination may be less than the principal amount or par amount 
of bonds represented by the Units held by such Unitholder. The Trustee shall    
then distribute to each Unitholder his share of the balance of the Interest and 
Principal Accounts. With such distribution the Unitholder shall be furnished a  
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the   
Trustee in its sole discretion shall determine that any amounts held in reserve 
are no longer necessary, it shall make distribution thereof to Unitholders in   
the same manner.                                                                

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with final distributions to  
Unitholders of an Insured Trust, it should be noted that because the portfolio  
insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, if any, is applicable only while bonds  
so insured are held by such Trust, the price to be received by such Trust upon  
the disposition of any such bond which is in default, by reason of nonpayment   
of principal or interest, will not reflect any value based on such insurance.   
Therefore, in connection with any liquidation, it shall not be necessary for    
the Trustee to, and the Trustee does not currently intend to, dispose of any    
bond or bonds if retention of such bond or bonds, until due, shall be deemed to 
be in the best interest of Unitholders, including, but not limited to,          
situations in which a bond or bonds so insured have deteriorated market prices  
resulting from a significant risk of default. Since the Preinsured Bonds will   
reflect the value of the related insurance, it is the present intention of the  
Sponsor not to direct the Trustee to hold any of such Preinsured Bonds after    
the date of termination. All proceeds received, less applicable expenses, from  
insurance on defaulted bonds not disposed of at the date of termination will    
ultimately be distributed to Unitholders of record as of such date of           
termination as soon as practicable after the date such defaulted bond or bonds  
become due and applicable insurance proceeds have been received by the          
Trustee.                                                                        

Description of Ratings

Standard & Poor's, A Division of the McGraw-Hill Companies. A Standard &  
Poor's municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of 
an obligor with respect to a specific debt bond. This assessment of             
creditworthiness may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors,       
insurers or lessees.                                                            

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase or sell a security,   
inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price.                             

 The ratings are based on current information furnished to Standard & Poor's
by the issuer and obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers 
reliable. The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of     
changes in, or unavailability of, such information.                             

 The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:

     I.   Likelihood of payment--capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet
          its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms
of the obligation.                                          

II.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation.                      

III. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the bond in the
       event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the
  laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.

  AAA--This is the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poor's. The obligor's
capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely        
strong.                                                                         

  AA--An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest-rated obligations only
in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the 
obligation is very strong.                                                      

A--An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to adverse effects
of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in         
higher-rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity to meet its financial  
commitment on the obligation is still strong.                                   

BBB--An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.   
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely  
to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment  
on the obligation.                                                              

  Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by the
addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major     
rating categories.                                                              

Provisional Ratings: A provisional rating ("p") assumes the successful    
completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicates that   
payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the  
successful and timely completion of the project. This rating, however, while    
addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project, makes no     
comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such        
completion. The investor should exercise his own judgment with respect to such  
likelihood and risk.                                                            

Moody's Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable     
Moody's rating symbols and their meanings follows:                              

  Aaa--Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be the best quality. They carry
the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as "gilt   
edge". Interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable 
margin and principal is secure. While the various protective elements are likely
to change, such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the    
fundamentally strong position of such issues.                                   

Aa--Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all      
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally known   
as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds because margins   
of protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities or fluctuations of       
protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements  
present which make the long-term risks appear somewhat larger than in Aaa       
securities.                                                                     

 A--Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes and
are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors giving security 
to principal and interest are considered adequate, but elements may be present  
which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future.            

Baa--Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade obligations;
i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured. Interest payment    
and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective   
elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great  
length of time. Such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in   
fact have speculative characteristics as well.                                  

  Note: Moody's applies numerical modifiers, 1, 2 and 3 in each generic rating
classification from Aa through B in its corporate bond rating system. The       
modifier 1 indicates that the security ranks in the higher end of its generic   
rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 
3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating         
category.                                                                       

State Trust Risk Factors

California Risk Factors                                                   

General Economic Conditions                                               

   Economic Outlook. The economy of the State is the largest among the 50 states
and one of the largest and most diverse in the world. The diversified economy of
the State has major components in high technology, trade, entertainment,        
agriculture, manufacturing, government, tourism, construction and financial     
services. Certain of the State's significant industries, such as high           
technology, are sensitive to economic disruptions in their export markets.      

The State's economy is in the midst of a gradual recovery from the most   
severe economic downturn and financial pressure since the 1930s. Continued      
growth in the high-technology sector, international trade and tourism along with
improvements in residential construction and real estate markets have been      
positive indicators of California's broadening economic recovery. While         
persistent unemployment impedes greater economic growth and revenue generation, 
analysts generally expect the State's economy to continue to expand at a        
moderate pace in the near future. The Legislative Analyst's Office ("LAO"), a   
non-partisan fiscal and policy adviser, has projected that the State's economic 
recovery should continue its steady progress and that the State will continue   
its progress in building budget reserves under the recently approved Proposition
2; however, continued uncertainty about the effects of federal policy and weak  
global growth create fiscal risks and pressures to a more robust recovery. There
can be no assurance that the positive economic and fiscal trends will continue  
or that the economy will not become more difficult.                             

As of April 2016, California's unemployment was 5.3%, compared to 12.4% at
the recession's peak in October 2010 and the pre-recession low of 4.8% in       
November 2006. Job growth in the State increased by 2.8% during the twelve-month
period ending April 2016. Due to slow but consistent job growth since February  
2010, California has gained approximately 2,195,000 jobs through April 2016,    
gaining an average of 29,700 jobs per month over the course of the 74-month     
expansion.                                                                      

Geography. California's geographic location subjects it to earthquake and 
wildfire risks. It is impossible to predict the time, magnitude or location of a
major earthquake or wildfire or its effect on the California economy. In August 
2014, a major earthquake struck the Napa Valley area, causing significant damage
in a three county area. In October 2007, a series of wildfires burned across    
Southern California, forcing approximately 1 million evacuations and causing    
significant damage in seven counties. The possibility exists that other such    
earthquakes or wildfires could create major dislocation of the California       
economy and could significantly affect State and local governmental budgets.    

States of Emergency. On May 20, 2015, the Governor declared a state of    
emergency for Santa Barbara County due to the effects of an oil spill. The spill
was the result of a pipeline rupture that caused the release of more than       
100,000 gallons of oil and other potentially hazardous substances into the      
Pacific Ocean near Refugio State Beach. In his proclamation of a state of       
emergency, the Governor acknowledged that local governments and businesses along
the Santa Barbara County coast will suffer long-term impacts from the spill. The
actual impact of the spill on the State's economy is impossible to estimate,    
however, the overall cost of the clean-up, long-term environmental damage and   
resulting loss of revenue could be substantial.                                 

State Budgets                                                             

  Budget Process. California has a fiscal year ending on June 30 of each year.
Under the State constitution, the Governor must submit a proposed budget to the 
Legislature by January 10 of the preceding fiscal year and the Legislature must 
adopt a final budget by June 15 of the preceding fiscal year. Both the proposed 
budget and final budget are required to be balanced, in that General Fund       
expenditures must not exceed projected General Fund revenues and transfers for  
the fiscal year.                                                                

California receives revenues from taxes, fees and other sources, the most 
significant of which are personal income tax, sales and use tax and corporate   
tax (which collectively constitute more than 90% of General Fund revenues and   
transfers). During the economic downturn, historic revenue shortfalls resulted  
in multi-billion dollar budget deficits for consecutive fiscal years and severe 
cash shortages in California. During the 2011-12 and 2012-13 fiscal years, the  
State budget addressed approximately $20 billion in annual deficits through a   
combination of significant spending cuts, temporary tax increases, borrowing,   
and other budgetary measures. While the State has continued to face fiscal      
pressure from deferred budgetary obligations accumulated over the prior decade, 
primarily to schools and local governments (the so-called "Wall of Debt"), and  
unfunded liabilities associated with the state employee retirement systems and  
state retiree health benefits, the State projects that the budget will be       
balanced in an ongoing manner until at least fiscal year 2017-18. However,      
unanticipated or rising costs, revenue shortfalls or the State's inability to   
enact or effectively realize budget solutions may adversely affect California's 
fiscal outlook and cause the State to continue facing acute long-term challenges
and budget deficits.                                                            

  Current Budget. The California State Budget for the 2015-16 fiscal year (the
"2015 Budget Act") was passed by the State Legislature and signed by the        
Governor on June 24, 2015. The 2015 Budget Act projected General Fund revenues  
and transfers in fiscal year 2015-16 of $117.4 billion (including the $2.4      
billion balance carried over from the 2014-15 fiscal year) and authorized       
General Fund expenditures of $115.4 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30,
2016. The 2014-15 budget established a multi-year plan to eliminate the $74     
billion in unfunded accrued liability in the California State Teachers'         
Retirement System (CalSTRS) by increasing contributions from the State, school  
districts and teachers over time; and consistent with that strategy, the 2015   
Budget Act includes a $1.9 billion General Fund allocation for state            
contributions to CalSTRS.                                                       

   In its annual report on California's fiscal outlook, released on November 18,
2015 (the "Fiscal Report"), the LAO provided an independent assessment of       
California's economic outlook and the State's projected General Fund revenues   
and expenditures. The Fiscal Report, which described the budget situation       
through 2016-17 as decidedly positive, estimated that California would continue 
to experience growth in General Fund revenues resulting in budget surpluses of  
$7.9 billion by the end of fiscal year 2015-16 and $11.5 billion at the end of  
2016-17. The Fiscal Report notes that under this scenario the Legislature would 
have control over $4.3 billion in the Special Fund for Economic uncertainties,  
with the rest of the reserves held for future budget emergencies as required by 
Proposition 2. While the LAO considered continued economic growth its main      
forecast scenario, the Fiscal Report cautioned that its outlook was based on the
assumption that the economy will continue to grow through 2019-20 and that no   
additional budget commitments will be made. The LAO cautioned that budget       
surpluses could be reduced or eliminated if, among other things, (1) the economy
is weak, or (2) "if the state's two key pension boards lower their assumptions  
concerning future investment returns," which would require state contributions  
to CalSTRS and CalPERS (defined below) to increase.                             

The Governor's proposed Budget for the 2016-17 fiscal year (the " 2016    
Governor's Budget"), released on January 7, 2016, provided an update to the     
State's economic outlook at the end of the 2015-16 fiscal year relative to the  
2015 Budget Act. The 2016 Governor's Budget projected General Fund revenues and 
transfers of 121.5 billion (an increase of $3.7 billion) and General Fund       
expenditures of $116.1 billion (an increase of $700 million) for the 2015-16    
fiscal year. Assuming all of the budgetary actions proposed by the Governor are 
successfully implemented, the 2016 Governor's Budget projected a budget reserve 
of $1.1 billion plus a contribution to the State's new rainy day fund of $2.9   
billion as of June 30, 2016. The 2016 Governor's Budget reiterated the fiscal   
goals contained in the 2015 Budget Act for the State to eliminate the Wall of   
Debt and pay down the State's unfunded retirement liabilities.                  

Future Budgets.                                                           

 The 2016 Governor's Budget projected General Fund revenues and transfers in
fiscal year 2016-17 of $125.1 billion and proposed General Fund expenditures of 
$122.6 billion for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, assuming adoption of all
proposed budget measures, including $3.6 billion increase in funding for state  
and local transportation and infrastructure programs and further reduction of   
California's Wall of Debt. The 2016 Governor's Budget also proposed a plan to   
eliminate the unfunded retirement liabilities of the State by fiscal year       
2045-46 through cost-sharing arrangements between the State and public employees
with respect to retiree health benefits. Such cost-sharing arrangements will    
require the approval of applicable public employee bargaining units at the time 
of labor contract renewals. Assuming enactment of the proposed budget's         
corrective actions, the 2016 Governor's Budget projected a $1.1 billion         
available reserve and a rainy day fund contribution of $3.6 billion at the end  
of the 2016-17 fiscal year.                                                     

In its January 11, 2016 "Overview of the Governor's Budget" (the "LAO     
Overview"), the LAO projected much greater revenue collection by the State in   
fiscal year 2016-17, but cautioned that the state's long period of revenue      
growth may be reaching its peak. The LAO commended the Governor's continued     
commitment to fiscal discipline and emphasis on building up reserves and        
encouraged the legislature to set robust targets for reserves for the end of the
2016-17 fiscal year and to concentrate spending on one-time purposes before     
beginning the process of choosing a mix of reserves, one time spending, and     
ongoing budget commitments. The LAO Overview emphasized that California's       
long-term budgetary plans remain vulnerable to market downturns that may        
re-emerge with little warning, which makes building sizeable reserves to allay  
future revenue volatility an ongoing priority.                                  

It cannot be predicted what actions will be taken in the future by the    
Legislature and the Governor to deal with changing State revenues and           
expenditures. The State budget will be affected by national and State economic  
conditions and other factors.                                                   

Constraints on the Budget Process. Constitutional amendments approved by  
voters affect the budget process. These include Proposition 58, approved in 2004
and amended by voters effective as of the 2015-16 fiscal year, which requires   
the State to enact a balanced budget, establish a special rainy day fund in the 
General Fund and restrict future borrowing to cover budget deficits; and        
Proposition 25, approved by voters in 2010, which decreased the vote required   
for the Legislature to adopt a final budget from a two-thirds majority vote to a
simple majority vote. Proposition 25 retained the two-thirds vote requirement   
for taxes. As a result of the provisions requiring the enactment of a balanced  
budget and restricting borrowing, the State may, in some cases, have to take    
immediate actions during the fiscal year to correct budgetary shortfalls. The   
balanced budget determination is made by subtracting expenditures from all      
available resources, including prior-year balances.                             

If the Governor determines that the State is facing substantial revenue   
shortfalls or spending deficiencies, the Governor is authorized to declare a    
fiscal emergency and call the Legislature into special session to consider      
proposed legislation to address the emergency. If the Legislature fails to pass 
and send to the Governor legislation to address the budgetary or fiscal         
emergency within 45 days, the Legislature would be prohibited from acting on any
other bills or adjourning in joint recess until such legislation is passed.     
During the economic downturn from fiscal year 2008-09 to fiscal year 2010-11,   
the Governor declared fiscal emergencies on January 10, 2008, December 1, 2008, 
July 1, 2009, January 8, 2010, July 28, 2010, November 11, 2010 and January 20,
2011, and called five special sessions of the Legislature to resolve the budget 
imbalances, enact economic stimulus and address the State's liquidity problems. 

Proposition 58 (adopted as section 20 of article XVI of the State's       
Constitution) also requires 3% of estimated annual General Fund revenues to be  
transferred by the Controller into a rainy day fund (the Budget Stabilization   
Account) no later than September 30 of each fiscal year. These transfers will be
made until the balance in the Budget Stabilization Account reaches $8 billion or
5% of the estimated General Fund revenues for that fiscal year, whichever is    
greater, and then whenever the balance falls below the $8 billion or 5% target. 
The annual transfers can be suspended or reduced for a fiscal year by an        
executive order issued by the Governor no later than June 1 of the preceding    
fiscal year. The Governor issued such an executive order for each fiscal year   
from 2008-09 through 2013-14. The 2015 Budget Act projects a transfer of $3.4   
billion to the Budget Stabilization Account as of June 30, 2016, half of which  
would be used to repay outstanding economic recovery bonds.                     

Commencing in the 2015-16 fiscal year, Proposition 2 approved by voters in
the November 2014 general election amends Proposition 58 to require 1.5% of     
estimated annual General Fund revenues and an additional specified portion of   
General Fund revenues attributable to personal income taxes on net capital gains
to be transferred by the Controller into the Budget Stabilization Account no    
later than October 1 of each fiscal year. These transfers will be made until the
balance in the Budget Stabilization Account reaches 10% of the estimated General
Fund revenues for that fiscal year. From the 2015-16 fiscal year until the      
2029-30 fiscal year, half of the General Fund revenues which would be           
transferrable to the Budget Stabilization Account will be used to repay deferred
budgetary obligations, including unfunded state pension plan obligations and    
outstanding economic recovery bonds As a result of the amendment under          
Proposition 2, the annual transfers may only be suspended or reduced by a bill  
passed by the Legislature in response to the Governor's proclamation of a budget
emergency and withdrawals from the Budget Stabilization Account during budget   
emergencies are subject to limitations.                                         

 Proposition 58 prohibits certain future borrowing to cover budget deficits.
This restriction applies to general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, and certain
other forms of long-term borrowing. The restriction does not apply to certain   
other types of borrowing, such as short-term borrowing to cover cash shortfalls 
in the General Fund (including revenue anticipation notes or revenue            
anticipation warrants currently used by the State), or inter-fund borrowings.   

 Proposition 2 also creates a Public School System Stabilization Account for
the support of California school districts and community college districts.     
General Fund revenues attributable to personal income taxes on net capital gains
in excess of the specified portion dedicated to the Budget Stabilization Account
are required to be transferred by the Controller to the Public School System    
Stabilization Account. Under current projections, Proposition 2 will result in  
$7.1 billion in savings and $5.5 billion in additional reductions of debt and   
liabilities in its first four years of operation.                               

State Indebtedness                                                        

   General Obligation Bonds and Revenue Bonds. As of February 1, 2016, the State
had approximately $86.4 billion aggregate principal of outstanding long-term    
general obligation bonds. The current estimate of the interest to be paid on the
principal amount outstanding is approximately $64 billion. As of February 1,
2016, general obligation bond authorizations of approximately $28.3 billion     
remained unissued.                                                              

Ratings. As of February 23, 2016 the State's general obligation bonds were
rated Aa3 by Moody's, AA- by Standard & Poor's ("S&P"), and A+ by Fitch Ratings.
On July 2, 2015, S&P raised California's general obligation bond rating from A+ 
to AA-, citing the enactment of the 2015 Budget Act as marking improved fiscal  
sustainability. On June 25, 2014, Moody's upgraded California's general         
obligation bond rating from A1 to Aa3, citing the State's "rapidly improving    
financial position, high but declining debt metrics, adjusted net pension       
liability ratios that are close to the state median, strong liquidity, and      
robust employment growth." On February 25, 2015, Fitch Ratings upgraded         
California's general obligation bond rating from A to A+ citing the State's     
"continued improvement in its fundamental fiscal position, institutionalized    
changes to its fiscal operations, and its ongoing economic and revenue recovery 
as contributing to an improved financial position and enhancing the State's     
ability to address future fiscal challenges." The ratings agencies continue to  
monitor the State's budget outlook closely to determine whether to alter the    
ratings. It is not possible to determine whether, or the extent to which,       
Moody's, S&P or Fitch Ratings will change such ratings in the future.           

Infrastructure Planning. On January 7, 2016, the Governor released        
"California's Five-Year Infrastructure Plan" (the "Infrastructure Plan"), the   
statewide infrastructure plan provided by the Governor to the California        
Legislature. The plan proposed $55 billion in infrastructure spending through   
fiscal year 2020-21, including $36 billion for the preservation and improvement 
of the State's existing highway and intercity railway systems and $25.2 billion 
for the construction of the State's high-speed railway system. Of this amount,  
$9 billion is from the State's various special funds, $13.9 billion is expected 
to be paid from federal funding, $350 million from general obligation bond      
issuances, $705 million from General Fund revenues, and $4.1 billion from other 
sources. The 2016 Governor's Budget incorporated the Infrastructure Plan's      
proposed expenditures for the 2016-17 fiscal year, including a one-time         
allocation of $807 million in State revenues ($500 million from General Fund    
revenues, $289 million from the Proposition 98 General Fund, and $18 million    
from the Motor Vehicle Fund) to fund the most critical deferred maintenance     
projects on state roads and highways, courts, state parks, prisons, schools,    
hospitals and other state facilities.                                           

On June 16, 2015, the Governor called a special legislative session to    
consider funding improved maintenance of roads, highways and other              
infrastructure. The proposals from the special legislative session, including a 
$3.6 billion annual increase for state and local transportation infrastructure  
programs, are generally reflected in the 2016 Governor's Budget. The legislature
is considering legislation to enact permanent and sustainable funding to        
maintain and repair the state's transportation and critical infrastructure,     
improve the state's key trade corridors and complement local infrastructure     
efforts.                                                                        

The California State Budget for the 2014-15 fiscal year (the "2014 Budget 
Act") passed by the State Legislature and signed by the Governor on June 20,
2014, permanently allocated 60% of future cap and trade auction proceeds to     
support sustainable communities, public transit, and the high-speed railway     
project. Consistent with the 2014 Budget Act, the 2016 Governor's Budget        
allocates 60% of cap and trade revenues to support sustainable communities,     
public transit, and the high-speed railway project.                             

 In January 2014, the administration released a Water Action Plan to address
water challenges facing California through the 2018-19 fiscal year, including   
limited and uncertain water supplies, poor-quality surface water and            
groundwater, impaired ecosystems and high flood risk. In addition to the Water  
Action Plan, in the November 2014 general election, voters authorized the State 
to issue $7.5 billion in general obligation bonds for state water supply        
infrastructure projects, such as public water system improvements, surface and  
groundwater storage, advanced water treatment technology, drought relief,       
emergency water supplies, and ecosystem and watershed protection and            
restoration. The 2015 Budget Act proposed spending $1.5 billion over the next   
three years and the 2016 Governor's Budget proposed $635 million in increased   
spending on projects to improve safe drinking water, water recycling, wastewater
treatment projects, storm water management, groundwater sustainability, and to  
prevent groundwater contamination.                                              

In March 2015, the Governor signed legislation providing $1.06 billion in 
funds for flood protection projects and projects to improve access to water     
supplies. The funding package includes $267 million for drinking water and      
recycling projects, $53 million to provide immediate assistance to communities  
facing water supply issues and $26 million to help the State deal with drought  
related environmental issues. Of the $1.059 billion package, $927 million is    
from previously approved general obligation bonds, $30 million is from cap and  
trade proceeds, $27 million is from special funds, and approximately $75 million
is from the General Fund.                                                       

 Under certain circumstances, the State also provides infrastructure funding
assistance to local governments and the private sector such as for schools and  
local transportation programs, water projects, housing developments, and        
hospitals.                                                                      

  Deferred Obligations. As part of the budget solutions in fiscal years during
the recession, the State repeatedly deferred payment of certain General Fund    
obligations (including Proposition 98 payments to schools, Medi-Cal             
reimbursements, state payrolls and payments to the state pension fund) and      
approved the sale of economic recovery bonds, interfund borrowing and loans from
state and local governments. As a result of these short-term budget-balancing   
actions, the General Fund is obligated to repay or make reimbursements in future
years. The State's enacted budgets for fiscal years 2012-13, 2013-14, 2014-15,  
and 2015-16 reduced these repayment obligations from $34.2 billion to $14.9     
billion. The 2015 Governor's Act proposed further reductions in California's    
deferred obligations by $4.5 billion and projected that all outstanding         
budgetary deferrals and borrowing of the State will be repaid by the end of the 
2018-19 fiscal year.                                                            

  State Pension Funds. The two main State pension funds, the California Public
Employees' Retirement System ("CalPERS") and CalSTRS, currently have substantial
unfunded liabilities. On April 14, 2014, CalPERS estimated that its unfunded    
accrued liability as of June 30, 2013 was $49.9 billion on a market value of    
assets basis. CalSTRS reported that the unfunded actuarial liability of its     
Defined Benefit Plan as of June 30, 2014 was $72.7 billion on an actuarial basis
and $61.8 billion on a market value basis. The State also has an unfunded       
liability relating to other State retirees' post-employment health care benefits
which is estimated to be $71.8 billion as of June 30, 2014.                     

   General Fund contributions to CalPERS and CalSTRS for fiscal year 2015-16 are
estimated to be approximately $2.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The  
2014 Budget Act also enacted a plan to eliminate CalSTRS' current unfunded      
liability by the 2045-46 fiscal year by increasing the mandatory contributions  
by the State, teachers and school districts. There can be no assurances that the
State's annual required contributions to CalPERS will not also significantly    
increase in the future.                                                         

   On September 12, 2012, the State adopted the Public Employees' Pension Reform
Act of 2013 which reduces pension benefits for newly-hired CalPERS employees,   
encourages later retirement and caps compensation in calculating pension        
benefits for higher-income employees. In a preliminary actuarial analysis,      
CalPERS estimated that the reform legislation will reduce costs to the State by 
$10.3 billion to $12.6 billion over the next 30 years.                          

Medi-Cal and Health Care Reform. Following the implementation of the      
Affordable Care Act, total Medi-Cal enrollment rose from 7.9 million in fiscal  
year 2012-13 to 13.5 million in fiscal year 2015-16, covering over 33% of the   
State's population. The 2016 Governor's Budget projected General Fund           
expenditures in fiscal year 2016-17 of $19.1 billion for California's Medi-Cal  
program (after the application of federal matching funds). The 2016 Governor's  
Budget estimated additional Medi-Cal caseload of 1.5 million individuals and    
costs of $17.7 billion related to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.
California will share the cost with the federal government.                     

   The net impact of the health care reform on the State's budget will depend on
a number of factors, including levels of individual and employer participation  
and any changes in the federal matching rate and insurance premiums. Actual     
costs could differ materially as the Affordable Care Act is implemented and as  
the California Legislature realigns responsibility for certain health care and  
long-term care programs between the State and local governments.                

   Local Government. The primary units of local government in California are the
counties, which vary significantly in size and population. There are also       
hundreds of incorporated cities and thousands of other special districts formed 
for education, utility and other services. Counties are responsible for         
provision of many basic services, including indigent healthcare, welfare,       
courts, jails and public safety in unincorporated areas. The 2011 Budget Act    
instituted a major realignment of responsibility for public safety programs from
the State to local governments, including certain criminal justice programs,    
mental health services, substance abuse treatment, child and elderly welfare    
programs and the California Work Opportunity and Responsibility to Kids         
(CalWORKs). With the implementation of the federal Affordable Care Act, counties
are expected to experience significant savings in their indigent healthcare     
programs as participants enroll in the State's expanded Medi-Cal program. In    
recognition of this shift in responsibility for indigent healthcare, the 2013   
Budget Act established a mechanism to redirect a portion of each county's cost  
savings to benefit the State.                                                   

Local governments are limited in their ability to raise revenues due to   
constitutional constraints on their ability to impose or increase various taxes,
fees, and assessments without voter approval. Counties, in particular, have had 
fewer options to raise revenues than many other local government entities.      

Local governments in California have experienced notable financial        
difficulties from time to time, and there is no assurance that any California   
issuer will make full or timely payments of principal or interest or remain     
solvent. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations issued by  
local California issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by the State, and there is no obligation on the part of the State to make
payment on such local obligations in the event of default.                      

Proposition 1A, enacted by the Legislature and approved by the voters in  
November 2004, has reduced the Legislature's authority over local government    
revenue sources by placing restrictions on the State's access to local          
governments' property, sales and vehicle licensing revenues. Proposition 1A also
prohibits the State from mandating activities on cities, counties or special    
districts without providing for the funding needed to comply with the mandates. 
The State mandate provisions of Proposition 1A do not apply to schools or       
community colleges or to mandates relating to employee rights.                  

Proposition 22, enacted by the Legislature and approved by the voters in  
November 2010, supersedes Proposition 1A and prohibits any future borrowing by  
the State from local government funds, and generally prohibits the Legislature  
from making changes in local government funding sources. Allocation of local    
transportation funds cannot be changed without an extensive process.            

  Constitutional and Legislative Factors. Initiative constitutional amendments
affecting State and local taxes and appropriations have been proposed and       
adopted pursuant to the State's initiative process from time to time. If any    
such initiatives are adopted, the State could be pressured to provide additional
financial assistance to local governments or appropriate revenues as mandated by
such initiatives. Propositions that may be adopted in the future may also place 
increasing pressure on the State's budget over future years, potentially        
reducing resources available for other State programs, especially to the extent 
any mandated spending limits would restrain the State's ability to fund such    
other programs by raising taxes. Because of the complexities of constitutional  
amendments and related legislation concerning appropriations and spending       
limits, the ambiguities and possible inconsistencies in their terms, the        
applicability of any exceptions and exemptions and the impossibility of         
predicting future appropriations, it is not possible to predict the impact on   
the bonds in the portfolio of the California Series.                            

Effect of other State Laws on Bond Obligations. Some of the California    
municipal securities in which the California Series can invest may be           
obligations payable solely from the revenues of a specific institution or       
secured by specific properties. These are subject to provisions of California   
law that could adversely affect the holders of such obligations. For example,   
the revenues of California healthcare institutions may be adversely affected by 
State laws reducing Medi-Cal reimbursement rates, and California law limits the 
remedies available to a creditor secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on real 
property. Debt obligations payable solely from revenues of healthcare           
institutions may also be insured by the State but no guarantee exists that      
adequate reserve funds will be appropriated by the Legislature for such purpose.

   Litigation. The State is a party to numerous legal proceedings, many of which
normally occur in governmental operations. In addition, the State is involved in
certain other legal proceedings that, if decided against the State might require
the State to make significant future expenditures or impair future revenue      
sources. Because of the prospective nature of these proceedings, it is not      
presently possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or estimate the    
potential impact on the ability of the State to pay debt service costs on its   
obligations.                                                                    

On March 25, 2011, the trial court in The Rehabilitation Center of Beverly
Hills, et al. v. Department of Health Services et al. ruled that the quality    
assurance fee ("QAF") charged to skilled nursing facilities since 2004 was      
properly characterized as a "tax" rather than a "fee." The trial court then     
denied the plaintiffs' claim for refund of QAF amounts, finding that the QAF was
constitutionally valid. Plaintiffs have appealed the denial of refund. The QAF  
amounts collected from all providers is approximately $2.6 billion, and         
California has received additional federal financial participation based on its 
imposition and collection of the QAF. An adverse ruling could also negatively   
affect the State's receipt of federal funds.                                    

On October 7, 2010, the San Francisco County Superior Court in Gillette   
Company v. Franchise Tax Board, a consolidation of six actions by several       
multi-state corporations, ruled that the Legislature's modification of the      
Revenue and Taxation Code, implementing a double-weighted sales factor in       
California's apportionment of income formula for the taxation of multi-state    
business entities, was valid and constitutional. The California Court of Appeal,
First Appellate District, reversed the trial court judgment, and in its decision
issued in October 2012, held that the State was bound by the single-weighted    
sales factor contained in the Multistate Tax Compact for the tax years at issue 
and that attempting to override the Multistate Tax Compact violated the         
constitutional protections against impairment of contracts. The State has       
requested and the Supreme Court has accepted review of this case. The adverse   
ruling in this consolidated case affects multiple taxpayers and creates         
potential exposure to refund claims in excess of $750 million.                  

On August 29, 2008, the Los Angeles Superior Court ruled in favor of the  
plaintiff in Nortel Networks Inc. v. State Board of Equalization, a tax refund  
case involving the interpretation of certain statutory sales and use tax        
exemptions for computer software and licenses to use computer software that are 
transferred pursuant to technology transfer agreements. On January 18, 2011, the
adverse trial court ruling was upheld by the California Court of Appeal and a   
petition for review filed by the State Board was denied by the California       
Supreme Court. The adverse trial court ruling, if applied to other similarly    
situated taxpayers, unless limited in scope by two similar refund cases filed by
Lucent Technologies, Inc. against the State Board of Equalization, could have a 
significant negative impact in the range of approximately $300 million annually,
on tax revenues.                                                                

Two cases seeking to proceed as class actions (Bakersfield Mall LLC v.    
Franchise Tax Board and CA-Centerside II, LLC v. Franchise Tax Board) challenge 
the fee imposed by the California tax code upon limited liability companies     
registered in California, alleging discrimination against interstate commerce,  
violation the U.S. and California Constitutions, improper exercise of the       
State's police powers, and misapplication by the Franchise Tax Board. The cases 
were coordinated for hearing as the Franchise Tax Board LLC Tax Refund Cases and
subsequently denied class certification by a coordination trial judge. If the   
appealable order is reversed and either case proceeds as a class action, the    
claimed refunds could be in excess of $500 million.                             

In Gail Marie Harrington-Wisely, et al. v. State of California, et al., a 
class action asserting that the use by the California Department of Corrections 
and Rehabilitation (the "CDCR") of a body-imaging machine to search visitors to 
state prisons for contraband violated the rights of the visitors. The trial     
court granted judgment in favor of the State, and plaintiffs' appeal was        
dismissed by the California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District. The     
parties agreed to a stipulated judgment and dismissed the case subject to       
further review on or after 2013 if the CDCR uses similar technology in the      
future. If plaintiffs were successful in obtaining damages for every use of the 
body-imaging machine, damages could be as high as $3 billion.                   

Georgia Risk Factors                                                      

State Profile. Georgia is an economic hub of the southeast. The capital in
Atlanta is the major economic and population center of the State with major     
regional economic and population centers in Augusta, Savannah, and Macon.       
Georgia's economic base is diverse with major port facilities on the coast,     
agricultural resources throughout the State, manufacturing and service          
industries, and is a major transportation hub with the busiest airport in the   
nation. As of 2013, according the United States Census Bureau, Georgia is the   
eighth largest state with a population of 9.99 million people.                  

Economic Condition and Outlook. The U.S. economy has been in recovery for 
nearly four years and GDP growth has picked up several times only to slow       
again. The slow pace of recovery has left unemployment high and the economy     
growing below its long-term potential. Georgia's economy also is experiencing a 
moderate recovery with growth in employment, home prices, and residential       
construction permits. While a moderate economic recovery is expected to         
continue, there are significant risks to continued growth, with federal fiscal  
policy the biggest threat.                                                      

 Georgia added 91,600 net new jobs from September 2012 to September 2013. As
of December 2014, Georgia's unemployment rate of 7.7 percent is higher than the 
national rate of 5.9 percent. However, it has improved since the August 2013    
rate of 8.7 percent.                                                            

  Economic Factors. Georgia's economy is experiencing a moderate recovery with
growth in employment, home prices, and residential construction permits. While  
a moderate economic recovery is expected to continue, there are significant     
risks to continued growth, with federal fiscal policy the biggest threat.       

As of August 2013, the State's net new job growth rate exceeds the        
comparable rate through August for the U.S. employment growth of 1.7 percent.   
Initial unemployment compensation claims reflect a gradually improving labor    
market in the U.S. and in Georgia. Initial claims are well below year ago       
levels. Personal income growth has generally been positive on a quarter over    
quarter basis but personal income growth has been relatively weak when compared 
to prior recoveries. Home prices are recovering and trending positively. Home   
prices for metro Atlanta had risen 18.2 percent which exceeds the 12.2 percent  
increase for the composite index for 20 metro areas across the country.         

At the end of the current fiscal year, the General Fund reflected a total 
fund balance of $4.4 billion. The net change in fund balance during the fiscal  
year was $693.9 million or 15.8 percent compared to $5.8 million or 0.2 percent 
net change in the prior year. The General Fund ended the year with an           
unrestricted, unassigned fund balance of $798.6 million.                        

  The State's average unemployment rate for the fiscal year 2014 improved from
8.5 percent in 2013 to 7.7 percent as of October 2014. As a result, fewer       
claims were submitted and benefit payments decreased $381.3 million or 17.0     
percent this year compared to last fiscal year. Due to this small improvement   
in the economy, employer unemployment rates were reduced and the corresponding  
unemployment tax revenue decreased by $119.2 million or 5.2 percent. Employer   
taxes and other revenues exceeded benefit payments by $310.8 million.           

Personal income is another important economic indicator for states. For   
Georgia, personal income rose by .2 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 but is     
down .5 percent from 2009.                                                      

  Major Initiatives. Open Georgia is the State's initiative to bring increased
transparency and accountability to State government in Georgia, which was       
created when Senate Bill 300, Transparency in Government Act, was passed in     
2008 by the Georgia General Assembly. The Open Georgia website contains a       
searchable database of spending data for State salaries, travel expenditures    
and professional fees. The site was recently expanded to include 2009 State     
spending data on vendors and contracts awarded across most State agencies.      

  Budgetary Highlights. Fiscal conditions improved for the State during fiscal
year 2013 as net revenue collections were $18.3 billion or 5.9 percent greater  
than fiscal year 2012. Net Revenue Collections deposited with the Office of the 
State Treasurer during fiscal year 2013 were $135.2 million more than the       
initial revenue estimate per budget. Of the major tax sources, corporate and    
personal income tax collections were the largest components of overall tax      
growth at $206.6 million or 35 percent and $629.9 million or 7.7 percent,       
respectively.                                                                   

Georgia's fiscal year 2014 YTD tax revenue collections reported by the    
Department of Revenue are, through September, up 5.8 percent over the same      
period for fiscal year 2013 tax revenue and total State general funds           
collections are running ahead of budgeted growth (5.5 percent actual vs. 2.7    
percent budget). Individual income tax, which is the largest component of       
General Fund revenues, is up 4.9 percent.                                       

 Each year, the difference between funds available and expenditures is added
to or subtracted from the budgetary Revenue Shortfall Reserve ("RSR"). The      
reserve cannot exceed 15 percent of the previous fiscal year net budgetary      
revenue for any given fiscal year, and up to 1 percent of the preceding fiscal  
year's budgetary net revenue collections may be appropriated from the reserve   
to fund increased K-12 educational needs. The Governor may release RSR funds in 
excess of 4 percent of net revenue collections for appropriation.               

As the State continues to address the effects of one of the worst economic
downturns in recent history, the ending balance in the RSR is a critical tool   
in helping to address budget shortfalls. After reaching a peak in fiscal year   
2007 at $1.7 billion (9.2 percent of net revenue collections), the State's RSR  
balance declined to a low of $268.2 million (1.8 percent of net revenue         
collections) in fiscal year 2010. The RSR increased to $494.0 in 2011 and       
$550.7 million in 2012. In 2013, the RSR increased by $349.6 million and has a  
current balance of $900.3 million including audited agency lapse (approximately 
$218.2 million). The increase to the RSR was accomplished due to revenue        
collections exceeding revenue estimates ($316.0 million), reduction of agency   
allotment balances, and return of unexpended and unobligated funds by agencies. 

Due to uncertainty in federal fiscal policy, Georgia continues to take a  
conservative approach to the current and upcoming fiscal years. The current     
enacted fiscal year 2014 budget assumes tax revenue growth of 4.8 percent over  
the Amended fiscal year 2013 budget estimate. Compared to actual revenues for   
fiscal year 2013, the budget is balanced to 3.1 percent total tax revenue       
growth.                                                                         

 Debt Administration. The Georgia State Financing and Investment Commission,
an agency of the State, is empowered by law to receive the proceeds from the    
issuance of State of Georgia general obligation and guaranteed revenue debt, to 
provide for the proper application of use of the debt proceeds, and to          
establish the procedures for protecting the holders of such debt. At the end of 
the fiscal year 2013, the State had total bonded debt outstanding of $11.8      
billion.                                                                        

Risk Management. The State is self-insured against certain property and   
liability claims, including workers' compensation and unemployment              
compensation. The Risk Management Funds accumulate reserves for certain         
property and liability risks and pay for commercial insurance coverage.         
Revenues are generated from premiums charged to State and local government      
organizations. Various risk control techniques are utilized to minimize         
accident-related losses; risk managers also identify unique loss exposures and  
develop strategies to reduce the cost of risk associated with individual        
business operations.                                                            

Ratings. As of December 2014, all outstanding general obligation bonds of 
the State of Georgia are rated AAA by S&P with a stable outlook, Aaa by Moody's 
with a stable outlook and AAA by Fitch with a stable outlook. Any explanation   
concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained from the rating    
agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue for any period   
of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.                          

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Georgia issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness of     
obligations issued by the State of Georgia, and there is no obligation on the   
part of the State to make payment on such local obligations in the event of     
default.                                                                        

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the 
general factors which may impact certain issuers of bonds contained in your     
Georgia trust and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of
all adverse conditions to which the issuers of such obligations are subject.    
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and environmental
policies and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such
bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition  
of the State and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds contained in your Georgia trust, the
market value or marketability of such bonds or the ability of the respective    
issuers of such bonds acquired by your Georgia trust to pay interest on or      
principal of such bonds.                                                        

Your Georgia trust is susceptible to political, economic or regulatory    
factors affecting issuers of Georgia municipal obligations (the "Georgia        
Municipal Obligations"). These include the possible adverse effects of certain  
Georgia constitutional amendments, legislative measures, voter initiatives and  
other matters that are described.                                               

The information provided above is only a brief summary of the complex     
factors affecting the financial situation in Georgia and is derived from        
sources that are generally available to investors and are believed to be        
accurate. No independent verification has been made of the accuracy or          
completeness of any of the foregoing information. It is based in part on        
information obtained from various State and local agencies in Georgia or        
contained in Official Statements for various Georgia Municipal Obligations.     

Puerto Rico Risk Factors                                                  

 Certain Trusts may invest in bonds issued by issuers located in Puerto Rico
("Puerto Rico," or the "Commonwealth"). As further described under "Ratings",   
Puerto Rico's general obligation bonds are all currently rated below investment 
grade following a number of downgrades by the major credit rating agencies. As  
a result, the Commonwealth's access to the liquidity markets may be limited,    
and further, the Commonwealth may not be able to honor all of its obligations   
as they come due.                                                               

  On April 21, 2015, the Commonwealth filed a Notice of Failure to File Annual
Report which stated that the Commonwealth did not provide its audited financial 
statements for fiscal year 2014 by the filing deadline of May 1, 2015 as        
required by its continuing disclosure undertakings made in connection with its  
bond issuances, and that the Commonwealth expected to file its 2014 Financial   
Statements by July 31, 2015. However, the Annual Report has not yet been filed  
as of October 2015. Therefore, some of the information contained below,         
although the most recent data, may not be representative of the Commonwealth's  
current economic condition.                                                     

 Relevant History. Puerto Rico came under United States sovereignty in 1898.
In 1950, Congress enacted Public Law 600, which provided that the existing      
political, economic and fiscal relationship between Puerto Rico and the United  
States would remain the same, but Puerto Rico would be authorized to draft and  
approve its own Constitution, guaranteeing a republican form of government. The 
Constitution of Puerto Rico was ratified by the United States Congress and      
subsequently approved by the President of the United States. Puerto Rico is a   
self-governing commonwealth in association with the United States. The United   
States and the Commonwealth share a common defense, market and currency. Puerto 
Rico exercises virtually the same control over its internal affairs as any of   
the fifty states of the United States. However, it differs from the states in   
its relationship with the United States federal government. The people of       
Puerto Rico are citizens of the United States but do not vote in national       
elections (they can only vote in local (Puerto Rico) elections). The people of  
the Commonwealth are represented in Congress by a Resident Commissioner who has 
a voice in the House of Representatives and limited voting power. The chief of  
state of the Commonwealth is the President of the United States. The head of    
government is an elected Governor. There are two legislative chambers: the      
House of Representatives and the Senate. Most federal taxes, except those such  
as Social Security taxes, are not levied in Puerto Rico. No federal income tax  
is collected from Puerto Rico residents on income sourced in Puerto Rico,       
except for certain federal employees who are subject to taxes on their          
salaries. Income earned by Puerto Rico residents from sources outside of Puerto 
Rico, however, is subject to federal income tax.                                

  Geographic Location and Demography. Puerto Rico is the fourth largest of the
Caribbean islands and is located approximately 1,600 miles Southeast of New     
York. It is approximately 100 miles long and 35 miles wide.                     

  According to United States Census Bureau estimates, the population of Puerto
Rico reflected a decrease to approximately 3,548,000 as of 2014, according to a 
United States Census Bureau estimate, compared to 3,725,789 in 2010.            

Changes in population have had, and may continue to have, an impact on    
economic growth and on the growth of tax revenues. Continued reductions in      
population, particularly of working age individuals, may have an adverse effect 
on tax and other government revenues that will not be entirely offset by        
reductions in government expenses in the short and medium term. In addition,    
the average age of the population of Puerto Rico is increasing, partly due to a 
reduction in birth rate, but primarily as a result of the migration of younger  
persons to the United States mainland. This may increase the demand for health  
and other services upon the Commonwealth, and the cost to the Commonwealth of   
providing such services, thus imposing limitations on the Commonwealth's        
ability to achieve a balanced budget and improve its financial condition.       

   Relationship with the United States. While Puerto Rico has authority over its
internal affairs, the United States controls interstate trade, foreign relations
and commerce, customs administration, control of air, land and sea, immigration 
and emigration, nationality and citizenship, currency, maritime laws, military  
service, military bases, army, navy and air force, declaration of war,          
constitutionality of laws, jurisdictions and legal procedures, treaties, radio  
and television communications, agriculture, mining and minerals, highways,      
postal system, social security, and other areas generally controlled by the     
federal government in the United States. Puerto Rican institutions control      
internal affairs unless U.S. law is involved, as in matters of public health and
pollution. Puerto Rico also lacks certain assignation of some revenues reserved 
for the states.                                                                 

Economy. The Commonwealth has established policies and programs directed  
principally at developing the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy 
and expanding and modernizing the Commonwealth's infrastructure. Domestic and   
foreign investment have been stimulated by selective tax exemptions,            
development loans, and other financial and tax incentives. Infrastructure       
expansion and modernization have been primarily financed by bonds and notes     
issued by the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities.         
Economic progress has been aided by significant increases in the levels of      
education and occupational skills of the Commonwealth's population.             

The economy of Puerto Rico is closely linked to the United States economy,
as most of the external factors that affect the local economy are determined by 
the policies and performance of the mainland economy. These external factors    
include exports, direct investment, the amount of federal transfer payments,    
the level of interest rates, the rate of inflation, and tourist expenditures.   
Puerto Rico's economy is closely linked to the United States economy.           
Approximately 71% of Puerto Rico's exports go to the United States and 42% of   
the imports come from the United States. In recent fiscal years, however, the   
performance of Puerto Rico's economy has not been consistent with the           
performance of the United States economy. Puerto Rico's economy entered a       
recession in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. Puerto Rico has a          
diversified economy with manufacturing and services comprising its principal    
sectors. In the last three decades, industrial development in Puerto Rico has   
been relatively capital intensive and dependent on skilled labor.               

Puerto Rico has experienced mixed results in the service sector, which    
includes wholesale and retail trade, utilities, transportation and warehousing, 
information, finance and insurance, real estate and rental, and certain         
services such as professional, scientific, technical, management,               
administrative, support, educational, health care, social, recreational,        
accommodation, food and other services. This sector has expanded in terms of    
income over the past decade, following the general trend of other               
industrialized economies, but with differences on the magnitudes of those       
changes. The development of the service sector has been positively affected by  
demand generated by other sectors of the economy, such as manufacturing and     
construction.                                                                   

 Tourism makes a significant contribution to economic activity. An estimated
$3.2 billion were spent by visitors in Puerto Rico during fiscal year 2013. San 
Juan is the largest homeport for cruise ships in the Caribbean and one of the   
largest homeports for cruise ships in the world. During the fiscal year 2012,   
the number of persons registered in tourist hotels increased 9.4% compared with 
fiscal year 2011, however, that number has stayed stagnant into Fiscal Year     
2015. Fiscal year 2015 saw record arrivals of cruise ship passengers with an    
impact on the local economy of approximately $1.6 million.                      

  The gross national product of Puerto Rico was $69.202 billion in fiscal year
2014, compared to $65.6 billion in fiscal year 2011. Aggregate personal income  
increased from $61.6 billion in fiscal year 2011 to $62.3 billion in fiscal     
year 2012, and personal income per capita increased from $16,611 in fiscal year 
2011 to $16,934 in fiscal year 2012.                                            

According to the Household Survey, during the first nine months of fiscal 
year 2015, total employment fell by 0.8% as compared to the same period for the 
prior fiscal year, and the unemployment rate averaged 13.1% compared to 14.7%   
for the same period of the prior fiscal year. The current unemployment rate in  
Puerto Rico, as of October 2015, is 11.6%.                                      

Debt, Revenues and Expenditures. Total assets and total liabilities of the
Commonwealth's primary government at June 30, 2012 amounted to $16.3 billion    
and $55.3 billion, respectively, for a net deficit of $39 billion, compared to  
a $33.7 billion net deficit at the beginning of 2014.                           

The Commonwealth had a net deficit of $47.2 billion in the governmental   
activities and a net deficit of $2.0 billion in the General Fund as of June 30,
2013, which has resulted from operating deficits over the last several years.   
The Commonwealth's high level of debt and the resulting required allocation of  
revenues to service this debt have contributed to these deficits and have       
adversely affected its credit ratings. The Commonwealth's expenses cover a range
of services. The largest expenses were for general government, education, public
housing and welfare, health, and public safety, which presented a combined      
increase of approximately $235.6 million when compared with prior fiscal year.  
In 2013, governmental activities' expenses exceeded program revenue by          
approximately $14.3 billion, resulting in the use of approximately $8.6 billion 
of general revenue and transfers from other funds (mostly taxes).               

 The Commonwealth's most recent projection is that it will close fiscal year
2015 with a budget deficit in the range of $531 million to $566 million, an     
amount that, when adjusted for actual tax refunds paid in this fiscal year in   
excess of the reserve included in the budget for fiscal year 2015, increases    
the deficit to a range of $705 million to $740 million.                         

As of March 31, 2015, the Commonwealth had outstanding a total of $22.604 
billion aggregate principal amount of bonds and notes issued or guaranteed by   
the Commonwealth or payable from General Fund appropriations, equivalent to     
approximately 33% of the Commonwealth's gross national product for fiscal year  
2014 ($69.202 billion - preliminary). Debt service for fiscal year 2016 on      
these bonds and notes payable from the General Fund ($1.970 billion) represents 
approximately 21% of the General Fund budget for fiscal year 2015 ($9.565       
billion). Maximum annual debt service on these bonds and notes ($2.350 billion  
in fiscal year 2028) represents approximately 25% of the General Fund budget    
for fiscal year 2015.                                                           

The total outstanding public sector debt of the Commonwealth, its         
instrumentalities, and municipalities was $72.204 billion as of March 31, 2015, 
equivalent to approximately 104% of the Commonwealth's gross national product   
for fiscal year 2014.                                                           

As of October 2015, preliminary General Fund Revenues for the first ten   
months of fiscal year 2015 were approximately $7.335 billion, an increase of    
$61.6 million when compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, but    
$250.6 million less than the originally estimated revenues for the period.      

The Commonwealth's very high level of debt has contributed to significant 
budget deficits during the past several years, which deficits the Commonwealth  
has been required to finance, further increasing the amount of its debt. The    
Commonwealth's high level of debt, among other factors, has adversely affected  
its credit ratings and its ability to obtain financing at favorable interest    
rates.                                                                          

Ratings. As of October 2015, the credit ratings of the Commonwealth's     
general obligation bonds were lowered to "Caa3" by Moody's Investors Service    
("Moody's"), "CC" by Standard & Poor's Rating Services ("S&P"), and "CC" by     
Fitch Ratings ("Fitch"), each of which is non-investment grade. S&P, Moody's    
and Fitch each assigned a negative outlook on the Commonwealth's ratings.       

  Any explanation concerning the significance of such ratings must be obtained
from the rating agencies. There is no assurance that any ratings will continue  
for any period of time or that they will not be revised or withdrawn.           

Credit Ratings and Liquidity. The liquidity of the Commonwealth has been  
adversely affected by the ratings downgrades described above, by the            
significant increase in credit spreads for obligations of the Commonwealth and  
its instrumentalities, by the limited market access experienced by the          
Commonwealth and its instrumentalities during the second half of 2013, and by a 
significant reduction of liquidity in the local Puerto Rico capital markets.    
Under current market conditions, in part as a result of the recent ratings      
downgrades, the Commonwealth may have limited capital market access. If the     
Commonwealth does not have sufficient access to the capital markets or          
alternative sources of financing to satisfy its liquidity needs, it may not be  
able to honor all of its obligations as they come due.                          

 Given the recent liquidity issues faced by the Commonwealth, it has hired a
U.S.-based consulting firm to perform a liquidity analysis of the Commonwealth, 
assist with the implementation of measures to improve cash management and       
forecasting procedures, and provide assistance to the Puerto Rico Treasury      
Department (the "Treasury Department" or "Treasury") in the development of      
short and medium-term cash flow projections.                                    

Relationships with Creditors and Business Counterparties. Changes in the  
Commonwealth's credit ratings could affect its relationships with creditors and 
other business counterparties. For example, certain of the Commonwealth's       
short-term financings, variable rate debt obligations and mandatory tender      
bonds include provisions that permit the acceleration of such debt instruments  
based on the downgrade of the Commonwealth's ratings below investment grade.    
Moreover, the Commonwealth's interest rate exchange agreements include          
provisions that permit the counterparties to either request additional          
collateral or terminate the agreements based on the downgrade of the            
Commonwealth's ratings below investment grade. The Commonwealth recently        
optionally terminated certain of its interest rate exchange agreements and in   
connection therewith made aggregate termination payments of approximately $23.8 
million to a counterparty. To date, however, the Commonwealth has not been      
required to post collateral in connection with any of its interest rate         
exchange agreements, and the Commonwealth's counterparties have not accelerated 
any debt obligations or terminated any interest rate exchange agreements as a   
result of such downgrades. If the counterparties entitled to accelerate debt    
obligations or terminate the remaining interest rate exchange agreements        
exercise their respective rights, there is no assurance that the Commonwealth   
would be able to honor all such obligations as they come due.                   

  Local Issuances. It should be noted that the creditworthiness of obligations
issued by local Puerto Rican issuers may be unrelated to the creditworthiness   
of obligations issued by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and there is no       
obligation on the part of the Commonwealth to make payment on such local        
obligations in the event of default.                                            

 Many factors including national economic, social and environmental policies
and conditions, which are not within the control of the issuers of such bonds,  
could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of the  
Commonwealth and various agencies and political subdivisions thereof. The       
Sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other    
factors may affect the issuers of the bonds, the market value or marketability  
of such bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of such bonds acquired   
by certain trusts to pay interest on or principal of such bonds. The Puerto     
Rico bonds are susceptible to political, economic or regulatory factors         
affecting issuers of Puerto Rico municipal obligations. These include the       
possible adverse effects of certain Puerto Rico constitutional amendments,      
legislative measures, voter initiatives and other matters that are described.   

The information provided above is only a brief summary of the complex     
factors affecting the financial situation in Puerto Rico and is derived from    
sources that are generally available to investors and are believed to be        
accurate. No independent verification has been made as to the accuracy or       
completeness of any of the preceding information. It is based in part on        
information obtained from Commonwealth and local agencies in Puerto Rico or     
contained in Official Statements for various Puerto Rico obligations.           

                                                                    U-SECSUP0516

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Rediscover Unit Trusts
Make American infrastructure great again!
The preferred opportunity (PFOP)




Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
This trust is concentrated in bonds of issuers in the health care sector. The ability of health care issuers, such as hospitals and hospital systems, to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor’s rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select “Understanding Ratings” under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody’s at www.moodys.com and select “Rating Methodologies” under Research and Ratings on the homepage.

An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
This trust is concentrated in bonds of issuers in the health care sector. The ability of health care issuers, such as hospitals and hospital systems, to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, government regulation, cost of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid).
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bond in the trust and the value of the units.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.

LIQUIDATION PRICE  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units. This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation and development fee. This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
OFFER PRICE Represents the net asset value per unit plus any applicable organization costs and sales charges. This is the regular public offering price per unit paid to purchase units. This price is often subject to certain sales charge discounts described in a trust prospectus.
NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) Represents the value per unit of a trust's portfolio securities and other assets reduced by trust expenses and other liabilities, including remaining organization costs, deferred sales charges and creation and the development fee.This page contains historical pricing or historical income distributions information for the unit trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes. Please contact your financial advisor for tax information.This information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state, or other jurisdiction to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.

In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

Quality Municipal Income Trust, 20+ Year (QUAL0196)
	
	




Objective
Take advantage of federal tax-exempt investments through a convenient and efficient way of purchasing a professionally selected and diversified portfolio of quality municipal bonds. The Trust is a long-term portfolio1 that offers tax-exempt federal income with the potential for a higher yield than a portfolio holding insured municipal bonds. The bonds in the portfolio are generally not insured, and, if rated, have credit ratings of at least A- by Standard & Poor's or at least A3 by Moody's as of the deposit date.2 The Trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income3 and to preserve capital. The Trust invests in a portfolio of tax-exempt municipal bonds. 




1 Due to the nature of municipal bonds, there is a risk that a bond may be called before maturity, potentially below it's par value, and investors may be unable to reinvest their principal at the same rate of return.
2 Each bond’s rating may change after its inclusion in the Trust. 
3 A portion of your interest income may be subject to state or local taxes.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened.

A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
OFFER PRICE Represents the net asset value per unit plus any applicable organization costs and sales charges. This is the regular public offering price per unit paid to purchase units. This price is often subject to certain sales charge discounts described in a trust prospectus.
NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) Represents the value per unit of a trust's portfolio securities and other assets reduced by trust expenses and other liabilities, including remaining organization costs, deferred sales charges and creation and the development fee.This page contains historical pricing or historical income distributions information for the unit trust listed above. It should not be used for federal or state tax purposes. Please contact your financial advisor for tax information.This information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state, or other jurisdiction to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer. A trust that contains a state name in the trust name is generally available for sale only to investors in that state. The information shown may relate to a trust that is no longer offered to the public. In such a case, this information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy units of the trust. 





1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. 
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A portion of your interest may be subject to state and local taxes.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.
Please see the information supplement for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.

These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.

Quality Municipal Income Trust, 10-20 Year (QMLM0083)
	
		





Objective
Quality Municipal Income Trust, 10-20 Year Series,  invests in a portfolio of tax-exempt municipal bonds. The trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income1 and to preserve capital. 

You can help build a better America with an investment in municipal bonds (bonds issued by municipalities to finance projects such as schools, roads and hospitals). Through one convenient investment in a unit investment trust, you can own a defined, diversified basket of municipal bonds.

Take advantage of federal tax-exempt investments through a convenient and efficient way of purchasing a professionally selected and diversified portfolio of quality municipal bonds. The trust seeks to offer tax-exempt federal income with the potential for higher yield than a portfolio holding insured municipal bonds. The bonds in the portfolio are generally not insured, and are rated at least A- by Standard & Poor's or rated at least A3 by Moody's as of the deposit date.2
1 A portion of your interest income may be subject to state or local taxes.
2 Due to the nature of municipal bonds, there is a risk that a bond may be called before maturity, potentially below the par value of the bond, and investors may be unable to reinvest their principal at the same rate of return

Diversification does not ensure a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The trust may realize gains when a municipal bond is sold, is called or matures and unitholders may incur a tax liability from time to time.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust is concentrated in higher education bonds, which are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants and endowments. Higher education bond issuers face problems related to declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and government legislation or regulation.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.

This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The trust may realize gains when a municipal bond is sold, is called or matures and unitholders may incur a tax liability from time to time.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust is concentrated in higher education bonds, which are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants and endowments. Higher education bond issuers face problems related to declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and government legislation or regulation.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specifi c securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall. The trust may realize gains when a municipal bond is sold, is called or matures and unitholders may incur a tax liability from time to time.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
The trust is concentrated in higher education bonds, which are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants and endowments. Higher education bond issuers face problems related to declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and government legislation or regulation.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. In particular, Qualified Bonds may be redeemed approximately three years after issuance to the extent an issuer has unexpended bond sale proceeds.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
Should the issuer of a Build America Bond or Qualified Bond fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. In particular, Qualified Bonds may be redeemed approximately three years after issuance to the extent an issuer has unexpended bond sale proceeds.
Investments in a trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.
Should the issuer of a Build America Bond or Qualified Bond fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.
