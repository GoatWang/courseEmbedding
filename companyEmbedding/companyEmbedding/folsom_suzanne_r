PITTSBURGH, Feb. 3, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:   X) Chief Executive Officer Mario Longhi today announced the appointment of Suzanne Rich Folsom to the position of general counsel and senior vice president – governmental affairs.  Folsom, who will be based at U. S. Steel's Pittsburgh headquarters, will report to Longhi and join the company's executive management team.  
(Photo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140203/NE57280 )
She will be responsible for the company's legal and regulatory matters, including corporate governance and compliance, and will provide executive leadership to the company's worldwide public policy and governmental-affairs initiatives.  
"I am delighted to welcome Suzanne to U. S. Steel, where her extensive expertise in corporate and international law, ethics and governance, compliance and government affairs will add immediate value," Longhi said. "Suzanne has an impressive history of achievement throughout her legal career.  Her demonstrated leadership and business transformation experience make her another excellent addition to the seasoned executive team now developing and leading the Carnegie initiatives that will usher in a new era of profitability for our company."  
Prior to joining U. S. Steel, Folsom served as executive vice president, general counsel and chief compliance officer of ACADEMI LLC, a leading global innovative security solutions provider to the federal government and commercial clients, where she transformed the legal and compliance program, setting a gold standard for that industry.  
Previously, she served as deputy general counsel and chief regulatory and compliance officer for American International Group where she established and implemented best-in-class regulatory and compliance processes, helping to remediate the company's material weaknesses. Folsom and her team were widely praised by international regulators for their extraordinary efforts during a time of heightened concern over the global financial crisis. She also held the position of counselor to the president of the World Bank Group, and director of its Department of Institutional Integrity, where she was charged with responsibility for leading the bank's global anti-corruption initiatives.  In addition, Folsom previously practiced law with O'Melveny & Myers and Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.  
Recently, Corporate Secretary Magazine awarded Folsom its 2013 Governance Professional of the Year Award; the Ethisphere Institute named her to its 2013 Attorneys Who Matter-Top General Counsel list; and Inside Counsel magazine recognized her as one of the 2013 Top 100 Female In-House Counsel. She serves on the Advisory Board of Global Leaders in Law, the Association of Corporate Counsel's WMACCA-Global Issues Forum Committee, is Co-chair of Inside Counsel magazine's 2014 Women, Influence, Power in the Law Conference, and remains actively involved in a number of charitable endeavors.   
Folsom is a graduate of Duke University and Georgetown University Law Center.
