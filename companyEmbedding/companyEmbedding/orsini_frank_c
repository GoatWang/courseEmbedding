Orsini, Frank C
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Orsini Estates, Frank C carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Orsini Estates, Frank C currently holds license 2101109056 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Orsini Estates, Frank C



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Title:


                    Count-down-to-christmas-scene-device                





                United States Patent Application 20050281028            

                Kind
                Code:
            

                A1            













Abstract:

            The “Count-Down-to-Christmas-Scene-Device” is a battery operated (or cord plug-in) Christmas Scene designed to technically count down the “Twelve Days TO Christmas” (12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, “Merry Christmas!!”. The concept is an electrical countdown using numbered Christmas Lights (or the numbers are displayed counting down on an LCD screen) somewhere in a Christmas Scene/design” (on a tree beside a house, on the house—as in lights decorated on the roof or lawn, on a pole or “North Pole”, etc). Each numbered Christmas Light will light up according to the number of days left till Christmas. The numbered Christmas Lights are tied to a “TIMER”, which is tied to the Atomic Clock for perfect time or a “pre-set” clock timer. This will enable the “Count-Down-to-Christmas-Scene-Device” to work perfectly. The “Count-Down-to-Christmas-Scene-Device” may/can also play Christmas songs.

Description:

FIELD and BACKGROUND OF INVENTION There are many December devices/calendars (December 1-31) to anticipate Christmas day, December 25th, as well as other events during the year: New Years Eve, birthdays, Easter, etc. Put simply, this invention was thought of as a way for children and adults alike as a way to enhance their anticipation of the arrival on Christmas with lights and flair. There are many “calendars” out there for the month of December, but nothing that specifically counts down the “12 days TO Christmas”. Some devices/calendars have “pop-out” windows/boxes which reveal a treat or a story. Some use candy. Some are configured with the standard columns and rows like a regular calendar. Some have individual pieces to mark the days or numbers and yet some are blank for individuals to mark the days themselves. The 12 Days before Christmas during the Christmas season represent and always mark the “highest” time of anticipation to Christmas day. As you will see, the “Countdown-to-Christmas-Scene-Device” is a new and improved CHRISTMAS HOLIDAY anticipation product and far superior to the prior art of holiday calendars. Further, all prior art is based on manual participation of a person (open set squares, write on a board, move pieces or objects). The Count-Down-to-Christmas-Scene-Device uses modern technology, is electrical (plug-in or battery operated) has lights and uses a pre-set or the atomic clock. U.S. Pat. No. 6,581,310—Jun. 24, 2003, (Holiday Countdown) consists of fabric with ribbons that attach to it marking the days to which any holiday, birthday or special event is coming up. The elongated fabric also comprises spaces for all days of December, as well all months for the purpose of marking any holiday, birthday or special event. The ribbons are also tied to a treat or plush toy. U.S. Pat. No. 4,975,061—Dec. 4, 1990 (Child's Holiday Calendar). This uses a calendar matrix, along with candy and visual markers. It is also specifically for children prior to their ability to read. U.S. Pat. No. 5,058,296—Oct. 22, 1991 (Calendar). This is an Advent calendar with “steps” that an individual moves a “piece” along the pathway marking each day. It also has spaces for “gifts” at certain days. U.S. Pat. No. 5,257,940—Nov. 2, 1993. (Child's educational Calendar). This invention has columns and rows that relate to a normal calendar, and is intended to help children understand “days” and “weeks”. U.S. Pat. No. 5,813,539—Sep. 29, 1998. (Calendar Organizer). This invention is for identifying important events, holidays, vacations, bill payments, etc.SUMMERY OF INVENTION Undoubtedly, you can picture what was previously stated and the uniqueness of the product; however, in summery, the Count-Down-to-Christmas-Scene-Device uses modern technology to count down the 12 days TO Christmas like no other product. The prior art is made of paper or another form of fabric, has spaces for all or a portion of the days of a month. But most off all, they don't single out the 12 days TO Christmas. Non, not Patent# 6,581,310 or 4,975,061 or 5,058,296 or 5,257,940 or 5,813,539. Combined with the use of LED's or LCD's, this product separates itself from all other prior products and stands alone in counting down the 12 days TO Christmas. This invention is for the enjoyment of adults, children and families to enjoy the Christmas Holiday.
