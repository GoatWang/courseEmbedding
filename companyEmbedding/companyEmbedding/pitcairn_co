      Pitcairn Island Honey
    








      Pitcairn Island
      Pure Honey 
      "With all the natural sweetness of tropical fruits and flowers"




Pitcairn Island
        Pure honey is packaged in 250g jars. The price per jar is NZ$15.00
        (minimum order 2 jars). There is a charge of NZ$3.00 packaging per
        order + postage as listed below

        In May 1998, the UK Government aid agency, the Department for
        International Development, funded an apiculture programme for Pitcairn
        which included training for Pitcairn's bee keepers and a detailed
        analysis of the disease status of Pitcairn bees and honey.  As a
        result, Pitcairn is now able to export honey products to New Zealand
        and beyond.

        Pitcairn has one of the most disease free bee populations of anywhere
        in the world and the honey produced is of an exceptionally high
        quality.  The apicultural scientist conducting the project, also
        found that Pitcairn bees were a particularly placid variety and within
        a short time, was able to work with them wearing minimal
        protection.  It would therefore seem that the export of live Queen
        bees is another potential earner for the Pitcairn Islanders. The
        numbers of hives on the island is now around 60, with potential for
        perhaps 5 times that amount.

        The rich and intense fruitiness of Pitcairn's honey is attributed to
        the nectar from the Mango, Lata, Passion Flower, Guava and Roseapple
        flowers found in abundance on Pitcairn.

PITCAIRN'S
FIRST PHONE/FAX CARDS

~~~~~~~~  
Trial issue   ~~~~~~~~


The Planet 1 INMARSAT M satellite communications system was
installed
on Pitcairn in 1998.  Along with the installation, there was
the
release
of this trial phone/fax cards.


 


 


 



 

The Planet 1 INMARSAT M satellite communications system has
already
proved to be cheaper than the previous system.  The card
fax/phone
system has halved the price of calls from NZD 15.00 per minute to NZD
7.50
per minute.  A very welcomed and exciting change for the
islanders
and the Pitcairn Island Administration!


 



 


 

 This trial set of phone/fax cards is an extremely
attractive
looking
set.  The four cards are identical to the Views of Christian's
Cave
stamp issue which was painted by Lesley Harraway.  As Lesley's
past
and present stamp issues have depicted Pitcairn so well and have been
the
most popular stamp issues among customers, it seemed fitting to produce
the first phone/fax cards with a set of her paintings.


 


 


 



 

The values of the cards are (NZD) $5.00, $10.00,
$20.00,
$50.00,
as illustrated here.  There have been 1000 trial sets
produced.

This set of phone cards is now available through our
Philatelic
Bureau.
Price NZ$75.00 + postage




  Under the shadows of
Gannet's Ridge is the yawning cave in which Fletcher

Christian
is said to have
spent
many hours meditating and watching for

ships. 
Although
Christian's
Cave is now clearly visible from the sea, it was

previously
concealed by vines
and lofty trees whcih would have afforded

Christian
a safe
retreat.

    Precious metal coins will be presented complete with a Certificate of
    Authenticity.

Pitcairn Island Propolis Tincture




Pitcairn
Island Propolis Tincture
25ml/0.8floz Dietary
Supplement


Pitcairn Island Propolis comes
from unique trees on the island that use resins to protect their young
buds.

Pitcairn
Honey Bees gather and carry these tree resins to their hives
where they make Propolis. The Honey Bees use the Propolis to seal and
sterilize hives, protecting them from bacterial, viral and fungal
infections.

Pitcairn
Island beekeepers recognize the beneficial effects of
propolis. They collect this clean fresh substance and dissolve it in
alcoholic beverages so as to extract the good natural immune supporting
properties held within the honey bee Propolis.

The
Pitcairn Island beekeepers let the solution mature over many weeks
and then filter the liquid to produce a very rare and exclusive
Propolis Tincture.

The price per bottle is NZ$15.00 (minimum order 2 bottles). There is a
charge
of NZ$2.00 packaging per order + postage
as listed below

Payment will be taken at time of ordering, but please be aware that due

from the remote island of Pitcairn, your Propolis Tincture may take 2
to 5
months to arrive.
However, your patience will be rewarded with this unique product!

      Pitcairn Island Honey
    








      Pitcairn Island
      Pure Honey 
      "With all the natural sweetness of tropical fruits and flowers"




Pitcairn Island
        Pure honey is packaged in 250g jars. The price per jar is NZ$15.00
        (minimum order 2 jars). There is a charge of NZ$3.00 packaging per
        order + postage as listed below

        In May 1998, the UK Government aid agency, the Department for
        International Development, funded an apiculture programme for Pitcairn
        which included training for Pitcairn's bee keepers and a detailed
        analysis of the disease status of Pitcairn bees and honey.  As a
        result, Pitcairn is now able to export honey products to New Zealand
        and beyond.

        Pitcairn has one of the most disease free bee populations of anywhere
        in the world and the honey produced is of an exceptionally high
        quality.  The apicultural scientist conducting the project, also
        found that Pitcairn bees were a particularly placid variety and within
        a short time, was able to work with them wearing minimal
        protection.  It would therefore seem that the export of live Queen
        bees is another potential earner for the Pitcairn Islanders. The
        numbers of hives on the island is now around 60, with potential for
        perhaps 5 times that amount.

        The rich and intense fruitiness of Pitcairn's honey is attributed to
        the nectar from the Mango, Lata, Passion Flower, Guava and Roseapple
        flowers found in abundance on Pitcairn.

My Favourite place on Pitcairn.

This is the first ever story book

"Teaching
the 6 children of Pitcairn about place names on Pitcairn was a bit of a
challenge. To make it all fun each of the five children (aged 5-11)
plus a 16 year old, chose a favourite place name as their theme."

Pitcairn Island Flag


The
Flag of Pitcairn Island



Pitcairn
Flags can be
purchased in two sizes:




Large (1800mm x 900mm) NZ$130.00 + postage





Small (900mm x 450mm) NZ$65.00 + postage







Pitcairn
Island's flag is a Blue Ensign with the island's Coat of Arms
in the fly. The design was suggested by the Pitcairn Island Council
in December 1980 and approved by HM The Queen in April 1984. The flag
was flown on Pitcairn for the first time in May 1984, during a visit by
the Governor the late Sir Richard Stratton.

The
British Blue Ensign, incorporating the Union Flag or Union Jack in the
hoist, indicates Pitcairn Island’s historical association with Great
Britain. 


The shield of the island's coat of arms features the anchor and bible
from HMS Bounty. 


The anchor represents the island’s maritime history and the bible
symbolises the island’s Christian heritage and the religious community
that evolved from it. 


The divided shield symbolises the island (green) rising out of the
Pacific Ocean (blue).


Surmounting the shield is a helmet crested with a Pitcairn Island
wheelbarrow carrying a flowering slip of miro (a local plant). The
wheelbarrow and plant symbolise the island's agriculture.


The description of Pitcairn's Coat of Arms, which was granted by Royal
Warrant dated 4th November 1969: "Azure on a Pile in base Vert
fimbriated Or a representation of the Bounty Bible proper and in base
of the Anchor of H.M.S. Bounty Or. And for the Crest on a Wreath Or and
Vert on a Mount Vert a representation of the Pitcairn Island
Wheelbarrow in front of a Slip of Miro leaved and fructed proper."
