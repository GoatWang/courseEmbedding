About Us
Our People Matter
meet our partners and associates »

In 1997, Gregory Smith, fresh out of college at North Carolina State University, was hired by Franklin Street Partners in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. At Franklin Street, Gregory teamed up with Mackay Salley who had been managing money for decades and taught Gregory all he could about investment management and client service. During that time, Gregory pursued and received his MBA from the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Together Gregory and Mackay co-managed the Franklin Street Trust Small Cap Fund.
After 7 years of working together, Gregory saw an opportunity to found his own firm in his hometown of Greensboro, North Carolina. It was not too long thereafter that Gregory asked Mackay to join him. What eventually became Smith, Salley & Associates gave Mackay and Gregory an opportunity to address a services gap they identified in the investment management industry. Gregory says it best:
Mackay and I started this business because so many in our industry have failed to put client’s needs in front of their own.  Too many advisors push products that clients do not need or understand.  Some wealth advisors prefer to impress with financial jargon, overly complex strategies, or frequent (often costly) tactical maneuvers. We wanted to be different. We offer easy to understand, customized solutions to complex problems that help our clients achieve the things they want most from their money: obtaining an independent retirement, educating the next generation, caring for aging parents, and creating legacies that last.
At Smith Salley, we’ve assembled the experienced and trusted team you need. And, importantly for you, we’ve assembled your team in an independent, fee-only practice that squarely aligns our interests and incentives with your interests.

Today's financial landscape can be confusing. We believe both the regulatory structure and Wall Street have made it this way. In our opinion, looking at recent history, Wall Street is not in the advice business, as most investors think. Instead, Wall Street is in the business of manufacturing and selling products.

Customized Financial Solutions 

At Smith, Salley & Associates, we know that when it comes to choosing an investment advisor, our clients want a firm that can deliver more than standard investment advice. Our clients' situations often demand creativity and thoughtful reflection to design advice that serves both the present situation without sacrificing the future.

For individuals & institutions
Wealth management— simplified.
We are in this business because many advisors in our industry have failed to put their client’s needs in front of their own.  People have lost trust in financial advisors because they push products clients don’t need. They try to impress clients with financial jargon and overly complex strategies, rather than develop a successful advisor/client relationship.
At Smith, Salley & Associates, we believe in offering easy to understand, customized solutions that help our clients achieve the things they want most from their money: obtaining a stable retirement, protecting their hard earned dollars through uncertain times, educating the next generation, caring for aging parents, and creating legacies that last.
