 Paul Mitchell | Forever Blonde – Alex Rooke












































































						Alex Rooke					

 














Alex Rooke / November 5, 2016

Paul Mitchell | Forever Blonde


Tweet
I have been on the hunt for a shampoo and conditioner that will enhance my natural blonde hair colour for as long as I can remember. Whenever it gets to winter my hair starts to become darker in colour as it resembles more of a brass-y tone rather than a blonde. This is one of the things I hate the most about the winter but I have now found the solution.
The other day Paul Mitchell kindly sent me some of their products for blonde hair. The lovely people at Paul Mitchell sent me the Platinum Blonde Shampoo, the Forever Blonde Conditioner and the Forever Blonde Dramatic Repair. I was shocked when this came through the post as I was  only expecting samples but instead they sent me the full size product to try and review.
 
  
 
To use these products, you simply use the shampoo and conditioner how you would use any other shampoo and conditioner. However, the Forever Blonde Dramatic repair with KerActive Damage Recovery, you spray onto towel-dried hair and comb through. You can then dry and style your hair as normal. This product helps treat fragile blonde hair and restore the health as well. The conditioner also does sort of the same thing except you wash that out normally.
I am really impressed with these products as they have made my hair feel healthier and look more blonde again which is something that is important to me especially as I am not keen on the idea of dying my hair. I think this is a cheaper alternative which everyone with blonde hair, whether dyed or not should definitely true this product before they resort to dying it again as it keeps the colour looking healthier for longer.
 
Platinum Blonde Shampoo | £13.50
Forever Blonde Conditioner | £16.25
Forever Blonde Dramatic Repair | £16.25
