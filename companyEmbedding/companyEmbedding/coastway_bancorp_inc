	EXPLANATORY NOTE






	        Coastway Bancorp, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Company"), was formed to serve as the stock holding company for Coastway Community
	Bank (the "Bank") as part of its conversion from the mutual to the stock form of ownership. Prior to January 14, 2014, the Bank was 100% owned by Coastway Bancorp, LLC (the "LLC") and
	the LLC was 100% owned by Coastway Bancorp, MHC (the "MHC"). Accordingly, financial and other information of the MHC, the Company's predecessor is included in this annual report for 2013. The
	MHC was formed in February, 2013. For periods prior to 2013, the financial and other information of the Bank is included in this annual report.













	Forward Looking Statements






	        This
	annual report contains certain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements
	concerning plans, objectives, future events or performance and assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact. Forward-looking statements may be identified by
	reference to a future period or periods or by use of forward-looking terminology such as "anticipates," "believes," "expects," "intends," "may," "plans," "pursue," "views" and similar terms or
	expressions. Various statements contained in Item 7"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," including, but not limited to,
	statements related to management's views on the banking environment and the economy, competition and market expansion opportunities, the interest rate environment, credit risk and the level of future
	non-performing assets and charge-offs, potential asset and deposit growth, future non-interest expenditures and non-interest income growth, and borrowing capacity are forward-looking statements. The
	Company wishes to caution readers that such forward-looking statements reflect numerous assumptions and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may adversely affect the Company's future
	results. The following important factors, among others, could cause the Company's results for subsequent periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made herein:
	(i) changes in interest rates and changes in the duration of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities could negatively impact net interest income; (ii) changes in the
	business cycle and downturns in the local, regional or national economies, including deterioration in the local real estate market, could negatively impact credit and/or asset quality and result in
	credit losses and increases in the Company's allowance for loan losses and/or reduce valuations of foreclosed properties and real estate held for sale; (iii) changes in consumer spending could
	negatively impact the Company's credit quality and financial results; (iv) increasing competition from larger regional and out-of-state banking organizations as well as non-bank providers of
	various financial services could adversely affect the Company's competitive position within its market area and reduce demand for the Company's products and services; (v) deterioration of
	securities markets could adversely affect the value or credit quality of the Company's assets and the availability of funding sources necessary to meet the Company's liquidity needs;
	(vi) changes in technology could adversely impact the Company's operations and increase technology-related expenditures; (vii) increases in employee compensation and benefit expenses
	could adversely affect the Company's financial results; (viii) changes in laws and regulations that apply to the Company's business and operations, including
	without limitation, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act") and the additional regulations that
	will be forthcoming as a result thereof, could adversely affect the Company's business environment, operations and financial results; (ix) changes in accounting standards, policies and
	practices, as may be adopted or established by the regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") could
	negatively impact the Company's financial results; (x) our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;

	(xi) future
	regulatory compliance costs, including any increase caused by new regulations imposed by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau; and (xii) some or all of the risks and
	uncertainties described in "Risk Factors" contained in Item 1A could be realized, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition and results of
	operation. Therefore, the Company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking information and statements.






	Coastway Bancorp, Inc.





	        Coastway Bancorp, Inc. is a Maryland corporation and owns 100% of the common stock of Coastway Community Bank. On January 14,
	2014, the Company completed its initial public offering of common stock in connection with the mutual-to-stock conversion of Coastway Bancorp, MHC, selling 4,827,125 shares of common stock at $10.00
	per share (contributing $300,000 in cash and 122,054 shares of common stock to Coastway Cares Charitable Foundation II) and raising $48.3 million of gross proceeds. Since the completion
	of the initial public offering, the Company has not engaged in any significant business activity other than owning the common stock of and having deposits in the Bank. At December 31, 2016,
	Coastway Bancorp, Inc. had total consolidated assets of $644.2 million, total consolidated deposits of $447.3 million, and total consolidated stockholders' equity of
	$68.6 million. Our executive offices are located at One Coastway Blvd, Warwick, Rhode Island 02886. Our telephone number at this address is (401) 330-1600.






	Coastway Community Bank





	        Coastway Community Bank is a Rhode Island chartered savings bank headquartered in Warwick, Rhode Island. Coastway Community Bank was originally
	organized in 1920 as the Telephone Workers Credit Union, a Rhode Island credit union, and later we changed our name to Coastway Credit Union. In 2000, Coastway Credit Union merged with Ocean State
	Community Credit Union, also located in Rhode Island. In 2009, in order to give us greater business lending authority, Coastway Credit Union converted to a Rhode Island chartered mutual savings bank
	and changed its name to Coastway Community Bank. In 2013, we reorganized into the mutual holding company structure by forming Coastway Bancorp, MHC, a Rhode Island chartered mutual holding company
	which was eliminated in January, 2014 when we completed our initial public offering.




	        We
	provide financial services to individuals, families and businesses throughout Rhode Island from our nine banking offices located in Providence County and Kent County, Rhode Island.
	Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in
	one- to four-family residential real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, commercial real estate loans, U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans and, to a lesser extent,
	commercial business loans, commercial construction loans and consumer loans. We sell in the secondary market the majority of the fixed-rate conforming one- to four-family residential real estate loans
	that we originate, and depending on market conditions, we may also sell the guaranteed portions of SBA loans that we originate. We offer a variety of deposit accounts to consumers and small
	businesses, including certificate of deposit accounts, savings accounts, demand deposit accounts, money market accounts and club accounts. We utilize national market certificates of deposit and
	advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston both to fund loan growth and for additional liquidity. We also offer online and mobile banking services. Our website address is www.coastway.com.
	Information on our website is not incorporated into this annual report and should not be considered part of this annual report.






	Market Area





	        We conduct our operations from our main office and nine full-service banking offices in Rhode Island. Our primary deposit market includes the
	areas surrounding our banking offices in Providence and Kent Counties, Rhode Island. Our primary lending market includes Providence and Kent Counties,

	Table of Contents





	greater
	Rhode Island and nearby communities in the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts. However, we occasionally make loans secured by properties located outside of our primary lending market,
	usually to borrowers with whom we have an existing relationship and who have a presence within our primary market.




	        Rhode
	Island is a relatively well-developed state that has a wide range of industries. Rhode Island's historical economy was based on industries such as textiles, jewelry, silverware,
	metals/machinery and footwear/rubber products. The access to the Atlantic Ocean resulted in the establishment of military bases and other military-related industries and employment. Over time
	manufacturing and other labor intensive industries have declined in Rhode Island and have been replaced by a more service-oriented economy. In recent decades, health care, financial services, defense
	industry, tourism and gambling have become more important segments of the local economy. Notable firms headquartered in Rhode Island include CVS Pharmacy, Textron, Hasbro and Amica Insurance. Rhode
	Island is also a center of higher education, with Brown University, the University of Rhode Island, Johnson & Wales University and Bryant University. The U.S. Navy has had a significant
	presence in the Newport area, through the Naval Station at Newport and the Naval Undersea Warfare Center.




	        Unemployment
	has stabilized in Rhode Island with unemployment rates of 5.0% for the entire state, 4.8% for Providence County and 4.0% for Kent County as compared to the national rate of
	4.7% as of December 2016. The median household income for 2011-2015 in Rhode Island was $57,000, in Providence County it was $50,000 and in Kent County it was $64,000, as compared to the national
	median of $53,000.




	        According
	to the latest U.S. Census estimates, Rhode Island reported a population of 1.1 million as of July 1, 2016, while the Providence metropolitan statistical area
	(which includes contiguous portions of Massachusetts and Connecticut), contained a total population of 1.6 million. Rhode Island recorded a 0.3% increase in population from April 1, 2010
	to July 1, 2016, and the Providence metropolitan statistical area also recorded a 0.2% increase in population. Providence County, the location of seven of our branch offices, had a population
	of 633,000 as of July 1, 2015 and recorded an increase in population of 1.1% from April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015. Kent County, the location of two of our branch offices, reported a
	population of 165,000 as of July 1, 2015 and recorded a slight population decrease of 0.8% over the same time period. The United States as a whole recorded an increase of 4.1% in total
	population from April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2015 and an increase of 4.7% in total population from April 15, 2010 to July 1, 2016.






	Competition





	        We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of
	financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as
	trust services and private banking. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies and credit
	unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies.




	        As
	of June 30, 2016 (the latest date for which information is available), our deposit market share was 1.36% for the State of Rhode Island, with 1.09% of total deposits in
	Providence County, Rhode Island and 5.54% in Kent County, Rhode Island respectively, making us the 8th largest out of 18 financial institutions in Providence County and the 7th largest
	out of 12 financial institutions in Kent County. We have been one of the top three SBA lenders in the State of Rhode Island in terms of dollars lent and number of loans originated for the last nine
	years.

	Lending Activities





	        Our principal lending activity is originating one- to four-family residential real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit,
	commercial real estate loans, SBA loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial business loans, commercial construction loans and consumer loans. We also sell in the secondary market the majority of the
	fixed-rate conforming one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, generally on a servicing-released, limited or no recourse basis, while retaining jumbo fixed-rate and
	adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to re-pricing of our loan portfolio. During 2016 and 2015, we purchased individual loans
	totaling $17.6 million and $56.7 million at a cost of $17.8 million and $57.4 million, respectively, of one- to four-family residential real estate loans from third party
	originators, which the Bank underwrote in accordance with the Bank's lending policy prior to purchase. In recent years, we have increased and, subject to market conditions and our asset-liability
	analysis, expect to continue to increase commercial real estate and commercial business lending. Depending on market conditions, we may also sell the guaranteed portions of SBA loans that we
	originate. We sold
	$4.2 million of SBA loans for a gain on sale of $328,000 in 2015. There were no sales of SBA loans during 2016.






	        Loan Portfolio Composition.




	    The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio, by type of loan at the dates
	indicated, excluding
	the carrying value of loans held for sale of $23.2 million, $19.0 million, $11.0 million, $8.6 million, and $13.6 million at December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014,

Fourth quarter 2016 net interest income increased $0.494 million, or 11.6%, to $4.7 million compared to the fourth quarter 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily a result of a $0.689 million increase in loan interest income due to growth in average loans of $76.6 million from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2016. Income before income taxes was $1.200 million against $1.023 million a year ago. Diluted earnings per share were $0.18 against $0.14 a year ago.

Net interest income for 2016 increased $2.8 million, or 18.2% to $18.4 million compared to 2015 net interest income of $15.6 million. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to the $17.5 million increase in average net interest-earning assets to $130.6 million for 2016, principally due to loan growth.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
