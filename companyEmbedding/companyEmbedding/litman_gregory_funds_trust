Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.

Overview
Managers
Performance
Fund Data
Fact Sheet
Commentary


	We couldn't find a core alternatives strategy that we liked, so we created one.

Risk-Management Goals
	Lower risk and lower volatility than the stock market


Inherently lower risk because of the nature of each manager's investment universe and/or because of the way in which each manager addresses risk (low risk of negative returns over any given one-year time period)

		Relatively low correlation to stock and bond market indexes


	Volatility in the range of 4% to 8%


		Risk control is intended to be a function of several factors including: the inherent risk level of the strategies; the risk sensitive nature of the managers; the skill of the managers; and the overall strategy diversification


Return Goals
	Strong absolute, relative and risk-adjusted returns over full market cycles 


		Managers can take advantage of the additional flexibility that comes from a multi-manager structure, and in some cases invest in ways that only accredited investors would usually have access to. For example, our managers can use leverage, portfolio concentration, and take advantage of less-liquid opportunities. Flexibility to take advantage of compelling opportunities that arise when valuations become severely depressed

		Litman Gregory may tactically alter each sub-advisor's allocation to take advantage of particularly compelling opportunities for a specific strategy or to further manage risk


Other key features:


		Highly competitive cost

		Transparent and understandable

		Highly experienced managers chosen for their specialized and demonstrated expertise, and for their complementary, low-correlation investment approaches. Each manager runs individualized sleeves for Litman Gregory (this is not a fund of funds).

		A mix of strategies and managers not available in a single publicly available mutual fund


The fund's role in a portfolio
	We consider the fund a substitute for a portion of a portfolio's exposure to traditional stocks and bonds. If the fund meets our goals, Litman Gregory believes that owning it as a core holding has the potential to offer returns that are as good as or better than the stock/bond mix from which it was funded, with less volatility and downside risk and added diversification.  There are no guarantees that the fund will meet our goals.

Target Manager Allocation: 16%Strategy: Long-Short Credit
 Read the full manager bio



			DCI’s strategies employ a systematic portfolio construction process underpinned by a proprietary, fundamental model of credit risk and valuation. DCI’s investment process is designed to exploit information gaps between credit and equity markets and other market inefficiencies to identify and capture mispricing at the individual asset level. The DCI Long-Short Credit Strategy is seeks to generate returns from idiosyncratic credit selection, as the strategy systematically curtails rate duration and credit beta exposure. Correlations to systematic market risks including high yield and equity market returns are expected to be minimal, and strategy returns are not expected to be correlated to the returns of other active strategies. The DCI Long-Short Credit Strategy is designed to perform in both low and high volatility environments although returns are expected to be higher in higher volatility environments.Read more


		 
 



			DoubleLine

			 



Jeffrey
					Gundlach




Target Manager Allocation: 23%Strategy: Opportunistic Income
 Read the full manager bio



			Gundlach and the DoubleLine team operate under the cardinal mandate of delivering superior risk–adjusted fixed–income returns. They seek to deliver positive absolute returns in excess of an appropriate aggregate fixed–income index with portfolio volatility that is similar to U.S. long–term treasury securities. Investment ideas employed by Gundlach and his team must offer an asymmetric, positively skewed risk–reward profile. As a result, a great deal of their analysis seeks to identify fixed–income securities that they believe offer greater potential payoff than potential loss under multiple scenarios. Ultimately, a combination of risk management, asset allocation, and security selection forms Gundlach’s investment process.Read more


		 
 



			FPA

			 



Steven

Mark Landecker




Target Manager Allocation: 17%Strategy: Contrarian Opportunity
 Read the full manager bio



			This strategy leads to investments that offer absolute rather than relative value with an objective of strong risk-adjusted returns. As absolute-return investors, the FPA team seeks genuine bargains rather than relatively attractive securities. The goal is to provide equity-like returns over longer periods (i.e., five to seven years) while seeking to preserve capital. Attention is directed toward those companies offering the best combination of such quality criteria as strong market share, good management, and high normalized return on capital. A company purchased might not look inexpensive, considering current earnings and return on capital; however, its valuation may reflect such conditions as a weak economy, an increase in raw material costs, a management misstep, or any number of other temporary conditions. The FPA team believes that price drops caused by such developments can, and often do, provide buying opportunities.

			The FPA team employs the broad mandate of the FPA contrarian strategy to invest across the capital structure, asset classes, market capitalization, industries and geographies using a wide variety of instruments.Read more


		 
 



			Loomis Sayles

Todd Vandam




Target Manager Allocation: 17%Strategy: Absolute-Return Fixed-Income
 Read the full manager bio



			The strategy’s absolute-return objective means that it is not managed relative to an index and that it attempts to achieve positive total returns over a full market cycle with relatively low volatility. The Loomis team pursues this objective by utilizing a flexible investment approach that allocates investments across a global range of investment opportunities related to credit, currencies, and interest rates, while employing risk management strategies to help mitigate downside risk. The team’s investment process employs both top-down (macro themes) and bottom-up (security selection) components and uses the resources of the entire Loomis Sayles infrastructure.Read more

Target Manager Allocation: 10%Strategy: Long-Short Equity
 Read the full manager bio



			Passport Capital seeks to achieve superior risk-adjusted returns through a combination of macroeconomic analysis, fundamental research, and quantitative tools. It employs top-down, macroeconomic analysis to identify durable, secular changes not reflected in asset prices. It conducts rigorous fundamental research in an attempt to identify individual securities that most effectively express the firm's investment views. Finally, the firm employs quantitative tools to construct portfolios aimed at delivering superior returns within specific risk and liquidity targets.Read more

			John Orrico, Todd Munn, Roger Foltynowicz, and Gregg Loprete are the portfolio managers responsible for the arbitrage strategy, which is the segment of the Alternative Strategies Fund’s assets managed by Water Island Capital, LLC.

			Investment Strategy: The Water Island team seeks to generate long-term returns with low correlation to the equity and bond markets. This objective is pursued by investing in equity and debt securities of companies that are impacted by corporate events such as mergers, acquisitions, restructurings, refinancings, recapitalizations, reorganizations, or other special situations.Read more

Dennis Bryan, Partner Rikard Ekstrand, Partner Frank Sustersic, CFA, Senior Portfolio Manager/Global Security Equity Analyst Richard Weiss, Senior Portfolio Advisor4 The following information replaces the first two paragraphs and the table that immediately follows the first paragraph on page 29 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: (Changes are in bold face and underline) Litman Gregory, not the Funds, is responsible for payment of the sub-advisory fees to the managers, each of whom is compensated monthly on the basis of the assets committed to its individual discretion. As of May 17, 2013, based on the assets of each Fund and the asset allocation targets, Litman Gregory pays fees to the sub-advisors as follows, which may change in the future because assets and allocations will fluctuate: Aggregate Annual Fee Rates Litman Fund Gregory Pays to Sub-Advisors Equity Fund 0.61% International Fund 0.52% Value Fund 0.65% Smaller Companies Fund 0.65% Focused Opportunities Fund 0.60% Alternative Strategies Fund 0.83% Through April 30, 2014, Litman Gregory has contractually agreed to waive a portion of its advisory fees for the Equity Fund, International Fund, Value Fund, Smaller Companies Fund and Focused Opportunities Fund as follows: for each of the Equity Fund, Value Fund, Smaller Companies Fund, and Focused Opportunities Fund, Litman Gregory has agreed to waive a portion of its advisory fees so that after paying all of the sub-advisory fees, the net advisory fee as a percentage of the respective Fund s daily net assets retained by Litman Gregory is 0.40%; and for the International Fund, Litman Gregory has agreed to waive a portion of its advisory fees so that after paying all of the sub-advisory fees, the net advisory fee as a percentage of the International Fund s daily net assets retained by Litman Gregory is 0.40% on the first $1 billion of the International Fund s assets and 0.30% for assets over $1 billion. Litman Gregory also voluntarily waives a portion of its advisory fee from time to time. Litman Gregory has agreed not to seek recoupment of any advisory fee waived. The following information replaces the three paragraphs and the table beginning on page 31 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Litman Gregory Masters Equity Fund Sub-Advisors The Equity Fund s six sub-advisors (but seven portfolio managers) emphasize different stockpicking styles and invest in stocks spanning a range of market capitalizations. Litman Gregory believes that during any given year certain stock-picking styles will generate higher returns than comparable market indexes, while others will lag. By including a variety of stock-picking styles in this single mutual fund, Litman Gregory believes that the variability and volatility of returns can be lessened. 45 Litman Gregory s strategy is to allocate the portfolio s assets among the managers who, based on Litman Gregory s research, are judged to be among the best in their respective style groups. The sub-advisors manage their individual portfolio segments by building a focused portfolio representing their highest-confidence stocks. Under normal conditions, the Equity Fund invests at least 80% of the Equity Fund s net assets in equity securities. This investment policy may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval, but shareholders would be given at least 60 days notice if any change occurs. Under normal conditions, each manager s portfolio segment typically includes a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 15 securities. A manager may occasionally hold more than 15 securities. Though the total number of securities the Equity Fund may hold at any point in time will vary, it is generally expected that the Equity Fund will hold between 60 and 100 securities. The target allocation of assets to the managers was designed with the specific objective of maintaining significant exposure to stocks of large- and mid-sized with a greater emphasis on U.S. domiciled. The following table provides a description of the Equity Fund s six sub-advisors and seven portfolio managers and their target levels of assets. Asset levels will fluctuate and it is at the discretion of Litman Gregory to re-balance the manager allocations. A detailed discussion of the management structure of the Equity Fund follows the table.

Davis Advisors manages equity funds using the Davis Investment Discipline. Davis Advisors conducts extensive research to try to identify businesses that possess characteristics it believes foster the creation of long-term value, such as proven management, a durable franchise and business model, and sustainable competitive advantages. Davis Advisors aims to invest in such businesses when they are trading at a discount to their intrinsic worth. Davis Advisors emphasizes individual stock selection and believes that the ability to evaluate management is critical. Davis Advisors routinely visits management teams at their places of business in order to gain insight into the relative value of different businesses. Such research, however rigorous, involves predictions and forecasts that are inherently uncertain. 67 The following is added to the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Equity Fund Managers following the description of Davis Selected Advisers, L.P. on page 32 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Pat English Andrew Ramer Fiduciary Management, Inc 100 E. Wisconsin Ave. Milwaukee, WI Pat English and Andrew Ramer are co-managers for the segment of the Equity Fund managed by Fiduciary Management, Inc. ( Fiduciary or FMI ). English joined Fiduciary in He is the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer and a partner of Fiduciary and is a member of the Portfolio Management Committee. English, along with Ramer, serves as the co-head of equity research, and they work with Fiduciary s analysts in vetting new research ideas. Prior to joining Fiduciary, English was a research analyst with Dodge & Cox from 1985 to Ramer joined Fiduciary in He is the Director of Research and a partner of Fiduciary and is a member of Fiduciary s Portfolio Management Committee. Ramer is also an analyst and covers a number of portfolio across a variety of industries. Prior to joining Fiduciary, Ramer was a research analyst with Bufka & Rodgers, LLC from 1998 to Fiduciary has been a subadvisor to the Equity Fund since Approximately 15% of the Equity Fund s assets are managed by Fiduciary. Fiduciary seeks to buy that have durable franchises (i.e., franchises that can survive difficult times) and whose common stock is trading below FMI s estimated intrinsic value of the company. FMI s investment process has always focused on evaluating three attributes of a company: the quality of the business model, the valuation, and the quality of management. Assessing the quality of a business is a primary research focus. Fiduciary defines a good business model as one that has a defensible niche and that can survive the ups and downs of a business cycle. In a defensible niche, FMI looks for with a high degree of recurring revenue, a well-established customer base, and/or sustainable competitive advantage. Typically, businesses that meet these characteristics are well-established with modest growth profiles. The FMI investment team will review 10 years of SEC filings and shareholder reports to understand a company s business model, and, where necessary, adjust a company s investment capital base for illegitimate write-offs (due to bad acquisitions, for example) to get a reliable picture of a company s historical return on invested capital ( ROIC ). Then the team will conduct a deeper analysis of the drivers of a company s ROIC such as revenue growth, margins, capital expenditure etc., going back at least 20 quarters. In addition, they will meet with and/or have conference calls with management of the company, as well as its suppliers, competitors, and customers. FMI s work on a company s business model and quality helps identify which valuation metrics (such as Price/Earnings (P/E), Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), Price/Sales (P/S), etc.) should be utilized for estimating a company s intrinsic value. This work is also valuable in assessing whether or not the business model has changed significantly over time, making historical comparisons irrelevant. If that is the case, FMI will analyze the trading of a stock based on various valuation metrics over a 10- to 20-year time period, relative to the broad market and its peers, across different economic 78 cycles, and with different underlying company fundamentals such as margins, top-line growth, competitive positioning, capital intensity of the business, etc. This historical valuation analysis may be supplemented by other valuation techniques, such as sum-of-the-parts analysis (i.e., valuing different pieces of a business separately) and valuation based on private- and public-market transaction data (for example, valuation multiples used in an acquisition), which may assume greater importance when historical comparisons are less relevant, such as where business models have changed or management strategy has shifted. FMI is not looking for a specific discount to its estimate of intrinsic value, but if its valuation analysis suggests that a stock is undervalued, in absolute terms and/or in relation to its future profitability (ROIC in this case), and downside risks are limited, then the stock is a strong candidate for purchase. In general, FMI does not aim to be precise with its valuation analysis and will come up with price-target ranges over three to five years. These price targets are generally within a narrow range, and they guide FMI on when to trim or sell a stock. FMI also focuses on areas that company management can control. Therefore, FMI will look at the backgrounds of management teams. This may involve: assessing their experience and track record; reviewing proxy statements to assess whether management compensation and incentives are in line with shareholder interests; evaluating past management decisions to assess whether or not those decisions enhanced shareholder value; and discussing with management their strategy and execution plan to assess the likelihood of meeting their stated goals and objectives. The following two paragraphs replace the first and the second paragraph of the description of Clyde S. McGregor of Harris Associates L.P. in the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Equity Fund Managers on page 33 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Clyde McGregor is the portfolio manager for one of the segments of the Equity Fund s assets managed by Harris Associates L.P. ( Harris ). McGregor is a Vice President and portfolio manager at Harris and currently manages the Oakmark Equity and Income Fund and the Oakmark Global Fund. He earned a B.A. degree from Oberlin College and an M.B.A. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. McGregor joined Harris in 1981 as an analyst with broad industry coverage across the market capitalization spectrum. He has 31 years of experience in the investment business. McGregor became a portfolio manager at Harris in Harris has been a sub-advisor to the Equity Fund since 2008, and McGregor has been a portfolio manager to the Equity Fund since Approximately 15% of the Equity Fund s assets are managed by McGregor, who employs Harris value investment philosophy and process. This investment philosophy is based upon the belief that, over time, a company s stock price converges with the company s intrinsic or true business value. By true business value, Harris means an estimate of the price a knowledgeable buyer would pay to acquire the entire business. In making its investment decisions, Harris uses a bottom-up approach focused on individual, rather than focusing on specific economic factors or specific industries. 89 The following is added to the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Equity Fund Managers following the description of Clyde S. McGregor of Harris Associates L.P. on page 33 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: William C. Nygren, CFA Harris Associates L.P. Two North LaSalle Street Suite 500 Chicago, IL Bill Nygren is the portfolio manager for one of the segments of the Equity Fund s assets managed by Harris. Nygren is a Vice President, portfolio manager and analyst at Harris and has managed The Oakmark Select Fund since its inception in 1996, The Oakmark Fund since April 2000 and The Oakmark Global Select Fund since its inception in He earned a B.S. degree in Accounting from the University of Minnesota and an M.S. degree in Finance from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He has been in the investment business since Nygren joined Harris in 1983 as an Investment Analyst and later served as Harris Director of Research from 1990 through Harris has been a sub-advisor to the Equity Fund since 2008, and Nygren has been a portfolio manager to the Equity Fund since Approximately 15% of the Equity Fund s assets are managed by Nygren, who employs Harris value investment philosophy and process. This investment philosophy is based upon the belief that, over time, a company s stock price converges with the company s intrinsic or true business value. By true business value, Harris means an estimate of the price a knowledgeable buyer would pay to acquire the entire business. In making its investment decisions, Harris uses a bottom-up approach focused on individual, rather than focusing on specific economic factors or specific industries. The chief consideration in the selection of stocks is the size of the discount of a company s stock price compared to the company s perceived true business value. In addition, Harris looks for with the following characteristics, although not all will have all of these attributes: free cash flows and intelligent investment of excess cash, earnings that are growing and are reasonably predictable, and a high level of management ownership in the company. Once Harris determines that a stock is selling at a significant discount and that the company has some of the aforementioned attributes, Harris generally will consider buying that stock for a strategy. Harris usually sells a stock when the price approaches its estimated worth. This means Harris sets specific buy and sell targets for each stock held in its clients discretionary accounts. Harris also monitors each holding and adjusts those price targets as warranted to reflect changes in a company s fundamentals. Harris attempts to manage some of the risks of investing in stocks of by purchasing stocks whose prices it considers low relative to the intrinsic values. In addition, Harris seeks with solid finances and proven records and continuously monitors each portfolio holding. 910 The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of the description of Sands Capital Management, LLC in the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Equity Fund Managers on page 34 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: The Sands Capital team manages approximately 17% of the assets of the Equity Fund. The team believes that over time stock price appreciation follows earnings growth. The investment objective is to identify that can sustain above-average earnings growth relative to the broader market, typically over the next three to five years. The team believes great investment ideas are rare and runs a concentrated portfolio of high-quality, seasoned, growing businesses across an array of attractive and growing business spaces. Independent research bottom-up and company focused is the cornerstone of the team s investment process. All research analyses and conclusions are internally generated using a variety of fundamental techniques and external data sources. The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of the description of Wells Capital Management, Inc. in the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Equity Fund Managers on page 35 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Approximately 13% of the Equity Fund's assets are managed by Weiss. He invests in stocks of small- and mid-sized that are undervalued either because they are not broadly recognized, are in transition, or are out of favor based on short-term factors. Weiss also has the flexibility to invest in the stocks of larger if in his opinion they offer the potential for better returns. In seeking attractively valued, Weiss focuses on with above-average growth potential that also exhibit some or all of the following: Low institutional investor ownership and low analyst coverage High-quality management Sustainable competitive advantage The following information replaces the four paragraphs and the table beginning on page 44 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Litman Gregory Masters Value Fund Sub-Advisors Litman Gregory s strategy is to allocate the portfolio s assets between the Value Fund s two portfolio managers who, based on Litman Gregory s research, are judged to be among the best in the value style. The portfolio managers manage their individual portfolio segments by building a focused portfolio representing their highest-confidence stocks. Under normal conditions, each portfolio manager s portfolio segment typically includes a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 15 securities. A portfolio manager may occasionally hold more than 15 securities, including, without limitation, during the transition period following the termination of a portfolio manager. 1011 Each of the Value Fund s portfolio managers has its own unique approach to company analysis and may define value differently. Each has the freedom to invest to a limited extent in foreign stocks and the stocks of smaller. However, the portfolio managers primarily focus on mid- and large-sized U.S.-based and are less likely to own foreign domiciled or stocks of small. The Value Fund is structured as a non-diversified fund. Diversification is a way to reduce risk by investing in a wide range of securities. Although the Value Fund is structured as a nondiversified fund, it is likely that most of the time the portfolio will be diversified. In instances when the Value Fund s portfolio is not diversified, it may own large positions in a small number of securities. Because the change in value of any one security owned by the Value Fund may have a significant effect on the daily NAV of the Value Fund, the share price may be expected to fluctuate more than that of a diversified fund. Significant fluctuations may affect the performance of the Value Fund. The following table provides a description of the Value Fund s sub-advisor and two portfolio managers and their target levels of assets. Asset levels will fluctuate and it is at the discretion of Litman Gregory to re-balance the manager allocations. A detailed discussion of the management structure of the Value Fund follows the table. PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S)/SUB- ADVISOR TARGET MANAGER ALLOCATION MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF COMPANIES IN PORTFOLIO STOCK-PICKING STYLE Clyde McGregor Harris Associates L.P. Up to 100% Mostly large- and midsized Value Bill Nygren Harris Associates L.P. Up to 100% Mostly large- and midsized Value The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of the description of Clyde S. McGregor of Harris Associates L.P. in the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Value Fund Managers on page 45 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Up to 100% of the Value Fund s assets are managed by McGregor, who employs Harris value investment philosophy and process. This investment philosophy is based upon the belief that, over time, a company s stock price converges with the company s intrinsic or true business value. By true business value, Harris means an estimate of the price a knowledgeable buyer would pay to acquire the entire business. In making its investment decisions, Harris uses a bottom-up approach focused on individual, rather than focusing on specific economic factors or specific industries. 1112 The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of the description of William C. Nygren of Harris Associates L.P. in the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Value Fund Managers on page 45 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Up to 100% of the Value Fund s assets are managed by Nygren, who employs Harris value investment philosophy and process. This investment philosophy is based upon the belief that, over time, a company s stock price converges with the company s intrinsic or true business value. By true business value, Harris means an estimate of the price a knowledgeable buyer would pay to acquire the entire business. In making its investment decisions, Harris uses a bottom-up approach focused on individual, rather than focusing on specific economic factors or specific industries. The following information replaces the three paragraphs and the table beginning on page 47 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Litman Gregory Masters Smaller Companies Fund Sub-Advisors Litman Gregory s strategy is to allocate the portfolio s assets among the Smaller Companies Fund s four sub-advisors who, based on Litman Gregory s research, are judged to be among the best in their respective style groups. The sub-advisors manage their individual portfolio segments by building a focused portfolio representing their highest-confidence stocks. Under normal market conditions, the Smaller Companies Fund invests at least 80% of the Smaller Companies Fund s net assets in securities of small and mid-sized U.S.. This investment policy may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval, but shareholders would be given at least 60 days notice if any change occurs. Under normal conditions, each manager s portfolio segment typically includes a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 15 securities. A manager may occasionally hold more than 15 securities. Though the total number of securities the Smaller Companies Fund may hold at any point in time will vary, it is generally expected that the Smaller Companies Fund will hold between 50 and 75 securities. As used in this Prospectus, Litman Gregory defines a Smaller Company as one whose market capitalization falls within the range of market capitalizations of any company in the Russell 2500 Index, as of the most recent reconstitution. Though the primary capitalization focus of the Smaller Companies Fund is in the small-cap sector, Litman Gregory does not believe that small-cap investors should be forced to sell a stock that appreciates beyond the upper thresholds of the small-cap range if the stock picker continues to maintain a high level of conviction with respect to the holding. This has been a problem with many small-cap funds, as they have, at times, been forced to sell some of their most compelling holdings. Moreover, occasionally in the mid-cap range will be extraordinarily attractive to the Smaller Companies Fund s investment managers. Overall, Litman Gregory expects the majority of the Smaller Companies Fund s holdings at any point in time to meet the definition of a Small Company, but the Smaller Companies Fund has the flexibility to hold mid-sized if the managers believe that holding these will lead to higher overall returns. The managers have the flexibility to invest up to 50% (measured at the time of original investment) of their respective portfolios in mid-cap if these stocks qualify as their highest conviction holdings. 1213 The following table provides a description of the Smaller Companies Fund s four sub-advisors and their target levels of assets. Asset levels will fluctuate and it is at the discretion of Litman Gregory to re-balance the manager allocations. A detailed discussion of the management structure of the Smaller Companies Fund follows the table. PORTFOLIO MANAGER(S)/SUB- ADVISOR TARGET MANAGER ALLOCATION MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF COMPANIES IN PORTFOLIO STOCK-PICKING STYLE Jeff Bronchick Cove Street Capital, LLC 25% Small- and midsized Value Dennis Bryan Rikard Ekstrand First Pacific Advisors, LLC 25% Small- and midsized Value Frank Sustersic Turner Investments, L.P. 25% Small- and midsized Growth Richard Weiss Wells Capital Management, Inc. 25% Small- and midsized Blend The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of the description of Cove Street Capital, LLC in the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Smaller Companies Fund Managers on page 48 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Bronchick is responsible for managing approximately 25% of the Smaller Companies Fund s assets. The objective of Bronchick s fundamental research is to identify the best combination of attractive businesses, valuation, and shareholder-oriented management. His small-cap universe consists of between $100 million and $3 billion. 1314 The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of the description of First Pacific Advisors, LLC in the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Smaller Companies Fund Managers on page 49 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: The team is responsible for managing approximately 25% of the Smaller Companies Fund s assets. The general objective of the team s stock research is to identify stocks from a variety of sources that are cheap relative to their peer group and are characterized by strong balance sheets, solid or improving fundamentals and strong competitive positions in their industry. In addition, they focus on that exhibit strong free cash flow, quality management and understandable business strategies. The team also emphasizes above-average return-on-capital though the team tends not to focus on rapidly growing that generate very high returns on assets because these rarely meet the team s valuation criteria. The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of the description of Turner Investments, L.P. in the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Smaller Companies Fund Managers on page 50 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Approximately 25% of the Smaller Companies Fund s assets are managed by Sustersic. He invests primarily in domestic that he believes have the potential for strong earnings growth, with a focus on between $200 million and $3 billion in market capitalization. Sustersic specifically looks for with strong operating business models that will lead to accelerating earnings and improving earnings expectations. Typically these are with a specific edge, such as a compelling or unique product or service. Investment ideas are generated from a number of sources, and include quantitative screens, daily investment-team meetings/sector commentaries, fundamental analysis and/or trade checks of existing or potential holdings, as well as Sustersic s general knowledge of the micro/small-cap universe. The following paragraph replaces the second paragraph of the description of Wells Capital Management, Inc. in the section titled Litman Gregory Masters Smaller Companies Fund Managers on page 50 of the Prospectus dated May 1, 2013: Approximately 25% of the Smaller Companies Fund s assets are managed by Weiss. He invests in stocks of small- and mid-sized that are undervalued either because they are not broadly recognized, are in transition, or are out of favor based on short-term factors. Weiss also has the flexibility to invest in the stocks of larger if in his opinion they offer the potential for better returns. In seeking attractively valued, Weiss focuses on with above-average growth potential that also exhibit some or all of the following: Low institutional investor ownership and low analyst coverage High-quality management Sustainable competitive advantage Please keep this Supplement with your Prospectus. 1415 16

The 2014 Financial Times Top 300 Registered Investment Advisors is an independent listing produced by the Financial Times (June, 2014). The FT 300 is based on data gathered from RIA firms, regulatory disclosures, and the FT’s research. As identified by the FT, the listing reflected each practice’s performance in six primary areas, including assets under management, asset growth, compliance record, years in existence, credentials and accessibility. Neither the RIA firms nor their employees pay a fee to The Financial Times in exchange for inclusion in the FT 300. 630 RIAs submitted applications; 48% received this recognition. The award may not be representative of any one client’s experience and the award is not indicative of the advisor’s future performance. 







1. Chris Wheaton was named on 2009 Barron’s list of the Top 100 Independent Financial Advisers in the nation.  In 2009 Mr. Wheaton was 90 of 100 advisors.  The ranking reflects the volume of assets overseen by the advisors and their teams, revenues generated for the firms and the quality of the advisors’ practices.  Less weight is given to assets and revenues from institutional clients.  The scoring system assigns a top score of 100 and rates the rest by comparing them with the winner.   Such rating is not representative of the experience of any single client of Litman Gregory Asset Management, LLC and is not indicative of the future performance of Mr. Wheaton or the firm.
2. Chris Wheaton was named among The Top 250 Wealth Advisors in the U.S. by Worth Magazine in 2008. This was the ninth consecutive year that Mr. Wheaton has been named to the advisor list. The editors use a number of selection criteria including education, experience, client retention, and investment performance. Such rating is not representative of the experience of any single client of Litman Gregory Asset Management, LLC and is not indicative of the future performance of Mr. Wheaton or the firm.





Litman Gregory Asset Management is the recipient of the 2008 Schwab IMPACT® Best-in Business Award.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

3 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 3 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 595 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks long-term growth of capital; that is, the increase in the value of the investment over the long term.




Strategy



The fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in the securities of companies organized or located outside of the United States, including large-, mid-, and small-cap companies and companies located in emerging markets. Each sub-advisor uses its own discretion to invest in any sized company it deems appropriate.


Risk



Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. Value and growth stocks can perform differently from other types of stocks. Growth stocks can be more volatile. Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments.

Litman Gregory Asset Management LLC


                  Litman Gregory Asset Management (LGAM) is a value manager that seeks to invest in a globally diverse set of asset classes that are selling at considerable discounts to their fair value. The firm's long-term approach allows them to capitalize on temporarily mispriced investments and typically ensures that fundamentals dictate asset prices. LGAM relies on forward-looking analysis to evaluate how the world is evolving and to incorporate their opinions about these changes into the firm's assessment of risk and investment allocations. The firm also offers access to investments in mutual funds and private investment vehicles.LGAM's investment strategies begin with a neutral asset allocation that reflects what they believe is a sensible static asset allocation for a hypothetical long-term investor who is not actively allocating assets. Asset classes in the neutral allocation for their basic portfolio strategies include: investment grade bonds, large-cap US stocks, small-cap US stocks and foreign stocks. They shift portfolio allocations away from the neutral allocation only when fear or greed has driven prices of a certain asset class to unjustified extremes. At the margin, LGAM's asset allocation decisions may also be influenced by long-term trends that the firm believes will have a significant impact on the future investment climate. The firm also uses scenario analysis to manage portfolio allocation's risk exposure. This involves testing the impact on the portfolio of various economic and market scenarios. If LGAM identifies an opportunity to manage risk better, this analysis may result in adjustments to a portfolio's asset allocation. LGAM maintains at least a 3 year time horizon. The firm analyzes and chooses actively managed mutual funds or private investments, and in some instances, index funds, to implement their asset allocation.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.

Amana Mutual Funds Trust
 





Amana Founders Video

 


Watch Amana Mutual Funds Trust founders, Nick Kaiser and Yaqub Mirza, discuss the creation and history of the Trust.

At Saturna Capital and the Amana Mutual Funds Trust, we endeavor to align our investments with our principles.
Our Funds favor companies with low price-to-earnings multiples, strong balance sheets, and proven businesses. They follow a value-oriented approach consistent with Islamic finance principles. Generally, these principles require that investors avoid interest and investments in businesses such as liquor, pornography, gambling, and banks. The Funds avoid bonds and other conventional fixed-income securities.
Saturna Capital selects investments in companies that to its knowledge do not violate the requirements of the Islamic faith at the time of investment. To ensure that investments continue to meet the requirements of the Islamic faith, Saturna Capital engages Amanie Advisors Sdn Bhd, a leading consultant specializing in Islamic finance.
The Amana Funds limit the securities they purchase to those consistent with Islamic principles. This limits opportunities and may affect performance.
