Nokia 4xxx
The Nokia 4000 series was officially skipped as a sign of deference from Nokia towards East Asian customers.[3]
Nokia 5xxx – Active series (1998–2010)[edit]
The Nokia 5000 series is similar in features to the 3000 series, but often contains more features geared toward active individuals. Many of the 5000 series phones feature a rugged construction or contain extra features for music playback.

The 7110 was the first Nokia phone with a WAP browser. WAP was significantly hyped up during the 1998–2000 Internet boom. However WAP did not meet these expectations and uptake was limited. Another industry first was the flap, which slid from beneath the phone with a push from the release button. Unfortunately the cover was not too durable. The 7110 was also the only phone to feature a navi-roller key.
The 7250i was a slightly improved version of the Nokia 7250. It includes XHTML and OMA Forward lock digital rights management. The phone has exactly the same design as the 7250. This phone is far more popular than the 7250 and has been made available on pre-paid packages and therefore it is very popular amongst youths in the UK and other European countries.
The 7510 Supernova was a phone exclusive to T-Mobile USA. Only some units of this model have Wi-Fi chips with UMA. The Wi-Fi adapter on this phone supports up to WPA2 encryption if present. This phone uses Xpress-On Covers.
The 7650 was the first Series 60 smartphone of Nokia. It was quite basic compared to smartphones, it didn't have MMC slot, but it had a camera.
The 7610 was Nokia's first smartphone featuring a megapixel camera (1,152x864 pixels), and is targeted towards the fashion conscious individual. End-users can also use the 7610 with Nokia Lifeblog. Other pre-installed applications include the Opera and Kodak Photo Sharing. It is notable for its looks, having opposite corners rounded off. It comes with a 64 MB Reduced Size MMC. The main CPU is an ARM compatible chip (ARM4T architecture) running at 123 MHz.
The 7710's 640x320 screen was a touch screen phone.
Nokia 8xxx – Premium series (1996–2007)[edit]
This series is characterized by ergonomics and attractiveness. The internals of the phone are similar to those in different series and so on that level offer nothing particularly different, however the physical handset itself offers a level of functionality which appeals to users who focus on ergonomics. The front slide keypad covers offered a pseudo-flip that at the time Nokia were unwilling to make. Materials used increased the cost and hence exclusivity of these handsets.
The only exception to the rule (there are many in different series) is the 82xx, 8310 which were very small and light handsets.

Note:

Although part of the Nseries, the Nokia N800 and N810 Internet Tablets did not include phone functionality. See the Internet Tablets section.
The N950 was meant to be the N9-00 with the old N9 'Lankku' being N9-01, however the N9-00 model number was used for the all touch 'Lankku' with the original design being the MeeGo developer-only N950.

Personal computers[edit]
In the 1980s, Nokia's personal computer division Nokia Data manufactured a series of personal computers by the name of MikroMikko.
Nokia's PC division was sold to the British computer company ICL in 1991. In 1990, Fujitsu had acquired 80% of ICL plc, which throughout the decade became wholly the part of Fujitsu.[10] Personal computers and servers were marketed under the ICL brand; the Nokia MikroMikko line of compact desktop computers continued to be produced at the Kilo factories in Espoo, Finland. Components, including motherboards and Ethernet network adapters were manufactured locally, until P was moved to Taiwan. Internationally the MikroMikko line was marketed by Fujitsu as the ErgoPro.
In 1999, Fujitsu Siemens Computers was formed as a joint venture between Fujitsu Computers Europe and Siemens Computer Systems, wherein all of ICL's hardware business (except VME mainframes) was absorbed into the joint venture. On 1 April 2009, Fujitsu bought out Siemens' share of the joint venture, and Fujitsu Siemens Computers became Fujitsu Technology Solutions. Fujitsu continues to manufacture computers in Europe,[11] including PC mainboards developed and manufactured in-house.
Mini laptops[edit]
Main article: Nokia Booklet 3G
On 24 August 2009, Nokia announced that they will be re-entering the PC business with a high-end mini laptop called the Nokia Booklet 3G.[12] It was D few years later.

Nokia produced CRT and early TFT LCD Multigraph displays for PC and larger systems application. The Nokia Display Products' branded business was sold to ViewSonic in 2000.[13]

Nokia 4xxx
The Nokia 4000 series was officially skipped as a sign of deference from Nokia towards East Asian customers.[3]
Nokia 5xxx – Active series (1998–2010)[edit]
The Nokia 5000 series is similar in features to the 3000 series, but often contains more features geared toward active individuals. Many of the 5000 series phones feature a rugged construction or contain extra features for music playback.

The 7110 was the first Nokia phone with a WAP browser. WAP was significantly hyped up during the 1998–2000 Internet boom. However WAP did not meet these expectations and uptake was limited. Another industry first was the flap, which slid from beneath the phone with a push from the release button. Unfortunately the cover was not too durable. The 7110 was also the only phone to feature a navi-roller key.
The 7250i was a slightly improved version of the Nokia 7250. It includes XHTML and OMA Forward lock digital rights management. The phone has exactly the same design as the 7250. This phone is far more popular than the 7250 and has been made available on pre-paid packages and therefore it is very popular amongst youths in the UK and other European countries.
The 7510 Supernova was a phone exclusive to T-Mobile USA. Only some units of this model have Wi-Fi chips with UMA. The Wi-Fi adapter on this phone supports up to WPA2 encryption if present. This phone uses Xpress-On Covers.
The 7650 was the first Series 60 smartphone of Nokia. It was quite basic compared to smartphones, it didn't have MMC slot, but it had a camera.
The 7610 was Nokia's first smartphone featuring a megapixel camera (1,152x864 pixels), and is targeted towards the fashion conscious individual. End-users can also use the 7610 with Nokia Lifeblog. Other pre-installed applications include the Opera and Kodak Photo Sharing. It is notable for its looks, having opposite corners rounded off. It comes with a 64 MB Reduced Size MMC. The main CPU is an ARM compatible chip (ARM4T architecture) running at 123 MHz.
The 7710's 640x320 screen was a touch screen phone.
Nokia 8xxx – Premium series (1996–2007)[edit]
This series is characterized by ergonomics and attractiveness. The internals of the phone are similar to those in different series and so on that level offer nothing particularly different, however the physical handset itself offers a level of functionality which appeals to users who focus on ergonomics. The front slide keypad covers offered a pseudo-flip that at the time Nokia were unwilling to make. Materials used increased the cost and hence exclusivity of these handsets.
The only exception to the rule (there are many in different series) is the 82xx, 8310 which were very small and light handsets.

Although part of the Nseries, the Nokia N800 and N810 Internet Tablets did not include phone functionality. See the Internet Tablets section.
The N950 was meant to be the N9-00 with the old N9 'Lankku' being N9-01, however the N9-00 model number was used for the all touch 'Lankku' with the original design being the MeeGo developer-only N950.

Personal computers[edit]
In the 1980s, Nokia's personal computer division Nokia Data manufactured a series of personal computers by the name of MikroMikko.
Nokia's PC division was sold to the British computer company ICL in 1991. In 1990, Fujitsu had acquired 80% of ICL plc, which throughout the decade became wholly the part of Fujitsu.[10] Personal computers and servers were marketed under the ICL brand; the Nokia MikroMikko line of compact desktop computers continued to be produced at the Kilo factories in Espoo, Finland. Components, including motherboards and Ethernet network adapters were manufactured locally, until P was moved to Taiwan. Internationally the MikroMikko line was marketed by Fujitsu as the ErgoPro.
In 1999, Fujitsu Siemens Computers was formed as a joint venture between Fujitsu Computers Europe and Siemens Computer Systems, wherein all of ICL's hardware business (except VME mainframes) was absorbed into the joint venture. On 1 April 2009, Fujitsu bought out Siemens' share of the joint venture, and Fujitsu Siemens Computers became Fujitsu Technology Solutions. Fujitsu continues to manufacture computers in Europe,[11] including PC mainboards developed and manufactured in-house.
Mini laptops[edit]
Main article: Nokia Booklet 3G
On 24 August 2009, Nokia announced that they will be re-entering the PC business with a high-end mini laptop called the Nokia Booklet 3G.[12] It was D few years later.

Nokia 3xxx – Expression series (1997–2009, 2017)[edit]

Nokia 4xxx
The Nokia 4000 series was officially skipped as a sign of deference from Nokia towards East Asian customers.[3]
Nokia 5xxx – Active series (1998–2010)[edit]
The Nokia 5000 series is similar in features to the 3000 series, but often contains more features geared toward active individuals. Many of the 5000 series phones feature a rugged construction or contain extra features for music playback.

The 7110 was the first Nokia phone with a WAP browser. WAP was significantly hyped up during the 1998–2000 Internet boom. However WAP did not meet these expectations and uptake was limited. Another industry first was the flap, which slid from beneath the phone with a push from the release button. Unfortunately the cover was not too durable. The 7110 was also the only phone to feature a navi-roller key.
The 7250i was a slightly improved version of the Nokia 7250. It includes XHTML and OMA Forward lock digital rights management. The phone has exactly the same design as the 7250. This phone is far more popular than the 7250 and has been made available on pre-paid packages and therefore it is very popular amongst youths in the UK and other European countries.
The 7510 Supernova was a phone exclusive to T-Mobile USA. Only some units of this model have Wi-Fi chips with UMA. The Wi-Fi adapter on this phone supports up to WPA2 encryption if present. This phone uses Xpress-On Covers.
The 7650 was the first Series 60 smartphone of Nokia. It was quite basic compared to smartphones, it didn't have MMC slot, but it had a camera.
The 7610 was Nokia's first smartphone featuring a megapixel camera (1,152x864 pixels), and is targeted towards the fashion conscious individual. End-users can also use the 7610 with Nokia Lifeblog. Other pre-installed applications include the Opera and Kodak Photo Sharing. It is notable for its looks, having opposite corners rounded off. It comes with a 64 MB Reduced Size MMC. The main CPU is an ARM compatible chip (ARM4T architecture) running at 123 MHz.
The 7710's 640x320 screen was a touch screen phone.
Nokia 8xxx – Premium series (1996–2007)[edit]
This series is characterized by ergonomics and attractiveness. The internals of the phone are similar to those in different series and so on that level offer nothing particularly different, however the physical handset itself offers a level of functionality which appeals to users who focus on ergonomics. The front slide keypad covers offered a pseudo-flip that at the time Nokia were unwilling to make. Materials used increased the cost and hence exclusivity of these handsets.
The only exception to the rule (there are many in different series) is the 82xx, 8310 which were very small and light handsets.

Although part of the Nseries, the Nokia N800 and N810 Internet Tablets did not include phone functionality. See the Internet Tablets section.
The N950 was meant to be the N9-00 with the old N9 'Lankku' being N9-01, however the N9-00 model number was used for the all touch 'Lankku' with the original design being the MeeGo developer-only N950.

Personal computers[edit]
In the 1980s, Nokia's personal computer division Nokia Data manufactured a series of personal computers by the name of MikroMikko.
Nokia's PC division was sold to the British computer company ICL in 1991. In 1990, Fujitsu had acquired 80% of ICL plc, which throughout the decade became wholly the part of Fujitsu.[10] Personal computers and servers were marketed under the ICL brand; the Nokia MikroMikko line of compact desktop computers continued to be produced at the Kilo factories in Espoo, Finland. Components, including motherboards and Ethernet network adapters were manufactured locally, until P was moved to Taiwan. Internationally the MikroMikko line was marketed by Fujitsu as the ErgoPro.
In 1999, Fujitsu Siemens Computers was formed as a joint venture between Fujitsu Computers Europe and Siemens Computer Systems, wherein all of ICL's hardware business (except VME mainframes) was absorbed into the joint venture. On 1 April 2009, Fujitsu bought out Siemens' share of the joint venture, and Fujitsu Siemens Computers became Fujitsu Technology Solutions. Fujitsu continues to manufacture computers in Europe,[11] including PC mainboards developed and manufactured in-house.
Mini laptops[edit]

Nokia Corporation - Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Nokia Corporation






Keilalahdentie 4FIN-02150EspooFinland
Company Perspectives
By connecting people, we help fulfill a fundamental human need for social connections and contact. Nokia builds bridges between people--both when they are far apart and face-to-face--and also bridges the gap between people and the information they need.
History of Nokia Corporation






Nokia Corporation is the world's largest manufacturer of mobile phones, serving customers in 130 countries. Nokia is divided into four business groups: Mobile Phones, Multimedia, Enterprise Solutions, and Networks. The Mobile Phones group markets wireless voice and data products in consumer and corporate markets. The Multimedia segment sells mobile gaming devices, home satellite systems, and cable television set-top boxes. The Enterprise Solutions group develops wireless systems for use in the corporate sector. Wireless switching and transmission equipment is sold through the company's Networks division. Nokia operates 15 manufacturing facilities in nine countries and maintains research and development facilities in 12 countries.
19th-Century Origins
Originally a manufacturer of pulp and paper, Nokia was founded as Nokia Company in 1865 in a small town of the same name in central Finland. Nokia was a pioneer in the industry and introduced many new production methods to a country with only one major natural resource, its vast forests. As the industry became increasingly energy-intensive, the company even constructed its own power plants. But for many years, Nokia remained an important yet static firm in a relatively forgotten corner of northern Europe. Nokia shares were first listed on the Helsinki exchange in 1915.
The first major changes in Nokia occurred several years after World War II. Despite its proximity to the Soviet Union, Finland has always remained economically connected with Scandinavian and other Western countries, and as Finnish trade expanded Nokia became a leading exporter.
During the early 1960s Nokia began to diversify in an attempt to transform the company into a regional conglomerate with interests beyond Finnish borders. Unable to initiate strong internal growth, Nokia turned its attention to acquisitions. The government, however, hoping to rationalize two underperforming basic industries, favored Nokia's expansion within the country and encouraged its eventual merger with Finnish Rubber Works, which was founded in 1898, and Finnish Cable Works, which was formed in 1912, to form Nokia Corporation. When the amalgamation was completed in 1966, Nokia was involved in several new industries, including integrated cable operations, electronics, tires, and rubber footwear, and had made its first public share offering.
In 1967 Nokia set up a division to develop design and manufacturing capabilities in data processing, industrial automation, and communications systems. The division was later expanded and made into several divisions, which then concentrated on developing information systems, including personal computers and workstations, digital communications systems, and mobile phones. Nokia also gained a strong position in modems and automatic banking systems in Scandinavia.
Oil Crisis, Corporate Changes: 1970s
Nokia continued to operate in a stable but parochial manner until 1973, when it was affected in a unique way by the oil crisis. Years of political accommodation between Finland and the Soviet Union ensured Finnish neutrality in exchange for lucrative trade agreements with the Soviets, mainly Finnish lumber products and machinery in exchange for Soviet oil. By agreement, this trade was kept strictly in balance. But when world oil prices began to rise, the market price for Soviet oil rose with it. Balanced trade began to mean greatly reduced purchasing power for Finnish companies such as Nokia.
Although the effects were not catastrophic, the oil crisis did force Nokia to reassess its reliance on Soviet trade (about 12 percent of sales) as well as its international growth strategies. Several contingency plans were drawn up, but the greatest changes came after the company appointed a new CEO, Kari Kairamo, in 1975.
Kairamo noted the obvious: Nokia was too big for Finland. The company had to expand abroad. He studied the expansion of other Scandinavian companies (particularly Sweden's Electrolux) and, following their example, formulated a strategy of first consolidating the company's business in Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, and then moving gradually into the rest of Europe. After the company had improved its product line, established a reputation for quality, and adjusted its production capacity, it would enter the world market.
Meanwhile, Nokia's traditional, heavy industries were looking increasingly burdensome. It was feared that trying to become a leader in electronics while maintaining these basic industries would create an unmanageably unfocused company. Kairamo thought briefly about selling off the company's weaker divisions, but decided to retain and modernize them.
He reasoned that, although the modernization of these low-growth industries would be very expensive, it would guarantee Nokia's position in several stable markets, including paper, chemical, and machinery productions, and electrical generation. For the scheme to be practical, each division's modernization would have to be gradual and individually financed. This would prevent the bleeding of funds away from the all-important effort in electronics while preventing the heavy industries from becoming any less profitable.
With each division financing its own modernization, there was little or no drain on capital from other divisions, and Nokia could still sell any group that did not succeed under the new plan. In the end, the plan prompted the machinery division to begin development in robotics and automation, the cables division to begin work on fiber optics, and the forestry division to move into high-grade tissues.
Rise of Electronics: 1980s
Nokia's most important focus was development of the electronics sector. Over the course of the 1980s, the firm acquired nearly 20 companies, focusing especially on three segments of the electronics industry: consumer, workstations, and mobile communications. Electronics grew from 10 percent of annual sales to 60 percent of revenues from 1980 to 1988.
In late 1984 Nokia acquired Salora, the largest color television manufacturer in Scandinavia, and Luxor, the Swedish state-owned electronics and computer firm. Nokia combined Salora and Luxor into a single division and concentrated on stylish consumer electronic products, since style was a crucial factor in Scandinavian markets. The Salora-Luxor division was also very successful in satellite and digital television technology. Nokia purchased the consumer electronics operations of Standard Elektrik Lorenz A.G. from Alcatel in 1987, further bolstering the company's position in the television market to the third largest manufacturer in Europe.
In early 1988 Nokia acquired the data systems division of the Swedish Ericsson Group, making Nokia the largest Scandinavian information technology business.
Although a market leader in Scandinavia, Nokia still lacked a degree of competitiveness in the European market, which was dominated by much larger Japanese and German companies. Kairamo decided, therefore, to follow the example of many Japanese companies during the 1960s (and Korean manufacturers a decade later) and negotiate to become an original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, to manufacture products for competitors as a subcontractor.





Nokia manufactured items for Hitachi in France, Ericsson in Sweden, Northern Telecom in Canada, and Granada and IBM in Britain. In doing so it was able to increase its production capacity stability. There were, however, several risks involved, those inherent in any OEM arrangement. Nokia's sales margins were naturally reduced, but of greater concern, production capacity was built up without a commensurate expansion in the sales network. With little brand identification, Nokia feared it might have a difficult time selling under its own name and become trapped as an OEM.
In 1986 Nokia reorganized its management structure to simplify reporting efforts and improve control by central management. The company's 11 divisions were grouped into four industry segments: electronics; cables and machinery; paper, power, and chemicals; and rubber and flooring. In addition, Nokia won a concession from the Finnish government to allow greater foreign participation in ownership. This substantially reduced Nokia's dependence on the comparatively expensive Finnish lending market. Although there was growth throughout the company, Nokia's greatest success was in telecommunications.
Having dabbled in telecommunications in the 1960s, Nokia cut its teeth in the industry by selling switching systems under license from a French company, Alcatel. The Finnish firm got in on the cellular industry's ground floor in the late 1970s, when it helped design the world's first international cellular system. Named the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) network, the system linked Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. A year after the network came on line in 1981, Nokia gained 100 percent control of Mobira, the Finnish mobile phone company that would later become its key business interest as the Nokia Mobile Phones division. Mobira's regional sales were vastly improved, but Nokia was still limited to OEM production on the international market; Nokia and Tandy Corporation, of the United States, built a factory in Masan, South Korea, to manufacture mobile telephones. These were sold under the Tandy name in that company's 6,000 Radio Shack stores throughout the United States.
In 1986, eager to test its ability to compete openly, Nokia chose the mobile telephone to be the first product marketed internationally under the Nokia name; it became Nokia's "make or break" product. Unfortunately, Asian competitors began to drive prices down just as Nokia entered the market. Other Nokia products gaining recognition were Salora televisions and Luxor satellite dishes, which suffered briefly when subscription programming introduced broadcast scrambling.
The company's expansion, achieved almost exclusively by acquisition, had been expensive. Few Finnish investors other than institutions had the patience to see Nokia through its long-term plans. Indeed, more than half of the new shares issued by Nokia in 1987 went to foreign investors. Nokia moved boldly into Western markets; it gained a listing on the London exchange in 1987 and was subsequently listed on the New York exchange.
Crises of Leadership, Profitability in the Late 1980s and Early 1990s
Nokia's rapid growth was not without a price. In 1988, as revenues soared, the company's profits, under pressure from severe price competition in the consumer electronics markets, dropped. Chairman Kari Kairamo committed suicide in December of that year; not surprisingly, friends said it was brought on by stress. Simo S. Vuorileto took over the company's reins and began streamlining operations in the spring of 1988. Nokia was divided into six business groups: consumer electronics, data, mobile phones, telecommunications, cables and machinery, and basic industries. Vuorileto continued Kairamo's focus on high-tech divisions, divesting Nokia's flooring, paper, rubber, and ventilation systems businesses and entering into joint ventures with companies such as Tandy Corporation and Matra of France (two separate agreements to produce mobile phones for the U.S. and French markets).
In spite of these efforts, Nokia's pretax profits continued to decline in 1989 and 1990, culminating in a loss of $102 million in 1991. Industry observers blamed cutthroat European competition, the breakdown of the Finnish banking system, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. But, notwithstanding these difficulties, Nokia remained committed to its high-tech orientation. Late in 1991, the company strengthened that dedication by promoting Jorma Ollila from president of Nokia-Mobira Inc. (renamed Nokia Mobile Phones Ltd. the following year) to group president.
Leading the Telecommunications Revolution: Mid-1990s and Beyond
Forbes's Fleming Meeks credited Ollila with transforming Nokia from "a moneylosing hodgepodge of companies into one of telecommunications' most profitable companies." Unable to find a buyer for Nokia's consumer electronics business, which had lost nearly $1 billion from 1988 to 1993, Ollila cut that segment's workforce by 45 percent, shuttered plants, and centralized operations. Having divested Nokia Data in 1991, Nokia focused further on its telecommunications core by selling off its power unit in 1994 and its television and tire and cable units the following year.
The new leader achieved success in the cellular phone segment by bringing innovative products to market quickly with a particular focus on ever smaller and easier-to-use phones featuring sleek Finnish design. Nokia gained a leg up in cellphone research and development with the 1991 acquisition of the United Kingdom's Technophone Ltd. for $57 million. The company began selling digital cellular phones in 1993.
Ollila's tenure brought Nokia success and with it global recognition. The company's sales more than doubled, from FIM 15.5 billion in 1991 to FIM 36.8 billion in 1995, and its bottom line rebounded from a net loss of FIM 723 million in 1992 to a FIM 2.2 billion profit in 1995. Securities investors did not miss the turnaround: Nokia's market capitalization multiplied ten times from 1991 to 1994.
In late 1995 and early 1996, Nokia suffered a temporary setback stemming from a shortage of chips for its digital cellular phones and a resultant disruption of its logistics chain. The company's production costs rose and profits fell. Nokia was also slightly ahead of the market, particularly in North America, in regard to the shift from analog to digital phones. As a result, it was saddled with a great number of digital phones it could not sell and an insufficient number of analog devices. Nevertheless, Nokia had positioned itself well for the long haul, and within just a year or two it was arch-rival Motorola, Inc. that was burdened with an abundance of phones it could not sell, analog ones, as Motorola was slow to convert to digital. As a result, by late 1998, Nokia had surpassed Motorola and claimed the top position in cellular phones worldwide.
Aiding this surge was the November 1997 introduction of the 6100 series of digital phones. This line proved immensely popular because of the phones' small size (similar to a slim pack of cigarettes), light weight (4.5 ounces), and superior battery life. First introduced in the burgeoning mobile phone market in China, the 6100 soon became a worldwide phenomenon. Including the 6100 and other models, Nokia sold nearly 41 million cellular phones in 1998. Net sales increased more than 50 percent over the previous year, jumping from FIM 52.61 billion ($9.83 billion) to FIM 79.23 billion ($15.69 billion). Operating profits increased by 75 percent, while the company's skyrocketing stock price shot up more than 220 percent, pushing Nokia's market capitalization from FIM 110.01 billion ($20.57 billion) to FIM 355.53 billion ($70.39 billion).
Not content with conquering the mobile phone market, Nokia began aggressively pursuing the mobile Internet sector in the late 1990s. Already on the market was the Nokia 9000 Communicator, a personal all-in-one communication device that included phone, data, Internet, e-mail, and fax retrieval services. The Nokia 8110 mobile phone included the capability to access the Internet. In addition, Nokia was the first company to introduce a cellular phone that could be connected to a laptop computer to transmit data over a mobile network. To help develop further products, Nokia began acquiring Internet technology companies, starting with the December 1997, $120 million purchase of Ipsilon Networks Inc., a Silicon Valley firm specializing in Internet routing. One year later, Nokia spent FIM 429 million ($85 million) for Vienna Systems Corporation, a Canadian firm focusing on Internet Protocol telephony.
Acquisitions continued in 1999, when a further seven deals were completed, four of which were Internet-related. Meanwhile, net sales increased a further 48 percent in 1999, while operating profits grew by 57 percent; riding the late 1990s high-tech stock boom, the market capitalization of Nokia took another huge leap, ending the year at EUR 209.37 billion ($211.05 billion). Nokia's share of the global cellular phone market increased from 22.5 percent in 1998 to 26.9 percent in 1999, as the company sold 76.3 million phones in 1999.
Nokia's ascendance to the top of the wireless world by the end of the 1990s could be traced to the company being able to consistently, over and over again, come out with high-margin products superior to those of its competitors and in tune with market demands. The continuation of this trend into the 21st century was by no means certain as the increasing convergence of wireless and Internet technologies and the development of the third generation (3G) of wireless technology (which followed the analog and digital generations and which was slated to feature sophisticated multimedia capability) were predicted to open Nokia up to new and formidable competitors.
Perhaps the greatest threat was that chipmakers such as Intel would turn mobile phones into commodities just as they had previously done with personal computers; the days of the $500 Nokia phone were potentially numbered. Nevertheless, Nokia's 25 percent profit margins were enabling it to spend a massive $2 billion a year on research and development and continue to churn out innovative new products, concentrating on the various standards being developed for 3G wireless networks.
A Two-Pronged Approach in the 21st Century
Mobile communications developed along two broad fronts during the first years of the century, both of which played to Nokia's advantage, ensuring that the company remained the leader of its industry. The evolution of handsets into multimedia devices ushered in by 3G technology meant that Nokia could continue to rely on marketing expensive, sophisticated handsets. The days of the $500 Nokia phone gave way to the days of increasingly more expensive phones, such as the Nokia N90, a unit featuring a camera with Carl Zeiss optics, video-recording capabilities, and Internet access. Nokia could count on a substantial share of the high end of the market, a segment that continued to thrive midway through the decade, but the company's greatest strength was in the lower end of the market. In countries such as China, Brazil, and India there was a tremendous demand for inexpensive mobile phones, with analysts expecting 50 percent of the one billion handsets sold between 2005 and 2010 to be sold in developing economies. Industry observers believed there were only two companies in the world that could seriously compete for the estimated 800-million-unit-per year market for inexpensive handsets: Motorola and Nokia. Rivals such as Samsung, Sony Ericsson, and LG Electronics preferred to confine their activities to the high end of the market, while emerging low-cost producers lacked the manufacturing efficiencies enjoyed by Nokia and Motorola.
Against the backdrop of favorable market trends supporting Nokia's entrenched position, the company experienced a rare event in its modern history: a change in leadership. After a decade-and-a-half at the helm, CEO Ollila announced his retirement, effective June 2006. His replacement was a 25-year Nokia veteran named Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, a lawyer by training whom Fortune, in that magazine's October 31, 2005 issue, described as so taciturn that "he can seem like an extra from an Ingmar Bergman movie."
Kallasvuo, who was promoted from his position as the head of the handset division, inherited an impressively capable company whose greatest challenge was contending with Motorola for the low end of the market and beating back competitors for control of the high end of the market. "Nokia is a dynamic company in a fast-changing and fluid environment," Kallasvuo said in a November 29, 2005 interview with the South China Morning Post. "I look forward to working together with our team to help Nokia shape the future of mobile communications at a pivotal time for the industry."

Tweet on Twitter


 Products belonging to Withings, a subsidiary of Nokia Corp (NYSE:NOK), have been pulled from the shelves of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) brick-and-mortar retail stores as well as on the online stores. This comes amidst a patent fight between the California, Cupertino-based tech giant and the Finnish networking technology company.
On the web store, the information that visitors get when searching for Withings products reads as follows: “Looking for something? We thought so. However, the product you’re looking for is no longer available on apple.com.”
Affected products
Among the products belonging to Withings that Apple has pulled from its stores are fitness trackers which have been a feature on the stores for more than two years. Some of the affected products include the Smart Body Analyzer and the Body Cardio Scale.
The row between the two companies started when Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple accusing it of patent infringement. In the suit, Nokia listed 32 patents as having been infringed by Apple. In a counter move, an anti-trust lawsuit was filed by Apple against nine companies that are registered as the holders of the patents with the accusation that they are working in cahoots with Nokia in an extortion attempt against Apple. A countersuit by Apple was also filed against Nokia.
FRAND rules
In its lawsuit, the argument that Apple is using is based on FRAND rules which seek to promote making patents available to any firm at rates that are reasonable since they are important and necessary in developing devices that have become essential in life like smartphones. The FRAND rules are favored by companies that want the patents but not by the companies that hold the patents since they limit the amount of revenue that can be generated from those in possession of the patents.
This is not the first time that the two tech companies are engaged in a patent dispute. Five years ago, after an acrimonious battle, the two firms reached a settlement where Apple was to pay Nokia a one-time payment and royalties for use of Nokia’s smartphone technology. The dispute comes just as Nokia-branded phones running on the Android operating system are about to be launched in early 2017.
In the last trading session on December 23, 2017, Apple edged up 0.20% to close the day at $116.52 a share.

Nokia Corporation[3] (Finnish: Nokia Oyj, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnokiɑ], UK: /ˈnɒkiə/, US: /ˈnoʊkiə/), stylised as NOKIA, is a Finnish multinational communications and information technology company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2014, Nokia employed 61,656 people across 120 countries, did business in more than 150 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €12.73 billion.[2] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world's 274th-largest company measured by 2013 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]
The company has had various industries in its 151-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development, and design licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Nokia's dominance also extended into the smartphone industry through its Symbian platform, but was eventually overshadowed by competitors. Nokia partnered with Microsoft in 2011, agreeing to exclusively use Microsoft's Windows Phone platform on future smartphones; its mobile phone business was eventually bought by Microsoft, in a deal totaling $7.17 billion,[8][9] with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014.[10]
After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).[11][12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through HMD Global.[13]

Main article: History of Nokia
1865–1967[edit]




Rolls of toilet paper produced by Nokia in the 1960s, Museum Centre Vapriikki, Tampere


Nokia has a very long history, dating back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company and called it Nokia, after the site of the second pulp mill. For the next 90 years, Nokia was a forest products and power industry company, with activities such as electricity generation.
In 1922, Nokia entered into a partnership with Finnish Cable Works (Suomen Kaapelitehdas) and Finnish Rubber Works (Suomen Gummitehdas). Finnish Cable Works manufactured telephone and electrical cables, while Finnish Rubber Works made galoshes and other rubber products. The latter company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply. Finnish Cable Works soon did too.
Nokia made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[14]
1967–1990[edit]

In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Finnish Cable Works, and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.
Following Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[15] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
In 1977 Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987 Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) in 1986 before turning to Alcatel.
On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson's Information Systems, which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.
Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.
In 1987, Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

1990–2010[edit]




Jorma Ollila, who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006


Following Simo Vuorilehto's appointment as CEO a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.
Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.
Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900 MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[16]
On 12 June 1996 Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[17] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[18]
Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[19] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[20] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[21]

In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[22] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[23] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[24] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[25] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[26] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[27]
In 1998 Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[28] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[29]
In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[30]

The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone to hit the North American market in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[31] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smartphones for the next six years.[32] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007.[33] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[34] which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008.[35] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[36] They were also well-known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[37]
In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[38] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted "Game Boy is for 10-year-olds",[39] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[40]
Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[41] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[42]
On 1 June 2006 Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, being replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[43]
In August 2007 Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company's new internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[44] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple's App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[45]
In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[46]
2010–2014[edit]

In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[47] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,[48] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history. [49]
The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[50] However in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[51] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android.
Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iPhone OS and Android. To counter this, Nokia started to develop a Linux-based successor, MeeGo, in 2010. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.[52] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[53][54]
On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer," on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[55] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.
When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[56] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[57] the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[58] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[59] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.

In July 2013, Nokia purchased Siemens' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[60] until being rebranded as simply Nokia Networks shortly after.[61] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[62]
2014–present[edit]
After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia started to focus on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[63]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[64]
On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was "valuable" but "is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently."[65] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[66] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would "look and feel just like Nokia built it."[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[67]
According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[68] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products, and seeking of sales partners.[69] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[70]
On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[71] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be "the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions," with more technologic products expected in the future.[72] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[73] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[74] and is listed on its official website as $40,000. [75]




Nokia office building in North America - originally Alcatel-Lucent's office before the acquisition


On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[76] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[77] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[78][79] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[77][80] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[81] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[82] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[83] but wasn't fully completed until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for €2.8 billion.[84] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[85]
On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[86][87]
On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[88][89] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.[90][91] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.
On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[92] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[93]
On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents.[94]
Operations[edit]
Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[95][96] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[97] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland's GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country's exports in 2006.[98]
Nokia comprises of three business groups.
Nokia Networks[edit]
Nokia Networks, formerly known as Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN), is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. It is the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2011 revenues (after Ericsson, Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent).[99] It has operations in around 150 countries.[100]
The NSN brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[101] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. It provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms, and professional services to operators and service providers.[102] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.
In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it Nokia Networks.[103]
Nokia Technologies[edit]
Nokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops and licenses technology and the Nokia brand.[104] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program. It consists of three labs: Radio Systems Lab, in areas of radio access, wireless local connectivity, and radio implementation; Media Technologies Lab, in areas of multimedia and interaction; and Sensor and Material Technologies Lab, in areas of advanced sensing solutions, interaction methods, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies. Nokia Technologies also provides public participation in its development through the Invent with Nokia program.[105]
In November 2014, Nokia Technologies launched its first product, the Nokia N1 Android 5.0 tablet computer manufactured by Foxconn.[106]
In July 2015, Nokia Technologies introduced a VR camera called OZO, designed for professional content creators and developed in Tampere, Finland. With its 8 synchronized shutter sensors and 8 microphones, the product can capture stereoscopic 3D video and spatial audio.[107][108]
Following May 2016, Nokia Technologies' research and development team acts as the base for future Nokia-branded devices created by HMD Global.
On 31 May 2016, the Digital Health unit was founded. It is led by Cédric Hutchings, former CEO of Withings, which Nokia acquired.[109]
On 31 August 2016, Ramzi Haidamus announced he would be stepping down from his position as president of Nokia Technologies.[110] Brad Rodrigues, previously head of strategy and business development, assumed the role of interim president.[111]
Nokia Bell Labs[edit]
Bell Laboratories became a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation after the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent. It was subsequently renamed Nokia Bell Labs.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Corporate governance[edit]
The control and management of Nokia is divided among the shareholders at a general meeting and the Nokia Leadership Team (left),[112] under the direction of the board of directors (right).[113] The chairman and the rest of the Nokia Leadership Team members are appointed by the board of directors. Only the Chairman of the Nokia Leadership Team can belong to both the board of directors and the Nokia Leadership Team. The board of directors' committees consist of the Audit Committee,[114] the Personnel Committee,[115] and the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee.[116][117]

Stock[edit]
Nokia is a public limited liability company and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, beginning in 1915.[121] Nokia has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994.[4][121] Nokia shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003, the Paris Stock Exchange in 2004, the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2007 and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2012.[122] Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the CAC 40 index on 6 January 2016.[123]
In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of €110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to €6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to €26.07 billion.
Corporate culture[edit]
Nokia's official corporate culture manifesto, The Nokia Way, emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a flat, networked organization.[124]
The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.
In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation, and Very Human.[124]
In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business. The new values were defined with the key words respect, achievement, renewal and challenge.
Headquarters[edit]




The Nokia House (now Microsoft Talo) was Nokia's head office up until April 2014. The building is located by the Gulf of Finland in Keilaniemi, Espoo, and was constructed between 1995 and 1997. It was the workplace of more than 1,000 Nokia employees.[121]


The Nokia House was the head office building of Nokia Corporation, located in Keilaniemi, Espoo. The two southernmost parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, northernmost part was built in 2000. Around 5000 employees work in the premises.
In December 2012, Nokia announced that it had sold its head office building to Finland-based Exilion for €170 million and was leasing it back on a long term basis.[125] The building was later sold to Microsoft as part of the sale of the mobile phone business in April 2014 and renamed to Microsoft Talo.[126]
Since the sale, Nokia's headquarters are in Karaportti, Espoo, Finland.[127]

Controversies[edit]
NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran[edit]
In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[133] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes."[134]
During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to the use of the interception technology.[135]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[136]
Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran."[137]
Lex Nokia[edit]
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[138] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[139] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently given the required notice.[140]
Nokia–Apple patent dispute[edit]
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[141] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers."[142] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh, and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[141]
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[143] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[144][145]
Alleged tax evasion in India[edit]
Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[146] The unpaid TDS of ₹30 billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[147]

Nokia Corporation[3] (Finnish: Nokia Oyj, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnokiɑ], UK: /ˈnɒkiə/, US: /ˈnoʊkiə/), stylised as NOKIA, is a Finnish multinational communications and information technology company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2014, Nokia employed 61,656 people across 120 countries, did business in more than 150 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €12.73 billion.[2] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world's 274th-largest company measured by 2013 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]
The company has had various industries in its 151-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development, and design licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Nokia's dominance also extended into the smartphone industry through its Symbian platform, but was eventually overshadowed by competitors. Nokia partnered with Microsoft in 2011, agreeing to exclusively use Microsoft's Windows Phone platform on future smartphones; its mobile phone business was eventually bought by Microsoft, in a deal totaling $7.17 billion,[8][9] with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014.[10]
After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).[11][12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through HMD Global.[13]

Main article: History of Nokia
1865–1967[edit]

Nokia has a very long history, dating back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company and called it Nokia, after the site of the second pulp mill. For the next 90 years, Nokia was a forest products and power industry company, with activities such as electricity generation.
In 1922, Nokia entered into a partnership with Finnish Cable Works (Suomen Kaapelitehdas) and Finnish Rubber Works (Suomen Gummitehdas). Finnish Cable Works manufactured telephone and electrical cables, while Finnish Rubber Works made galoshes and other rubber products. The latter company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply. Finnish Cable Works soon did too.
Nokia made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[14]
1967–1990[edit]

In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Finnish Cable Works, and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.
Following Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[15] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
In 1977 Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987 Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) in 1986 before turning to Alcatel.
On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson's Information Systems, which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.
Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.
In 1987, Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

1990–2010[edit]




Jorma Ollila, who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006


Following Simo Vuorilehto's appointment as CEO a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.
Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.
Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900 MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[16]
On 12 June 1996 Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[17] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[18]
Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[19] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[20] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[21]

In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[22] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[23] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[24] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[25] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[26] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[27]
In 1998 Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[28] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[29]
In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[30]

The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone to hit the North American market in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[31] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smartphones for the next six years.[32] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007.[33] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[34] which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008.[35] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[36] They were also well-known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[37]
In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[38] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted "Game Boy is for 10-year-olds",[39] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[40]
Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[41] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[42]
On 1 June 2006 Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, being replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[43]
In August 2007 Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company's new internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[44] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple's App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[45]
In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[46]
2010–2014[edit]

In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[47] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,[48] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history. [49]
The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[50] However in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[51] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android.
Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iPhone OS and Android. To counter this, Nokia started to develop a Linux-based successor, MeeGo, in 2010. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.[52] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[53][54]
On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer," on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[55] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.
When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[56] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[57] the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[58] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[59] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.

In July 2013, Nokia purchased Siemens' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[60] until being rebranded as simply Nokia Networks shortly after.[61] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[62]
2014–present[edit]
After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia started to focus on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[63]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[64]
On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was "valuable" but "is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently."[65] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[66] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would "look and feel just like Nokia built it."[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[67]
According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[68] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products, and seeking of sales partners.[69] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[70]
On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[71] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be "the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions," with more technologic products expected in the future.[72] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[73] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[74] and is listed on its official website as $40,000. [75]




Nokia office building in North America - originally Alcatel-Lucent's office before the acquisition


On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[76] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[77] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[78][79] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[77][80] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[81] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[82] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[83] but wasn't fully completed until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for €2.8 billion.[84] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[85]
On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[86][87]
On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[88][89] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.[90][91] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.
On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[92] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[93]
On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents.[94]
Operations[edit]
Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[95][96] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[97] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland's GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country's exports in 2006.[98]
Nokia comprises of three business groups.
Nokia Networks[edit]
Nokia Networks, formerly known as Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN), is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. It is the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2011 revenues (after Ericsson, Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent).[99] It has operations in around 150 countries.[100]
The NSN brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[101] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. It provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms, and professional services to operators and service providers.[102] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.
In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it Nokia Networks.[103]
Nokia Technologies[edit]
Nokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops and licenses technology and the Nokia brand.[104] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program. It consists of three labs: Radio Systems Lab, in areas of radio access, wireless local connectivity, and radio implementation; Media Technologies Lab, in areas of multimedia and interaction; and Sensor and Material Technologies Lab, in areas of advanced sensing solutions, interaction methods, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies. Nokia Technologies also provides public participation in its development through the Invent with Nokia program.[105]
In November 2014, Nokia Technologies launched its first product, the Nokia N1 Android 5.0 tablet computer manufactured by Foxconn.[106]
In July 2015, Nokia Technologies introduced a VR camera called OZO, designed for professional content creators and developed in Tampere, Finland. With its 8 synchronized shutter sensors and 8 microphones, the product can capture stereoscopic 3D video and spatial audio.[107][108]
Following May 2016, Nokia Technologies' research and development team acts as the base for future Nokia-branded devices created by HMD Global.
On 31 May 2016, the Digital Health unit was founded. It is led by Cédric Hutchings, former CEO of Withings, which Nokia acquired.[109]
On 31 August 2016, Ramzi Haidamus announced he would be stepping down from his position as president of Nokia Technologies.[110] Brad Rodrigues, previously head of strategy and business development, assumed the role of interim president.[111]
Nokia Bell Labs[edit]
Bell Laboratories became a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation after the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent. It was subsequently renamed Nokia Bell Labs.

Stock[edit]
Nokia is a public limited liability company and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, beginning in 1915.[121] Nokia has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994.[4][121] Nokia shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003, the Paris Stock Exchange in 2004, the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2007 and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2012.[122] Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the CAC 40 index on 6 January 2016.[123]
In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of €110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to €6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to €26.07 billion.
Corporate culture[edit]
Nokia's official corporate culture manifesto, The Nokia Way, emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a flat, networked organization.[124]
The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.
In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation, and Very Human.[124]
In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business. The new values were defined with the key words respect, achievement, renewal and challenge.
Headquarters[edit]




The Nokia House (now Microsoft Talo) was Nokia's head office up until April 2014. The building is located by the Gulf of Finland in Keilaniemi, Espoo, and was constructed between 1995 and 1997. It was the workplace of more than 1,000 Nokia employees.[121]


The Nokia House was the head office building of Nokia Corporation, located in Keilaniemi, Espoo. The two southernmost parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, northernmost part was built in 2000. Around 5000 employees work in the premises.
In December 2012, Nokia announced that it had sold its head office building to Finland-based Exilion for €170 million and was leasing it back on a long term basis.[125] The building was later sold to Microsoft as part of the sale of the mobile phone business in April 2014 and renamed to Microsoft Talo.[126]
Since the sale, Nokia's headquarters are in Karaportti, Espoo, Finland.[127]

Controversies[edit]
NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran[edit]
In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[133] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes."[134]
During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to the use of the interception technology.[135]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[136]
Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran."[137]
Lex Nokia[edit]
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[138] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[139] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently given the required notice.[140]
Nokia–Apple patent dispute[edit]
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[141] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers."[142] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh, and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[141]
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[143] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[144][145]
Alleged tax evasion in India[edit]
Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[146] The unpaid TDS of ₹30 billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[147]

Nokia Corporation[3] (Finnish: Nokia Oyj, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnokiɑ], UK: /ˈnɒkiə/, US: /ˈnoʊkiə/), stylised as NOKIA, is a Finnish multinational communications and information technology company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2014, Nokia employed 61,656 people across 120 countries, did business in more than 150 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €12.73 billion.[2] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world's 274th-largest company measured by 2013 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]
The company has had various industries in its 151-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development, and design licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Nokia's dominance also extended into the smartphone industry through its Symbian platform, but was eventually overshadowed by competitors. Nokia partnered with Microsoft in 2011, agreeing to exclusively use Microsoft's Windows Phone platform on future smartphones; its mobile phone business was eventually bought by Microsoft, in a deal totaling $7.17 billion,[8][9] with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014.[10]
After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).[11][12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through HMD Global.[13]

Main article: History of Nokia
1865–1967[edit]

Nokia has a very long history, dating back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company and called it Nokia, after the site of the second pulp mill. For the next 90 years, Nokia was a forest products and power industry company, with activities such as electricity generation.
In 1922, Nokia entered into a partnership with Finnish Cable Works (Suomen Kaapelitehdas) and Finnish Rubber Works (Suomen Gummitehdas). Finnish Cable Works manufactured telephone and electrical cables, while Finnish Rubber Works made galoshes and other rubber products. The latter company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply. Finnish Cable Works soon did too.
Nokia made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[14]
1967–1990[edit]

In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Finnish Cable Works, and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.
Following Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[15] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
In 1977 Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987 Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) in 1986 before turning to Alcatel.
On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson's Information Systems, which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.
Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.
In 1987, Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

1990–2010[edit]




Jorma Ollila, who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006


Following Simo Vuorilehto's appointment as CEO a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.
Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.
Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900 MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[16]
On 12 June 1996 Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[17] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[18]
Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[19] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[20] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[21]

In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[22] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[23] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[24] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[25] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[26] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[27]
In 1998 Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[28] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[29]
In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[30]

The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone to hit the North American market in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[31] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smartphones for the next six years.[32] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007.[33] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[34] which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008.[35] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[36] They were also well-known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[37]
In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[38] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted "Game Boy is for 10-year-olds",[39] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[40]
Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[41] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[42]
On 1 June 2006 Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, being replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[43]
In August 2007 Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company's new internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[44] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple's App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[45]
In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[46]
2010–2014[edit]

In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[47] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,[48] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history. [49]
The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[50] However in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[51] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android.
Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iPhone OS and Android. To counter this, Nokia started to develop a Linux-based successor, MeeGo, in 2010. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.[52] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[53][54]
On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer," on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[55] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.
When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[56] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[57] the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[58] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[59] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.

In July 2013, Nokia purchased Siemens' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[60] until being rebranded as simply Nokia Networks shortly after.[61] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[62]
2014–present[edit]
After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia started to focus on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[63]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[64]
On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was "valuable" but "is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently."[65] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[66] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would "look and feel just like Nokia built it."[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[67]
According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[68] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products, and seeking of sales partners.[69] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[70]
On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[71] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be "the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions," with more technologic products expected in the future.[72] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[73] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[74] and is listed on its official website as $40,000. [75]




Nokia office building in North America - originally Alcatel-Lucent's office before the acquisition


On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[76] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[77] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[78][79] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[77][80] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[81] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[82] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[83] but wasn't fully completed until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for €2.8 billion.[84] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[85]
On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[86][87]
On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[88][89] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.[90][91] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.
On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[92] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[93]
On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents.[94]
Operations[edit]
Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[95][96] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[97] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland's GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country's exports in 2006.[98]
Nokia comprises of three business groups.
Nokia Networks[edit]
Nokia Networks, formerly known as Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN), is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. It is the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2011 revenues (after Ericsson, Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent).[99] It has operations in around 150 countries.[100]
The NSN brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[101] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. It provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms, and professional services to operators and service providers.[102] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.
In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it Nokia Networks.[103]
Nokia Technologies[edit]
Nokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops and licenses technology and the Nokia brand.[104] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program. It consists of three labs: Radio Systems Lab, in areas of radio access, wireless local connectivity, and radio implementation; Media Technologies Lab, in areas of multimedia and interaction; and Sensor and Material Technologies Lab, in areas of advanced sensing solutions, interaction methods, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies. Nokia Technologies also provides public participation in its development through the Invent with Nokia program.[105]
In November 2014, Nokia Technologies launched its first product, the Nokia N1 Android 5.0 tablet computer manufactured by Foxconn.[106]
In July 2015, Nokia Technologies introduced a VR camera called OZO, designed for professional content creators and developed in Tampere, Finland. With its 8 synchronized shutter sensors and 8 microphones, the product can capture stereoscopic 3D video and spatial audio.[107][108]
Following May 2016, Nokia Technologies' research and development team acts as the base for future Nokia-branded devices created by HMD Global.
On 31 May 2016, the Digital Health unit was founded. It is led by Cédric Hutchings, former CEO of Withings, which Nokia acquired.[109]
On 31 August 2016, Ramzi Haidamus announced he would be stepping down from his position as president of Nokia Technologies.[110] Brad Rodrigues, previously head of strategy and business development, assumed the role of interim president.[111]
Nokia Bell Labs[edit]
Bell Laboratories became a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation after the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent. It was subsequently renamed Nokia Bell Labs.

Stock[edit]
Nokia is a public limited liability company and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, beginning in 1915.[121] Nokia has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994.[4][121] Nokia shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003, the Paris Stock Exchange in 2004, the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2007 and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2012.[122] Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the CAC 40 index on 6 January 2016.[123]
In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of €110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to €6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to €26.07 billion.
Corporate culture[edit]
Nokia's official corporate culture manifesto, The Nokia Way, emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a flat, networked organization.[124]
The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.
In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation, and Very Human.[124]
In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business. The new values were defined with the key words respect, achievement, renewal and challenge.
Headquarters[edit]




The Nokia House (now Microsoft Talo) was Nokia's head office up until April 2014. The building is located by the Gulf of Finland in Keilaniemi, Espoo, and was constructed between 1995 and 1997. It was the workplace of more than 1,000 Nokia employees.[121]


The Nokia House was the head office building of Nokia Corporation, located in Keilaniemi, Espoo. The two southernmost parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, northernmost part was built in 2000. Around 5000 employees work in the premises.
In December 2012, Nokia announced that it had sold its head office building to Finland-based Exilion for €170 million and was leasing it back on a long term basis.[125] The building was later sold to Microsoft as part of the sale of the mobile phone business in April 2014 and renamed to Microsoft Talo.[126]
Since the sale, Nokia's headquarters are in Karaportti, Espoo, Finland.[127]

Controversies[edit]
NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran[edit]
In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[133] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes."[134]
During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to the use of the interception technology.[135]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[136]
Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran."[137]
Lex Nokia[edit]
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[138] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[139] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently given the required notice.[140]
Nokia–Apple patent dispute[edit]
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[141] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers."[142] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh, and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[141]
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[143] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[144][145]
Alleged tax evasion in India[edit]
Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[146] The unpaid TDS of ₹30 billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[147]

Nokia Corporation[3] (Finnish: Nokia Oyj, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnokiɑ], UK: /ˈnɒkiə/, US: /ˈnoʊkiə/), stylised as NOKIA, is a Finnish multinational communications and information technology company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2014, Nokia employed 61,656 people across 120 countries, did business in more than 150 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €12.73 billion.[2] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world's 274th-largest company measured by 2013 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]
The company has had various industries in its 151-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development, and design licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Nokia's dominance also extended into the smartphone industry through its Symbian platform, but was eventually overshadowed by competitors. Nokia partnered with Microsoft in 2011, agreeing to exclusively use Microsoft's Windows Phone platform on future smartphones; its mobile phone business was eventually bought by Microsoft, in a deal totaling $7.17 billion,[8][9] with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014.[10]
After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).[11][12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through HMD Global.[13]

Main article: History of Nokia
1865–1967[edit]

Nokia has a very long history, dating back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company and called it Nokia, after the site of the second pulp mill. For the next 90 years, Nokia was a forest products and power industry company, with activities such as electricity generation.
In 1922, Nokia entered into a partnership with Finnish Cable Works (Suomen Kaapelitehdas) and Finnish Rubber Works (Suomen Gummitehdas). Finnish Cable Works manufactured telephone and electrical cables, while Finnish Rubber Works made galoshes and other rubber products. The latter company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply. Finnish Cable Works soon did too.
Nokia made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[14]
1967–1990[edit]

In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Finnish Cable Works, and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.
Following Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[15] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
In 1977 Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987 Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) in 1986 before turning to Alcatel.
On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson's Information Systems, which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.
Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.
In 1987, Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

1990–2010[edit]




Jorma Ollila, who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006


Following Simo Vuorilehto's appointment as CEO a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.
Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.
Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900 MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[16]
On 12 June 1996 Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[17] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[18]
Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[19] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[20] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[21]

In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[22] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[23] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[24] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[25] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[26] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[27]
In 1998 Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[28] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[29]
In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[30]

The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone to hit the North American market in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[31] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smartphones for the next six years.[32] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007.[33] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[34] which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008.[35] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[36] They were also well-known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[37]
In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[38] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted "Game Boy is for 10-year-olds",[39] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[40]
Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[41] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[42]
On 1 June 2006 Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, being replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[43]
In August 2007 Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company's new internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[44] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple's App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[45]
In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[46]
2010–2014[edit]

In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[47] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,[48] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history. [49]
The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[50] However in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[51] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android.
Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iPhone OS and Android. To counter this, Nokia started to develop a Linux-based successor, MeeGo, in 2010. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.[52] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[53][54]
On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer," on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[55] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.
When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[56] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[57] the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[58] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[59] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.

In July 2013, Nokia purchased Siemens' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[60] until being rebranded as simply Nokia Networks shortly after.[61] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[62]
2014–present[edit]
After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia started to focus on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[63]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[64]
On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was "valuable" but "is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently."[65] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[66] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would "look and feel just like Nokia built it."[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[67]
According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[68] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products, and seeking of sales partners.[69] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[70]
On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[71] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be "the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions," with more technologic products expected in the future.[72] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[73] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[74] and is listed on its official website as $40,000. [75]




Nokia office building in North America - originally Alcatel-Lucent's office before the acquisition


On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[76] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[77] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[78][79] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[77][80] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[81] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[82] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[83] but wasn't fully completed until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for €2.8 billion.[84] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[85]
On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[86][87]
On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[88][89] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.[90][91] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.
On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[92] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[93]
On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents.[94]
Operations[edit]
Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[95][96] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[97] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland's GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country's exports in 2006.[98]
Nokia comprises of three business groups.
Nokia Networks[edit]
Nokia Networks, formerly known as Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN), is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. It is the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2011 revenues (after Ericsson, Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent).[99] It has operations in around 150 countries.[100]
The NSN brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[101] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. It provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms, and professional services to operators and service providers.[102] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.
In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it Nokia Networks.[103]
Nokia Technologies[edit]
Nokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops and licenses technology and the Nokia brand.[104] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program. It consists of three labs: Radio Systems Lab, in areas of radio access, wireless local connectivity, and radio implementation; Media Technologies Lab, in areas of multimedia and interaction; and Sensor and Material Technologies Lab, in areas of advanced sensing solutions, interaction methods, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies. Nokia Technologies also provides public participation in its development through the Invent with Nokia program.[105]
In November 2014, Nokia Technologies launched its first product, the Nokia N1 Android 5.0 tablet computer manufactured by Foxconn.[106]
In July 2015, Nokia Technologies introduced a VR camera called OZO, designed for professional content creators and developed in Tampere, Finland. With its 8 synchronized shutter sensors and 8 microphones, the product can capture stereoscopic 3D video and spatial audio.[107][108]
Following May 2016, Nokia Technologies' research and development team acts as the base for future Nokia-branded devices created by HMD Global.
On 31 May 2016, the Digital Health unit was founded. It is led by Cédric Hutchings, former CEO of Withings, which Nokia acquired.[109]
On 31 August 2016, Ramzi Haidamus announced he would be stepping down from his position as president of Nokia Technologies.[110] Brad Rodrigues, previously head of strategy and business development, assumed the role of interim president.[111]
Nokia Bell Labs[edit]
Bell Laboratories became a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation after the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent. It was subsequently renamed Nokia Bell Labs.

Stock[edit]
Nokia is a public limited liability company and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, beginning in 1915.[121] Nokia has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994.[4][121] Nokia shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003, the Paris Stock Exchange in 2004, the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2007 and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2012.[122] Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the CAC 40 index on 6 January 2016.[123]
In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of €110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to €6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to €26.07 billion.
Corporate culture[edit]
Nokia's official corporate culture manifesto, The Nokia Way, emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a flat, networked organization.[124]
The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.
In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation, and Very Human.[124]
In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business. The new values were defined with the key words respect, achievement, renewal and challenge.
Headquarters[edit]




The Nokia House (now Microsoft Talo) was Nokia's head office up until April 2014. The building is located by the Gulf of Finland in Keilaniemi, Espoo, and was constructed between 1995 and 1997. It was the workplace of more than 1,000 Nokia employees.[121]


The Nokia House was the head office building of Nokia Corporation, located in Keilaniemi, Espoo. The two southernmost parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, northernmost part was built in 2000. Around 5000 employees work in the premises.
In December 2012, Nokia announced that it had sold its head office building to Finland-based Exilion for €170 million and was leasing it back on a long term basis.[125] The building was later sold to Microsoft as part of the sale of the mobile phone business in April 2014 and renamed to Microsoft Talo.[126]
Since the sale, Nokia's headquarters are in Karaportti, Espoo, Finland.[127]

Controversies[edit]
NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran[edit]
In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[133] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes."[134]
During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to the use of the interception technology.[135]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[136]
Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran."[137]
Lex Nokia[edit]
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[138] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[139] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently given the required notice.[140]
Nokia–Apple patent dispute[edit]
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[141] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers."[142] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh, and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[141]
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[143] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[144][145]
Alleged tax evasion in India[edit]
Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[146] The unpaid TDS of ₹30 billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[147]

Nokia Corporation[3] (Finnish: Nokia Oyj, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnokiɑ], UK: /ˈnɒkiə/, US: /ˈnoʊkiə/), stylised as NOKIA, is a Finnish multinational communications and information technology company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2014, Nokia employed 61,656 people across 120 countries, did business in more than 150 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €12.73 billion.[2] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world's 274th-largest company measured by 2013 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]
The company has had various industries in its 151-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development, and design licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Nokia's dominance also extended into the smartphone industry through its Symbian platform, but was eventually overshadowed by competitors. Nokia partnered with Microsoft in 2011, agreeing to exclusively use Microsoft's Windows Phone platform on future smartphones; its mobile phone business was eventually bought by Microsoft, in a deal totaling $7.17 billion,[8][9] with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014.[10]
After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).[11][12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through HMD Global.[13]

Main article: History of Nokia
1865–1967[edit]

Nokia has a very long history, dating back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company and called it Nokia, after the site of the second pulp mill. For the next 90 years, Nokia was a forest products and power industry company, with activities such as electricity generation.
In 1922, Nokia entered into a partnership with Finnish Cable Works (Suomen Kaapelitehdas) and Finnish Rubber Works (Suomen Gummitehdas). Finnish Cable Works manufactured telephone and electrical cables, while Finnish Rubber Works made galoshes and other rubber products. The latter company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply. Finnish Cable Works soon did too.
Nokia made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[14]
1967–1990[edit]

In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Finnish Cable Works, and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.
Following Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[15] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
In 1977 Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987 Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) in 1986 before turning to Alcatel.
On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson's Information Systems, which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.
Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.
In 1987, Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

1990–2010[edit]




Jorma Ollila, who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006


Following Simo Vuorilehto's appointment as CEO a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.
Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.
Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900 MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[16]
On 12 June 1996 Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[17] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[18]
Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[19] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[20] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[21]

In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[22] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[23] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[24] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[25] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[26] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[27]
In 1998 Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[28] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[29]
In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[30]

The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone to hit the North American market in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[31] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smartphones for the next six years.[32] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007.[33] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[34] which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008.[35] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[36] They were also well-known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[37]
In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[38] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted "Game Boy is for 10-year-olds",[39] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[40]
Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[41] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[42]
On 1 June 2006 Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, being replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[43]
In August 2007 Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company's new internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[44] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple's App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[45]
In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[46]
2010–2014[edit]

In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[47] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,[48] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history. [49]
The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[50] However in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[51] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android.
Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iPhone OS and Android. To counter this, Nokia started to develop a Linux-based successor, MeeGo, in 2010. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.[52] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[53][54]
On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer," on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[55] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.
When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[56] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[57] the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[58] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[59] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.

In July 2013, Nokia purchased Siemens' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[60] until being rebranded as simply Nokia Networks shortly after.[61] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[62]
2014–present[edit]
After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia started to focus on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[63]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[64]
On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was "valuable" but "is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently."[65] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[66] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would "look and feel just like Nokia built it."[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[67]
According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[68] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products, and seeking of sales partners.[69] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[70]
On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[71] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be "the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions," with more technologic products expected in the future.[72] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[73] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[74] and is listed on its official website as $40,000. [75]




Nokia office building in North America - originally Alcatel-Lucent's office before the acquisition


On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[76] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[77] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[78][79] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[77][80] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[81] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[82] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[83] but wasn't fully completed until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for €2.8 billion.[84] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[85]
On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[86][87]
On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[88][89] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.[90][91] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.
On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[92] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[93]
On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents.[94]
Operations[edit]
Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[95][96] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[97] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland's GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country's exports in 2006.[98]
Nokia comprises of three business groups.
Nokia Networks[edit]
Nokia Networks, formerly known as Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN), is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. It is the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2011 revenues (after Ericsson, Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent).[99] It has operations in around 150 countries.[100]
The NSN brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[101] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. It provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms, and professional services to operators and service providers.[102] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.
In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it Nokia Networks.[103]
Nokia Technologies[edit]
Nokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops and licenses technology and the Nokia brand.[104] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program. It consists of three labs: Radio Systems Lab, in areas of radio access, wireless local connectivity, and radio implementation; Media Technologies Lab, in areas of multimedia and interaction; and Sensor and Material Technologies Lab, in areas of advanced sensing solutions, interaction methods, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies. Nokia Technologies also provides public participation in its development through the Invent with Nokia program.[105]
In November 2014, Nokia Technologies launched its first product, the Nokia N1 Android 5.0 tablet computer manufactured by Foxconn.[106]
In July 2015, Nokia Technologies introduced a VR camera called OZO, designed for professional content creators and developed in Tampere, Finland. With its 8 synchronized shutter sensors and 8 microphones, the product can capture stereoscopic 3D video and spatial audio.[107][108]
Following May 2016, Nokia Technologies' research and development team acts as the base for future Nokia-branded devices created by HMD Global.
On 31 May 2016, the Digital Health unit was founded. It is led by Cédric Hutchings, former CEO of Withings, which Nokia acquired.[109]
On 31 August 2016, Ramzi Haidamus announced he would be stepping down from his position as president of Nokia Technologies.[110] Brad Rodrigues, previously head of strategy and business development, assumed the role of interim president.[111]
Nokia Bell Labs[edit]
Bell Laboratories became a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation after the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent. It was subsequently renamed Nokia Bell Labs.

Stock[edit]
Nokia is a public limited liability company and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, beginning in 1915.[121] Nokia has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994.[4][121] Nokia shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003, the Paris Stock Exchange in 2004, the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2007 and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2012.[122] Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the CAC 40 index on 6 January 2016.[123]
In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of €110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to €6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to €26.07 billion.
Corporate culture[edit]
Nokia's official corporate culture manifesto, The Nokia Way, emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a flat, networked organization.[124]
The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.
In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation, and Very Human.[124]
In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business. The new values were defined with the key words respect, achievement, renewal and challenge.
Headquarters[edit]




The Nokia House (now Microsoft Talo) was Nokia's head office up until April 2014. The building is located by the Gulf of Finland in Keilaniemi, Espoo, and was constructed between 1995 and 1997. It was the workplace of more than 1,000 Nokia employees.[121]


The Nokia House was the head office building of Nokia Corporation, located in Keilaniemi, Espoo. The two southernmost parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, northernmost part was built in 2000. Around 5000 employees work in the premises.
In December 2012, Nokia announced that it had sold its head office building to Finland-based Exilion for €170 million and was leasing it back on a long term basis.[125] The building was later sold to Microsoft as part of the sale of the mobile phone business in April 2014 and renamed to Microsoft Talo.[126]
Since the sale, Nokia's headquarters are in Karaportti, Espoo, Finland.[127]

Controversies[edit]
NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran[edit]
In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[133] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes."[134]
During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to the use of the interception technology.[135]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[136]
Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran."[137]
Lex Nokia[edit]
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[138] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[139] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently given the required notice.[140]
Nokia–Apple patent dispute[edit]
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[141] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers."[142] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh, and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[141]
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[143] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[144][145]
Alleged tax evasion in India[edit]
Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[146] The unpaid TDS of ₹30 billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[147]

Nokia Corporation[3] (Finnish: Nokia Oyj, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnokiɑ], UK: /ˈnɒkiə/, US: /ˈnoʊkiə/), stylised as NOKIA, is a Finnish multinational communications and information technology company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2014, Nokia employed 61,656 people across 120 countries, did business in more than 150 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €12.73 billion.[2] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world's 274th-largest company measured by 2013 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]
The company has had various industries in its 151-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development, and design licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Nokia's dominance also extended into the smartphone industry through its Symbian platform, but was eventually overshadowed by competitors. Nokia partnered with Microsoft in 2011, agreeing to exclusively use Microsoft's Windows Phone platform on future smartphones; its mobile phone business was eventually bought by Microsoft, in a deal totaling $7.17 billion,[8][9] with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014.[10]
After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).[11][12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through HMD Global.[13]

Main article: History of Nokia
1865–1967[edit]

Nokia has a very long history, dating back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company and called it Nokia, after the site of the second pulp mill. For the next 90 years, Nokia was a forest products and power industry company, with activities such as electricity generation.
In 1922, Nokia entered into a partnership with Finnish Cable Works (Suomen Kaapelitehdas) and Finnish Rubber Works (Suomen Gummitehdas). Finnish Cable Works manufactured telephone and electrical cables, while Finnish Rubber Works made galoshes and other rubber products. The latter company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply. Finnish Cable Works soon did too.
Nokia made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[14]
1967–1990[edit]

In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Finnish Cable Works, and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.
Following Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[15] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
In 1977 Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987 Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) in 1986 before turning to Alcatel.
On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson's Information Systems, which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.
Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.
In 1987, Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

1990–2010[edit]




Jorma Ollila, who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006


Following Simo Vuorilehto's appointment as CEO a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.
Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.
Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900 MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[16]
On 12 June 1996 Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[17] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[18]
Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[19] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[20] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[21]

In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[22] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[23] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[24] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[25] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[26] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[27]
In 1998 Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[28] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[29]
In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[30]

The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone to hit the North American market in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[31] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smartphones for the next six years.[32] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007.[33] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[34] which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008.[35] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[36] They were also well-known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[37]
In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[38] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted "Game Boy is for 10-year-olds",[39] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[40]
Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[41] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[42]
On 1 June 2006 Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, being replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[43]
In August 2007 Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company's new internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[44] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple's App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[45]
In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[46]
2010–2014[edit]

In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[47] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,[48] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history. [49]
The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[50] However in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[51] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android.
Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iPhone OS and Android. To counter this, Nokia started to develop a Linux-based successor, MeeGo, in 2010. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.[52] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[53][54]
On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer," on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[55] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.
When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[56] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[57] the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[58] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[59] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.

In July 2013, Nokia purchased Siemens' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[60] until being rebranded as simply Nokia Networks shortly after.[61] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[62]
2014–present[edit]
After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia started to focus on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[63]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[64]
On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was "valuable" but "is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently."[65] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[66] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would "look and feel just like Nokia built it."[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[67]
According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[68] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products, and seeking of sales partners.[69] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[70]
On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[71] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be "the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions," with more technologic products expected in the future.[72] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[73] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[74] and is listed on its official website as $40,000. [75]




Nokia office building in North America - originally Alcatel-Lucent's office before the acquisition


On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[76] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[77] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[78][79] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[77][80] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[81] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[82] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[83] but wasn't fully completed until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for €2.8 billion.[84] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[85]
On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[86][87]
On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[88][89] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.[90][91] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.
On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[92] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[93]
On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents.[94]
Operations[edit]
Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[95][96] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[97] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland's GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country's exports in 2006.[98]
Nokia comprises of three business groups.
Nokia Networks[edit]
Nokia Networks, formerly known as Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN), is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. It is the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2011 revenues (after Ericsson, Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent).[99] It has operations in around 150 countries.[100]
The NSN brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[101] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. It provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms, and professional services to operators and service providers.[102] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.
In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it Nokia Networks.[103]
Nokia Technologies[edit]
Nokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops and licenses technology and the Nokia brand.[104] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program. It consists of three labs: Radio Systems Lab, in areas of radio access, wireless local connectivity, and radio implementation; Media Technologies Lab, in areas of multimedia and interaction; and Sensor and Material Technologies Lab, in areas of advanced sensing solutions, interaction methods, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies. Nokia Technologies also provides public participation in its development through the Invent with Nokia program.[105]
In November 2014, Nokia Technologies launched its first product, the Nokia N1 Android 5.0 tablet computer manufactured by Foxconn.[106]
In July 2015, Nokia Technologies introduced a VR camera called OZO, designed for professional content creators and developed in Tampere, Finland. With its 8 synchronized shutter sensors and 8 microphones, the product can capture stereoscopic 3D video and spatial audio.[107][108]
Following May 2016, Nokia Technologies' research and development team acts as the base for future Nokia-branded devices created by HMD Global.
On 31 May 2016, the Digital Health unit was founded. It is led by Cédric Hutchings, former CEO of Withings, which Nokia acquired.[109]
On 31 August 2016, Ramzi Haidamus announced he would be stepping down from his position as president of Nokia Technologies.[110] Brad Rodrigues, previously head of strategy and business development, assumed the role of interim president.[111]
Nokia Bell Labs[edit]
Bell Laboratories became a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation after the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent. It was subsequently renamed Nokia Bell Labs.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Corporate governance[edit]
The control and management of Nokia is divided among the shareholders at a general meeting and the Nokia Leadership Team (left),[112] under the direction of the board of directors (right).[113] The chairman and the rest of the Nokia Leadership Team members are appointed by the board of directors. Only the Chairman of the Nokia Leadership Team can belong to both the board of directors and the Nokia Leadership Team.

Stock[edit]
Nokia is a public limited liability company and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, beginning in 1915.[121] Nokia has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994.[4][121] Nokia shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003, the Paris Stock Exchange in 2004, the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2007 and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2012.[122] Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the CAC 40 index on 6 January 2016.[123]
In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of €110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to €6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to €26.07 billion.
Corporate culture[edit]
Nokia's official corporate culture manifesto, The Nokia Way, emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a flat, networked organization.[124]
The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.
In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation, and Very Human.[124]
In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business. The new values were defined with the key words respect, achievement, renewal and challenge.
Headquarters[edit]




The Nokia House (now Microsoft Talo) was Nokia's head office up until April 2014. The building is located by the Gulf of Finland in Keilaniemi, Espoo, and was constructed between 1995 and 1997. It was the workplace of more than 1,000 Nokia employees.[121]


The Nokia House was the head office building of Nokia Corporation, located in Keilaniemi, Espoo. The two southernmost parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, northernmost part was built in 2000. Around 5000 employees work in the premises.
In December 2012, Nokia announced that it had sold its head office building to Finland-based Exilion for €170 million and was leasing it back on a long term basis.[125] The building was later sold to Microsoft as part of the sale of the mobile phone business in April 2014 and renamed to Microsoft Talo.[126]
Since the sale, Nokia's headquarters are in Karaportti, Espoo, Finland.[127]

Controversies[edit]
NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran[edit]
In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[133] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes."[134]
During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to the use of the interception technology.[135]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[136]
Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran."[137]
Lex Nokia[edit]
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[138] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[139] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently given the required notice.[140]
Nokia–Apple patent dispute[edit]
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[141] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers."[142] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh, and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[141]
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[143] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[144][145]
Alleged tax evasion in India[edit]
Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[146] The unpaid TDS of ₹30 billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[147]

  Home  Stock Market News  Nokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) Incorporates Withings Products Into Its E-Health Re-Launch     Stock Market News  Nokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK) Incorporates Withings Products Into Its E-Health Re-Launch  ByAndy Parker -March 1, 2017 117  Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter


 The Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last weekend had a huge turnout.  Of the many in attendance was Nokia Corp (ADR)(NYSE:NOK), which has made some headlines recently. It is now back to innovation with its push for inclusion of e-health products into its portfolio.
The acquiring of Withings by Nokia last year was to set a pace for entry into consumer e-health. The French company is a smart device maker for activity-tracking watches, smart scales, and wellness monitoring devices. After all its efforts, the Finnish is now ready to re-launch every Withings product with its brand.
Nokia brand rebound
There is a notable increase of partnerships of companies in every industry and so is the healthcare industry. Apparently, electronics companies are showing more interest in these partnerships and particularly within the healthcare space.
Nokia is one the progressive companies in regards to innovation and connectivity. VP of Digital Health, Nokia, Cedric Hutchings notes, “With the full power of a brand recognized for trust, reliability, and quality, we will reach more people and impact more lives to help the human family be healthier together.”
Bu Nokia has an additional health initiative
Both Nokia and Withings share a common vision of inspiring people to be in charge of their own health. However, Nokia is also adopting another health initiative; the Patient Care Platform with an aim of creating a cohesive relationship between doctors and patients. The platform is more or less the next-level version of Apple’s Care kit.
Using their smart devices, healthcare professionals can easily and remotely monitor their patients. This will help them manage their patient’s chronic conditions; hence they will not need to make unnecessary office visits and hospitalizations.
The platform is currently under a 69,000-person study in the UK where it is in use by the National Health Service. Meanwhile, Nokia’s stock closed at $5.14 a fall of $0.04 or 0.77%.

Nokia's stock jumps to 16-month high after settlement deal with Apple
Shares of Nokia Corp.  jumped 5.1% toward a 16-month high in midday trade Tuesday, as investors cheered the news that the Finland-based network infrastructure company said it would receive and upfront cash payment and additional payments from Apple Inc.  as part of the settlements of lawsuits against each other. The deal allows Apple to resume selling Nokia's digital health products in Apple stores. Canaccord Genuity analyst T. Michael Walkley raised his stock price target on Nokia to $7.00 from $5.50. Since the settlement came much sooner than his expectation that it would take "well into 2018," he added back about 250 million euro worth ($280.2 million) of licensing revenue from Apple into his estimates for 2018, leading to the higher stock price target. Walkley said the settlement also removes 100 million euro ($112.1 million) in annual legal costs. Nokia's stock, which has run up 35% year to date, was on track for the highest close since Jan. 29, 2016. In comparison, Apple's stock has rallied 33% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has gained 6.0%.

Nokia Corporation[3] (Finnish: Nokia Oyj, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnokiɑ], UK: /ˈnɒkiə/, US: /ˈnoʊkiə/), stylised as NOKIA, is a Finnish multinational communications and information technology company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2014, Nokia employed 61,656 people across 120 countries, did business in more than 150 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €12.73 billion.[2] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world's 274th-largest company measured by 2013 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]
The company has had various industries in its 151-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development, and design licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Nokia's dominance also extended into the smartphone industry through its Symbian platform, but was eventually overshadowed by competitors. Nokia partnered with Microsoft in 2011, agreeing to exclusively use Microsoft's Windows Phone platform on future smartphones; its mobile phone business was eventually bought by Microsoft, in a deal totaling $7.17 billion,[8][9] with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014.[10]
After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).[11][12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through HMD Global.[13]

Main article: History of Nokia
1865–1967[edit]




Rolls of toilet paper produced by Nokia in the 1960s, Museum Centre Vapriikki, Tampere


Nokia has a very long history, dating back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company and called it Nokia, after the site of the second pulp mill. For the next 90 years, Nokia was a forest products and power industry company, with activities such as electricity generation.
In 1922, Nokia entered into a partnership with Finnish Cable Works (Suomen Kaapelitehdas) and Finnish Rubber Works (Suomen Gummitehdas). Finnish Cable Works manufactured telephone and electrical cables, while Finnish Rubber Works made galoshes and other rubber products. The latter company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply. Finnish Cable Works soon did too.
Nokia made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[14]
1967–1990[edit]

In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Finnish Cable Works, and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.
Following Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[15] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
In 1977 Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987 Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) in 1986 before turning to Alcatel.
On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson's Information Systems, which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.
Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.
In 1987, Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

Following Simo Vuorilehto's appointment as CEO a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.
Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.
Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900 MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[16]
On 12 June 1996 Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[17] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[18]
Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[19] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[20] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[21]

In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[22] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[23] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[24] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[25] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[26] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[27]
In 1998 Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[28] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[29]
In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[30]

The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone to hit the North American market in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[31] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smartphones for the next six years.[32] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007.[33] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[34] which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008.[35] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[36] They were also well-known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[37]
In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[38] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted "Game Boy is for 10-year-olds",[39] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[40]
Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[41] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[42]
On 1 June 2006 Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, being replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[43]
In August 2007 Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company's new internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[44] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple's App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[45]
In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[46]
2010–2014[edit]

In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[47] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,[48] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history. [49]
The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[50] However in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[51] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android.
Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iPhone OS and Android. To counter this, Nokia started to develop a Linux-based successor, MeeGo, in 2010. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.[52] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[53][54]
On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer," on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[55] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.
When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[56] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[57] the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[58] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[59] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.

In July 2013, Nokia purchased Siemens' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[60] until being rebranded as simply Nokia Networks shortly after.[61] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[62]
2014–present[edit]
After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia started to focus on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[63]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[64]
On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was "valuable" but "is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently."[65] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[66] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would "look and feel just like Nokia built it."[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[67]
According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[68] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products, and seeking of sales partners.[69] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[70]
On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[71] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be "the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions," with more technologic products expected in the future.[72] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[73] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[74] and is listed on its official website as $40,000. [75]




Nokia office building in North America - originally Alcatel-Lucent's office before the acquisition


On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[76] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[77] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[78][79] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[77][80] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[81] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[82] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[83] but wasn't fully completed until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for €2.8 billion.[84] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[85]
On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[86][87]
On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[88][89] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.[90][91] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.
On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[92] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[93]
On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents.[94]
Operations[edit]
Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[95][96] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[97] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland's GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country's exports in 2006.[98]
Nokia comprises of three business groups.
Nokia Networks[edit]
Nokia Networks, formerly known as Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN), is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. It is the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2011 revenues (after Ericsson, Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent).[99] It has operations in around 150 countries.[100]
The NSN brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[101] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. It provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms, and professional services to operators and service providers.[102] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.
In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it Nokia Networks.[103]
Nokia Technologies[edit]
Nokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops and licenses technology and the Nokia brand.[104] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program. It consists of three labs: Radio Systems Lab, in areas of radio access, wireless local connectivity, and radio implementation; Media Technologies Lab, in areas of multimedia and interaction; and Sensor and Material Technologies Lab, in areas of advanced sensing solutions, interaction methods, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies. Nokia Technologies also provides public participation in its development through the Invent with Nokia program.[105]
In November 2014, Nokia Technologies launched its first product, the Nokia N1 Android 5.0 tablet computer manufactured by Foxconn.[106]
In July 2015, Nokia Technologies introduced a VR camera called OZO, designed for professional content creators and developed in Tampere, Finland. With its 8 synchronized shutter sensors and 8 microphones, the product can capture stereoscopic 3D video and spatial audio.[107][108]
Following May 2016, Nokia Technologies' research and development team acts as the base for future Nokia-branded devices created by HMD Global.
On 31 May 2016, the Digital Health unit was founded. It is led by Cédric Hutchings, former CEO of Withings, which Nokia acquired.[109]
On 31 August 2016, Ramzi Haidamus announced he would be stepping down from his position as president of Nokia Technologies.[110] Brad Rodrigues, previously head of strategy and business development, assumed the role of interim president.[111]
Nokia Bell Labs[edit]
Bell Laboratories became a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation after the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent. It was subsequently renamed Nokia Bell Labs.

Stock[edit]
Nokia is a public limited liability company and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, beginning in 1915.[121] Nokia has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994.[4][121] Nokia shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003, the Paris Stock Exchange in 2004, the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2007 and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2012.[122] Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the CAC 40 index on 6 January 2016.[123]
In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of €110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to €6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to €26.07 billion.
Corporate culture[edit]
Nokia's official corporate culture manifesto, The Nokia Way, emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a flat, networked organization.[124]
The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.
In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation, and Very Human.[124]
In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business. The new values were defined with the key words respect, achievement, renewal and challenge.
Headquarters[edit]




The Nokia House (now Microsoft Talo) was Nokia's head office up until April 2014. The building is located by the Gulf of Finland in Keilaniemi, Espoo, and was constructed between 1995 and 1997. It was the workplace of more than 1,000 Nokia employees.[121]


The Nokia House was the head office building of Nokia Corporation, located in Keilaniemi, Espoo. The two southernmost parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, northernmost part was built in 2000. Around 5000 employees work in the premises.
In December 2012, Nokia announced that it had sold its head office building to Finland-based Exilion for €170 million and was leasing it back on a long term basis.[125] The building was later sold to Microsoft as part of the sale of the mobile phone business in April 2014 and renamed to Microsoft Talo.[126]
Since the sale, Nokia's headquarters are in Karaportti, Espoo, Finland.[127]

Controversies[edit]
NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran[edit]
In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[133] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes."[134]
During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to the use of the interception technology.[135]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[136]
Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran."[137]
Lex Nokia[edit]
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[138] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[139] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently given the required notice.[140]
Nokia–Apple patent dispute[edit]
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[141] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers."[142] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh, and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[141]
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[143] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[144][145]
Alleged tax evasion in India[edit]
Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[146] The unpaid TDS of ₹30 billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[147]

Nokia Corporation[3] (Finnish: Nokia Oyj, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnokiɑ], UK: /ˈnɒkiə/, US: /ˈnoʊkiə/), stylised as NOKIA, is a Finnish multinational communications and information technology company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2014, Nokia employed 61,656 people across 120 countries, did business in more than 150 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €12.73 billion.[2] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world's 274th-largest company measured by 2013 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]
The company has had various industries in its 151-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development, and design licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Nokia's dominance also extended into the smartphone industry through its Symbian platform, but was eventually overshadowed by competitors. Nokia partnered with Microsoft in 2011, agreeing to exclusively use Microsoft's Windows Phone platform on future smartphones; its mobile phone business was eventually bought by Microsoft, in a deal totaling $7.17 billion,[8][9] with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014.[10]
After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).[11][12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through HMD Global.[13]

Main article: History of Nokia
1865–1967[edit]

Nokia has a very long history, dating back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company and called it Nokia, after the site of the second pulp mill. For the next 90 years, Nokia was a forest products and power industry company, with activities such as electricity generation.
In 1922, Nokia entered into a partnership with Finnish Cable Works (Suomen Kaapelitehdas) and Finnish Rubber Works (Suomen Gummitehdas). Finnish Cable Works manufactured telephone and electrical cables, while Finnish Rubber Works made galoshes and other rubber products. The latter company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply. Finnish Cable Works soon did too.
Nokia made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[14]
1967–1990[edit]

In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Finnish Cable Works, and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.
Following Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[15] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
In 1977 Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987 Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) in 1986 before turning to Alcatel.
On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson's Information Systems, which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.
Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.
In 1987, Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

1990–2010[edit]




Jorma Ollila, who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006


Following Simo Vuorilehto's appointment as CEO a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.
Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.
Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900 MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[16]
On 12 June 1996 Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[17] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[18]
Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[19] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[20] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[21]

In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[22] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[23] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[24] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[25] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[26] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[27]
In 1998 Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[28] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[29]
In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[30]

The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone to hit the North American market in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[31] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smartphones for the next six years.[32] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007.[33] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[34] which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008.[35] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[36] They were also well-known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[37]
In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[38] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted "Game Boy is for 10-year-olds",[39] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[40]
Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[41] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[42]
On 1 June 2006 Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, being replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[43]
In August 2007 Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company's new internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[44] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple's App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[45]
In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[46]
2010–2014[edit]

In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[47] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,[48] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history. [49]
The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[50] However in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[51] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android.
Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iPhone OS and Android. To counter this, Nokia started to develop a Linux-based successor, MeeGo, in 2010. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.[52] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[53][54]
On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer," on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[55] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.
When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[56] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[57] the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[58] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[59] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.

In July 2013, Nokia purchased Siemens' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[60] until being rebranded as simply Nokia Networks shortly after.[61] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[62]
2014–present[edit]
After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia started to focus on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[63]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[64]
On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was "valuable" but "is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently."[65] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[66] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would "look and feel just like Nokia built it."[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[67]
According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[68] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products, and seeking of sales partners.[69] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[70]
On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[71] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be "the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions," with more technologic products expected in the future.[72] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[73] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[74] and is listed on its official website as $40,000. [75]

On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[76] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[77] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[78][79] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[77][80] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[81] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[82] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[83] but wasn't fully completed until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for €2.8 billion.[84] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[85]
On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[86][87]
On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[88][89] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.[90][91] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.
On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[92] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[93]
On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents.[94]
Operations[edit]
Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[95][96] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[97] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland's GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country's exports in 2006.[98]
Nokia comprises of three business groups.
Nokia Networks[edit]
Nokia Networks, formerly known as Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN), is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. It is the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2011 revenues (after Ericsson, Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent).[99] It has operations in around 150 countries.[100]
The NSN brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[101] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. It provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms, and professional services to operators and service providers.[102] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.
In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it Nokia Networks.[103]
Nokia Technologies[edit]
Nokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops and licenses technology and the Nokia brand.[104] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program. It consists of three labs: Radio Systems Lab, in areas of radio access, wireless local connectivity, and radio implementation; Media Technologies Lab, in areas of multimedia and interaction; and Sensor and Material Technologies Lab, in areas of advanced sensing solutions, interaction methods, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies. Nokia Technologies also provides public participation in its development through the Invent with Nokia program.[105]
In November 2014, Nokia Technologies launched its first product, the Nokia N1 Android 5.0 tablet computer manufactured by Foxconn.[106]
In July 2015, Nokia Technologies introduced a VR camera called OZO, designed for professional content creators and developed in Tampere, Finland. With its 8 synchronized shutter sensors and 8 microphones, the product can capture stereoscopic 3D video and spatial audio.[107][108]
Following May 2016, Nokia Technologies' research and development team acts as the base for future Nokia-branded devices created by HMD Global.
On 31 May 2016, the Digital Health unit was founded. It is led by Cédric Hutchings, former CEO of Withings, which Nokia acquired.[109]
On 31 August 2016, Ramzi Haidamus announced he would be stepping down from his position as president of Nokia Technologies.[110] Brad Rodrigues, previously head of strategy and business development, assumed the role of interim president.[111]
Nokia Bell Labs[edit]
Bell Laboratories became a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation after the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent. It was subsequently renamed Nokia Bell Labs.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Corporate governance[edit]
The control and management of Nokia is divided among the shareholders at a general meeting and the Nokia Leadership Team (left),[112] under the direction of the board of directors (right).[113] The chairman and the rest of the Nokia Leadership Team members are appointed by the board of directors. Only the Chairman of the Nokia Leadership Team can belong to both the board of directors and the Nokia Leadership Team. The board of directors' committees consist of the Audit Committee,[114] the Personnel Committee,[115] and the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee.[116][117]

Stock[edit]
Nokia is a public limited liability company and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, beginning in 1915.[121] Nokia has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994.[4][121] Nokia shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003, the Paris Stock Exchange in 2004, the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2007 and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2012.[122] Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the CAC 40 index on 6 January 2016.[123]
In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of €110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to €6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to €26.07 billion.
Corporate culture[edit]
Nokia's official corporate culture manifesto, The Nokia Way, emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a flat, networked organization.[124]
The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.
In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation, and Very Human.[124]
In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business. The new values were defined with the key words respect, achievement, renewal and challenge.
Headquarters[edit]




The Nokia House (now Microsoft Talo) was Nokia's head office up until April 2014. The building is located by the Gulf of Finland in Keilaniemi, Espoo, and was constructed between 1995 and 1997. It was the workplace of more than 1,000 Nokia employees.[121]


The Nokia House was the head office building of Nokia Corporation, located in Keilaniemi, Espoo. The two southernmost parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, northernmost part was built in 2000. Around 5000 employees work in the premises.
In December 2012, Nokia announced that it had sold its head office building to Finland-based Exilion for €170 million and was leasing it back on a long term basis.[125] The building was later sold to Microsoft as part of the sale of the mobile phone business in April 2014 and renamed to Microsoft Talo.[126]
Since the sale, Nokia's headquarters are in Karaportti, Espoo, Finland.[127]

Controversies[edit]
NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran[edit]
In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[133] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes."[134]
During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to the use of the interception technology.[135]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[136]
Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran."[137]
Lex Nokia[edit]
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[138] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[139] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently given the required notice.[140]
Nokia–Apple patent dispute[edit]
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[141] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers."[142] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh, and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[141]
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[143] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[144][145]
Alleged tax evasion in India[edit]
Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[146] The unpaid TDS of ₹30 billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[147]

Nokia Corporation[3] (Finnish: Nokia Oyj, Finnish pronunciation: [ˈnokiɑ], UK: /ˈnɒkiə/, US: /ˈnoʊkiə/), stylised as NOKIA, is a Finnish multinational communications and information technology company, founded in 1865. Nokia's headquarters are in Espoo, Uusimaa, in the greater Helsinki metropolitan area.[1] In 2014, Nokia employed 61,656 people across 120 countries, did business in more than 150 countries, and reported annual revenues of around €12.73 billion.[2] Nokia is a public limited company listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange.[4] It is the world's 274th-largest company measured by 2013 revenues according to the Fortune Global 500, and is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[5][6]
The company has had various industries in its 151-year history. It was founded as a pulp mill, but since the 1990s focuses on large-scale telecommunications infrastructures, technology development, and design licensing.[7] Nokia is also a major contributor to the mobile telephony industry, having assisted in the development of the GSM and LTE standards, and was, for a period, the largest vendor of mobile phones in the world. Nokia's dominance also extended into the smartphone industry through its Symbian platform, but was eventually overshadowed by competitors. Nokia partnered with Microsoft in 2011, agreeing to exclusively use Microsoft's Windows Phone platform on future smartphones; its mobile phone business was eventually bought by Microsoft, in a deal totaling $7.17 billion,[8][9] with Microsoft Mobile formed as the business' successor when the deal was completed on 25 April 2014.[10]
After the sale of its mobile phone business, Nokia began to focus more extensively on its telecommunications infrastructure business, marked by the divestiture of its Here Maps division and the acquisition of French telecommunications giant Alcatel-Lucent. Nokia also entered virtual reality and digital health (the latter by purchasing Withings).[11][12] The Nokia brand has since returned to the mobile and smartphone market through HMD Global.[13]

Main article: History of Nokia
1865–1967[edit]

Nokia has a very long history, dating back to 1865, when Finnish-Swede mining engineer Fredrik Idestam established a pulp mill near the town of Tampere, Finland (then in the Russian Empire). A second pulp mill was opened in 1868 near the neighboring town of Nokia. In 1871, Idestam, together with friend Leo Mechelin, formed a shared company and called it Nokia, after the site of the second pulp mill. For the next 90 years, Nokia was a forest products and power industry company, with activities such as electricity generation.
In 1922, Nokia entered into a partnership with Finnish Cable Works (Suomen Kaapelitehdas) and Finnish Rubber Works (Suomen Gummitehdas). Finnish Cable Works manufactured telephone and electrical cables, while Finnish Rubber Works made galoshes and other rubber products. The latter company grew rapidly when it moved to the Nokia region in the 1930s to take advantage of the electrical power supply. Finnish Cable Works soon did too.
Nokia made respirators for both civilian and military use, from the 1930s well into the early 1990s.[14]
1967–1990[edit]

In 1967, the three companies - Nokia, Finnish Cable Works, and Finnish Rubber Works - merged and created the new Nokia Corporation, a new restructured form divided into four major businesses: forestry, cable, rubber and electronics. In the early 1970s, it entered the networking and radio industry. Nokia also started making military equipment for Finland's defence forces (Puolustusvoimat), such as the Sanomalaite M/90 communicator in 1983, and the M61 gas mask first developed in the 1960s. Nokia was now also making professional mobile radios, telephone switches, capacitors and chemicals.
Following Finland's trade agreement with the Soviet Union in the 1960s, Nokia expanded into the Soviet market. It soon widened trade, ranging from automatic telephone exchanges to robotics amongst others, and by the late 1970s the Soviet Union became a major market for Nokia, helping to yield in high profits. Nokia was also co-operating on scientific-technology with the Soviets. Following the end of the Cold War détente in the early 1980s, the U.S. government became increasingly suspicious about the technologic co-operation between Nokia and its Soviet partners. However Nokia was importing many American components that were then used for the Soviets, and according to U.S. Deputy Minister of Defence, Richard Perle, Nokia had a secret co-operation with the Pentagon that allowed the U.S. to keep track in technologic developments in the Soviet Union through trading with Nokia.[15] However this was a demonstration of Finland trading with both sides, as it was neutral during the Cold War.
In 1977 Kari Kairamo became CEO and he transformed the company's businesses. By this time Finland were becoming what has been called "Nordic Japan". Under his leadership Nokia acquired many companies. In 1984, Nokia acquired television maker Salora, followed by Swedish electronics and computer maker Luxor AB in 1985, and French television maker Oceanic in 1987. This made Nokia the third-largest television manufacturer of Europe (behind Philips and Thomson). The existing brands continued to be used until the end of the television business in 1996.

In 1987 Nokia acquired Schaub-Lorenz, the consumer operations of Germany's Standard Elektrik Lorenz (SEL), which included its "Schaub-Lorenz" and "Graetz" brands. It was originally part of American conglomerate International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) and after the acquisition products were sold under the "ITT Nokia" brand, despite SEL's sale to Compagnie Générale d'Electricité (CGE) in 1986 before turning to Alcatel.
On 1 April 1988 Nokia bought the computer division of Ericsson's Information Systems, which originated as a computer division of Swedish aircraft and car manufacturer Saab called Datasaab. Ericsson Information Systems made Alfaskop terminals, typewriters, minicomputers and Ericsson IBM compatible PCs. The merge with Nokia's existing Information Systems division - which already had a line of personal computers called MikroMikko since 1981 - resulted in the name Nokia Data.
Nokia also acquired Mobira, a mobile telephony company, which was the foundation of its future mobile phones business. In 1981, Mobira launched the Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT) service, the world's first international cellular network and the first to allow international roaming. In 1982, Mobira launched the Mobira Senator car phone, Nokia's first mobile phone. At that time, the company had no interest in producing mobile phones, which the executive board regarded as akin to James Bond's gadgets - improbably futuristic and niche devices. After all these acquisitions Nokia's revenue base became US$2.7 billion. Tragically Kairamo committed suicide on 11 December 1988.
In 1987, Kaapelitehdas (Finnish Cable Works) discontinued production of cables at its Helsinki factory, effectively shutting down the sub-company.

1990–2010[edit]




Jorma Ollila, who oversaw the rise of Nokia in the mobile phone market as CEO from 1992 to 2006


Following Simo Vuorilehto's appointment as CEO a major restructuring was planned. With 11 groups within the company, Vuorilehto divested industrial units he deemed as un-strategic. Nokian Tyres (Nokian Renkaat), a tyre producer originally formed as a division of Finnish Rubber Works in 1932, split away from Nokia Corporation in 1988. Two years later, in 1990, Finnish Rubber Works followed suit. In 1991 Nokia sold its computer division, Nokia Data, to UK-based International Computers Limited (ICL), the precursor of Fujitsu Siemens. Investors thought of this as financial trouble and Nokia's stock price sunk as a result. Finland was now also experiencing its worst recession in living memory, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, a major customer, made matters worse.
Vuorilehto quit in early 1992 and was replaced by Jorma Ollila. He saw that despite troubles in the economy, Nokia's cellular business was booming. As a result he decided to focus on wireless telecommunications and to get rid of non-core assets. This strategy proved to be very successful and the company grew rapidly in the following years.
Nokia's first fully portable mobile phone after the Mobira Senator was the Mobira Cityman 900 in 1987. Nokia assisted in the development of the GSM mobile standard in the 1980s, and developed the first GSM network with Siemens, the predecessor to Nokia Siemens Network. The world's first GSM call was made by Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri on 1 July 1991, using Nokia equipment on the 900 MHz band network built by Nokia and operated by Radiolinja. In November 1992, the Nokia 1011 launched, making it the first commercially available GSM mobile phone.[16]
On 12 June 1996 Nokia announced the sale of its television business to Canada-based Semi-Tech Corporation.[17] The television manufacturing plant in Germany closed down in September 1996. The sale included the rights to use the Nokia, Finlux, Luxor, Salora, Schaub-Lorenz and Oceanic brands until the end of 1999.[18]
Nokia was the first to launch digital satellite receivers in the UK, announced in March 1997.[19] In August 1997 Nokia introduced the first digital satellite receiver with Common Interface (CI) support.[20] In 1998 Nokia became the chosen supplier to produce the world's first digital terrestrial television set-top boxes by British Digital Broadcasting (BDB), which was eventually launched as ONdigital.[21]

In October 1998, Nokia overtook Motorola to become the best-selling mobile phone brand,[22] and in December manufactured its 100 millionth mobile phone.[23] Nokia's mobile phones became highly successful in Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania. They were also one of the pioneers of mobile gaming due to the popularity of Snake, which came pre-loaded on many products. The 3310 is one of the company's most well-known products. Nokia also created the best-selling mobile phone of all time, the Nokia 1100, in 2003.
Nokia claimed in April 1996 its 447Xav and 447K monitors to be the first with stereo speakers and a sub-woofer.[24] In May 1999 Nokia introduced their first wireless LAN products.[25] In January 2000 ViewSonic acquired Nokia Display Products, the division making displays for personal computers.[26] On 26 April 2001 Nokia partnered with Telefonica to supply DSL modems and routers in Spain.[27]
In 1998 Nokia co-founded Symbian Ltd. led by Psion to create a new operating system for PDAs as a successor of EPOC32. In 2001 Nokia created the Series 60 platform on Symbian OS, later introducing it with their first camera phone, the Nokia 7650. Both Nokia and Symbian eventually became the largest smartphone hardware and software maker respectively, and in February 2004 became the largest shareholder of Symbian Ltd.[28] Nokia acquired the entire company in June 2008 and then formed the Symbian Foundation as its successor.[29]
In 1998 alone, the company had sales revenue of $20 billion making $2.6 billion profit. By 2000 Nokia employed over 55,000 people.[30]

The Nokia 3600/3650 was the first camera phone to hit the North American market in 2003. The company would go on to become a successful and innovative camera phone maker. In April 2005 Nokia partnered with German camera optics maker Carl Zeiss AG.[31] That same month Nokia introduced the Nseries, which would become its flagship line of smartphones for the next six years.[32] The Nokia N95 introduced in September 2006 became highly successful and was also awarded as "best mobile imaging device" in Europe in 2007.[33] Its successor the N82 featured a xenon flash,[34] which helped it win the award of "best mobile imaging" device in Europe in 2008.[35] The N93 in 2006 was known for its specialized camcorder and the twistable design that switches between clamshell and a camcorder-like position.[36] They were also well-known for the N8 with a high resolution 12-megapixel sensor in 2010; the 808 PureView in 2012 with a 41-megapixel sensor; and the Lumia 920 flagship in 2012 which implemented advanced PureView technologies.[37]
In 2002, Nokia attempted to break into the handheld gaming market with the N-Gage.[38] Nokia's head of entertainment and media, Ilkka Raiskinen, once quoted "Game Boy is for 10-year-olds",[39] stating that N-Gage is more suited to a mature audience. However, the device was a failure, unable to challenge the dominant market leader Nintendo. Nokia attempted to revive N-Gage as a platform for their S60 smartphones, which eventually launched in 2008.[40]
Nokia launched mobile TV trials in 2005 in Finland with content provided by public broadcaster Yle. The services are based on the DVB-H standard. It could be viewed with the widescreen Nokia 7710 smartphone with a special accessory enabling it to receive DVB-H signals.[41] Nokia partnered with Arqiva and O2 to launch trials in the UK in September 2005.[42]
On 1 June 2006 Jorma Ollila became the company's chairman and retired as CEO, being replaced by Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo.[43]
In August 2007 Nokia introduced Ovi, an umbrella name for the company's new internet services which included the N-Gage platform and the Nokia Music Store.[44] The Ovi Store faced stiff competition against Apple's App Store when it was introduced in 2008.[45]
In October 2008 Nokia announced the Nokia 5800 XpressMusic, the first device to ship with the new touch-centric S60 5th Edition, also known as Symbian^1, the first iteration of the platform since the creation of the Symbian Foundation. November 2008 Nokia announced it would end mobile phone sales in Japan because of low market share.[46]
2010–2014[edit]

In April 2010 Nokia introduced its next flagship mobile device, the Nokia N8, which would be the first to run on Symbian^3.[47] However it was delayed for many months which tarnished the company's image,[48] especially after the failure of its previous flagship N97 and tougher competition from Apple and the rising Google. On 10 September 2010, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo was fired as CEO and it was announced that Stephen Elop from Microsoft would take Nokia's CEO position, becoming the first non-Finnish director in Nokia's history. [49]
The old Symbian OS became completely open source in February 2010.[50] However in November 2010 it was announced that the Symbian Foundation was closing and that Nokia would take back control of the Symbian operating system under closed licensing.[51] By now Nokia was the only remaining company using the platform, along with carrier NTT DoCoMo in Japan, after both Samsung and Sony Ericsson moved to Android.
Nokia's Symbian platform that had been the leading smartphone platform in Europe and Asia for many years was quickly becoming outdated and difficult for developers after the advent of iPhone OS and Android. To counter this, Nokia started to develop a Linux-based successor, MeeGo, in 2010. However, in February 2011, they scrapped MeeGo and announce a partnership with Microsoft to use Windows Phone as Nokia's primary operating system, relegating Symbian to a lower priority. Although the MeeGo-based N9 was met with a highly positive reception in 2011, Nokia - apparently pressured by Microsoft[citation needed] - had already decided to end development on MeeGo and solely focus on its Microsoft partnership. After the announcement of the Microsoft deal, Nokia's market share deteriorated; this was due to demand for Symbian dropping when consumers realized Nokia's focus and attention would be elsewhere.[52] Nokia's first Windows Phone flagship was the Lumia 800, which arrived in November 2011. Falling sales in 2011, which were not being improved significantly with the Lumia line in 2012, led to consecutive quarters of huge losses. By mid-2012, with the company's stock price falling below $2, Nokia almost became bankrupt.[53][54]
On 11 March 2011 Nokia announced that it had paid Elop a $6 million signing bonus as "compensation for lost income from his prior employer," on top of his $1.4 million annual salary.[55] This was a turning point, since Elop has previously been a Microsoft employee in its Business Division. It later became clear that Microsoft was influential within Nokia, pushing forward its Windows Phone offering.
When the Lumia 920 was announced in September 2012, it was seen by the press as the first high-end Windows Phone that could challenge rivals due to its advanced feature set. The company was also making gains in developing countries with its Asha series, which were selling strongly.[56] Although Nokia's smartphone market share recovered in 2013, it was still not enough to improve the dire financial situation:[57] the company had already been undergoing huge losses for two years, and in September 2013 announced the sale of its mobile and devices division to Microsoft.[58] The sale was positive for Nokia to stop further disastrous financial figures, as well as for Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer, who wanted Microsoft to produce more hardware and turn it into a devices and services company.[59] The sale was completed in April 2014, with Microsoft Mobile becoming the successor to Nokia's mobile devices division.

In July 2013, Nokia purchased Siemens' stake in the Nokia Siemens Networks joint venture for $2.2 billion, turning it into a wholly owned subsidiary called Nokia Solutions and Networks,[60] until being rebranded as simply Nokia Networks shortly after.[61] During Nokia's financial struggles, its profitable networking division with Siemens provided much of its income; thus, the purchase proved to be positive, particularly after the sale of its mobile devices unit.[62]
2014–present[edit]
After the sale of its mobile devices division, Nokia started to focus on network equipment through Nokia Networks.[63]
In October 2014, Nokia and China Mobile signed a US$970 million framework deal for delivery between 2014 and 2015.[64]
On 17 November 2014, Nokia Technologies head Ramzi Haidamus disclosed that the company planned to re-enter the consumer electronics business as an original design manufacturer, licensing in-house hardware designs and technologies to third-party manufacturers. Haidamus stated that the Nokia brand was "valuable" but "is diminishing in value, and that's why it is important that we reverse that trend very quickly, imminently."[65] The next day, Nokia unveiled the N1, an Android tablet manufactured by Foxconn, as its first product following the Microsoft sale.[66] Haidamus emphasized that devices released under these licensing agreements would be held to high standards in production quality, and would "look and feel just like Nokia built it."[7] Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri stated that the company planned to re-enter the mobile phone business in this manner in 2016, following the expiration of its non-compete clause with Microsoft.[67]
According to Robert Morlino, the spokesman of Nokia Technologies, Nokia planned follow the brand-licensing model rather than direct marketing of mobile devices due to the sale of its mobile devices division to Microsoft.[68] The company took aggressive steps to revitalize itself, evident through its hiring of software experts, testing of new products, and seeking of sales partners.[69] On 14 July 2015, CEO Rajeev Suri confirmed that the company would make a return to the mobile phones market in 2016.[70]
On 28 July 2015, Nokia announced OZO, a 360-degrees virtual reality camera, with eight 2K optical image sensors. The division behind the product, Nokia Technologies, claimed that OZO would be the most advanced VR film-making platform.[71] Nokia's press release stated that OZO would be "the first in a planned portfolio of digital media solutions," with more technologic products expected in the future.[72] OZO was fully unveiled on 30 November in Los Angeles. The OZO, designed for professional use, was intended for retail for US$60,000;[73] however, its price was decreased by $15,000 prior to release,[74] and is listed on its official website as $40,000. [75]




Nokia office building in North America - originally Alcatel-Lucent's office before the acquisition


On 14 April 2015, Nokia confirmed that it was in talks with the French telecommunications equipment company Alcatel-Lucent regarding a potential merger.[76] The next day, Nokia officially announced that it had agreed to purchase Alcatel-Lucent for €15.6 billion in an all-stock deal.[77] CEO Rajeev Suri felt that the purchase would give Nokia a strategic advantage in the development of 5G wireless technologies,[78][79] and the acquisition aimed to create a stronger competitor to the rival firms Ericsson and Huawei, whom Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent had surpassed in terms of total combined revenue in 2014. Nokia shareholders hold 66.5% of the new combined company, while Alcatel-Lucent shareholders hold 33.5%. The Bell Labs division was to be maintained, but the Alcatel-Lucent brand would be replaced by Nokia.[77][80] In October 2015, following approval of the deal by China's Ministry of Commerce, the merger awaited approval by French regulators.[81] Despite the initial intent of selling the submarine cable division separately, Alcatel-Lucent later declared that it would not.[82] The merger closed on 14 January 2016,[83] but wasn't fully completed until 3 November 2016. From the acquisition Nokia is now also the owner of the Alcatel mobile phone brand, which continues to be licensed to TCL Corporation.
On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of BMW, Daimler AG and Volkswagen Group for €2.8 billion.[84] The deal closed on 3 December 2015.[85]
On 26 April 2016, Nokia announced its intent to acquire connected health device maker Withings for US$191 million. The company was integrated into a new Digital Health unit of Nokia Technologies.[86][87]
On 18 May 2016, Microsoft Mobile sold its Nokia-branded feature phone business to HMD Global, a new company founded by former Nokia executive Jean-Francois Baril, and an associated factory in Vietnam to Foxconn's FIH Mobile subsidiary. Nokia subsequently entered into a long-term licensing deal to make HMD the exclusive manufacturer of Nokia-branded phones and tablets outside of Japan, operating in conjunction with Foxconn. The deal also granted HMD the right to essential patents and feature phone software. HMD subsequently announced the Android-based Nokia 6 smartphone in January 2017.[88][89] At Mobile World Congress, HMD additionally unveiled the Nokia 3 and Nokia 5 smartphones, as well as a re-imagining of Nokia's classic 3310 feature phone.[90][91] While Nokia has no investment in the company they do have some input in the new devices.
On 28 June 2016 Nokia demonstrated for the first time ever a 5G-ready network.[92] In February 2017 Nokia carried out a 5G connection in Oulu, Finland using the 5GTF standard, backed by Verizon, on Intel architecture-based equipment.[93]
On 5 July 2017, Nokia and Xiaomi announced that they have signed a business collaboration agreement and a multi-year patent agreement, including a cross license to each company's cellular standard essential patents.[94]
Operations[edit]
Nokia is a public limited-liability company listed on the Helsinki and New York stock exchanges.[4] Nokia has played a very large role in the economy of Finland,[95][96] and it is an important employer in the country, working with multiple local partners and subcontractors.[97] Nokia contributed 1.6% to Finland's GDP and accounted for about 16% of the country's exports in 2006.[98]
Nokia comprises of three business groups.
Nokia Networks[edit]
Nokia Networks, formerly known as Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN) and Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN), is a multinational data networking and telecommunications equipment company headquartered in Espoo, Finland. It is the world's fourth-largest telecoms equipment manufacturer, measured by 2011 revenues (after Ericsson, Huawei and Alcatel-Lucent).[99] It has operations in around 150 countries.[100]
The NSN brand identity was launched at the 3GSM World Congress in Barcelona in February 2007 as a joint venture between Nokia (50.1%) and Siemens (49.9%),[101] although it is now wholly owned by Nokia. It provides wireless and fixed network infrastructure, communications and networks service platforms, and professional services to operators and service providers.[102] It focuses on GSM, EDGE, 3G/W-CDMA, LTE and WiMAX radio access networks, supporting core networks with increasing IP and multiaccess capabilities and services.
In July 2013, Nokia bought back all shares in Nokia Siemens Networks for a sum of US$2.21 billion and renamed it Nokia Networks.[103]
Nokia Technologies[edit]
Nokia Technologies is a division of Nokia that develops and licenses technology and the Nokia brand.[104] Its focuses are imaging, sensing, wireless connectivity, power management and materials, and other areas such as the IP licensing program. It consists of three labs: Radio Systems Lab, in areas of radio access, wireless local connectivity, and radio implementation; Media Technologies Lab, in areas of multimedia and interaction; and Sensor and Material Technologies Lab, in areas of advanced sensing solutions, interaction methods, nanotechnologies and quantum technologies. Nokia Technologies also provides public participation in its development through the Invent with Nokia program.[105]
In November 2014, Nokia Technologies launched its first product, the Nokia N1 Android 5.0 tablet computer manufactured by Foxconn.[106]
In July 2015, Nokia Technologies introduced a VR camera called OZO, designed for professional content creators and developed in Tampere, Finland. With its 8 synchronized shutter sensors and 8 microphones, the product can capture stereoscopic 3D video and spatial audio.[107][108]
Following May 2016, Nokia Technologies' research and development team acts as the base for future Nokia-branded devices created by HMD Global.
On 31 May 2016, the Digital Health unit was founded. It is led by Cédric Hutchings, former CEO of Withings, which Nokia acquired.[109]
On 31 August 2016, Ramzi Haidamus announced he would be stepping down from his position as president of Nokia Technologies.[110] Brad Rodrigues, previously head of strategy and business development, assumed the role of interim president.[111]
Nokia Bell Labs[edit]
Bell Laboratories became a subsidiary of Nokia Corporation after the takeover of Alcatel-Lucent. It was subsequently renamed Nokia Bell Labs.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Corporate governance[edit]
The control and management of Nokia is divided among the shareholders at a general meeting and the Nokia Leadership Team (left),[112] under the direction of the board of directors (right).[113] The chairman and the rest of the Nokia Leadership Team members are appointed by the board of directors. Only the Chairman of the Nokia Leadership Team can belong to both the board of directors and the Nokia Leadership Team. The board of directors' committees consist of the Audit Committee,[114] the Personnel Committee,[115] and the Corporate Governance and Nomination Committee.[116][117]

Stock[edit]
Nokia is a public limited liability company and is the oldest company listed under the same name on the Helsinki Stock Exchange, beginning in 1915.[121] Nokia has had a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange since 1994.[4][121] Nokia shares were delisted from the London Stock Exchange in 2003, the Paris Stock Exchange in 2004, the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 2007 and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in 2012.[122] Due to the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent in 2015, Nokia listed its shares again on the Paris Stock Exchange and was included in the CAC 40 index on 6 January 2016.[123]
In 2007, Nokia had a market capitalization of €110 billion; by 17 July 2012 this had fallen to €6.28 billion, and by 23 February 2015, it increased to €26.07 billion.
Corporate culture[edit]
Nokia's official corporate culture manifesto, The Nokia Way, emphasizes the speed and flexibility of decision-making in a flat, networked organization.[124]
The official business language of Nokia is English. All documentation is written in English, and is used in official intra-company communication.
In May 2007, Nokia redefined its values after initiating a series of discussion across its worldwide branches regarding what the new values of the company should be. Based on the employee suggestions, the new values were defined as: Engaging You, Achieving Together, Passion for Innovation, and Very Human.[124]
In August 2014, Nokia redefined its values again after the sale of its Devices business. The new values were defined with the key words respect, achievement, renewal and challenge.
Headquarters[edit]




The Nokia House (now Microsoft Talo) was Nokia's head office up until April 2014. The building is located by the Gulf of Finland in Keilaniemi, Espoo, and was constructed between 1995 and 1997. It was the workplace of more than 1,000 Nokia employees.[121]


The Nokia House was the head office building of Nokia Corporation, located in Keilaniemi, Espoo. The two southernmost parts of the building were built in the early 1990s and the third, northernmost part was built in 2000. Around 5000 employees work in the premises.
In December 2012, Nokia announced that it had sold its head office building to Finland-based Exilion for €170 million and was leasing it back on a long term basis.[125] The building was later sold to Microsoft as part of the sale of the mobile phone business in April 2014 and renamed to Microsoft Talo.[126]
Since the sale, Nokia's headquarters are in Karaportti, Espoo, Finland.[127]

Controversies[edit]
NSN's provision of intercept capability to Iran[edit]
In 2008, Nokia Siemens Networks, a joint venture between Nokia and Siemens AG, reportedly provided Iran's monopoly telecom company with technology that allowed it to intercept the Internet communications of its citizens.[133] The technology reportedly allowed Iran to use deep packet inspection to read and change the content of emails, social media, and online phone calls. The technology "enables authorities to not only block communication but to monitor it to gather information about individuals, as well as alter it for disinformation purposes."[134]
During the post-election protests in Iran in June 2009, Iran's Internet access was reported to have slowed to less than a tenth of its normal speeds, which experts suspected was due to the use of the interception technology.[135]
In July 2009, Nokia began to experience a boycott of their products and services in Iran. The boycott was led by consumers sympathetic to the post-election protest movement and targeted companies deemed to be collaborating with the regime. Demand for handsets fell and users began shunning SMS messaging.[136]
Nokia Siemens Networks asserted in a press release that it provided Iran only with a "lawful intercept capability solely for monitoring of local voice calls" and that it "has not provided any deep packet inspection, web censorship, or Internet filtering capability to Iran."[137]
Lex Nokia[edit]
In 2009, Nokia heavily supported a law in Finland that allows companies to monitor their employees' electronic communications in cases of suspected information leaking.[138] Nokia denied rumors that the company had considered moving its head office out of Finland if laws on electronic surveillance were not changed.[139] The Finnish media dubbed the law Lex Nokia because it was implemented as a result of Nokia's pressure.
The law was enacted, but with strict requirements for implementation of its provisions. No company had used its provisions prior to 25 February 2013, when the Office of Data Protection Ombudsman confirmed that city of Hämeenlinna had recently given the required notice.[140]
Nokia–Apple patent dispute[edit]
In October 2009, Nokia filed a lawsuit against Apple Inc. in the U.S. District Court of Delaware claiming that Apple infringed on 10 of its patents related to wireless communication including data transfer.[141] Apple was quick to respond with a countersuit filed in December 2009 accusing Nokia of 11 patent infringements. Apple's General Counsel, Bruce Sewell went a step further by stating, "Other companies must compete with us by inventing their own technologies, not just by stealing ours." This resulted in a legal battle between the two telecom majors with Nokia filing another suit, this time with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), alleging Apple of infringing its patents in "virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players and computers."[142] Nokia went on to ask the court to ban all U.S. imports of the Apple products, including the iPhone, Macintosh, and iPod. Apple countersued by filing a complaint with the ITC in January 2010.[141]
In June 2011, Apple settled with Nokia and agreed to an estimated one time payment of $600 million and royalties to Nokia.[143] The two companies also agreed on a cross-licensing patents for some of their patented technologies.[144][145]
Alleged tax evasion in India[edit]
Nokia's Indian subsidiary has been charged with non-payment of TDS and transgressing transfer pricing norms in India.[146] The unpaid TDS of ₹30 billion, accrued during a course of six years, was due to royalty paid by the Indian subsidiary to its parent company.[147]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
