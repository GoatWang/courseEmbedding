AETOS CAPITAL
Absolute return investing involves substantial risks, including the risk of loss of invested capital.�Absolute return investments are typically made through investments in illiquid,
unregulated investment funds that employ sophisticated investment techniques, often involving derivatives and leverage, in a wide range of financial instruments and markets.
These investments entail a wide variety of risks, which remain substantial notwithstanding the risk management practices we employ in selecting and monitoring the funds in
which we invest.�Potential investors in absolute return vehicles are urged to familiarize themselves with these risks before investing.

Investment Performance:  

����Performance figures shown are net of investment advisory and performance fees of 1.00% of assets
annually and 10% of profits above the three month Treasury bill return.��The returns also reflect Fund level expenses, some of which have been waived and/or reimbursed by the Investment Advisor.��Returns would have been lower without
such waivers and reimbursements.��Past performance is not indicative of future returns.�� 

����Absolute return investing involves substantial risks, including the risk of loss of invested capital.�
Absolute return investments are typically made through investments in illiquid, unregulated investment funds that employ sophisticated investment techniques, often involving derivatives and leverage, in a wide range of financial instruments and markets.��These
investments entail a wide variety of risks, which remain substantial notwithstanding the risk management practices we employ in�selecting and monitoring funds we invest in.� 

����Prospective investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, and the charges and expenses discussed
above carefully before investing.��The prospectus contains this and other information; a free copy of the prospectus may be obtained by calling 212-201-2540.��Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
