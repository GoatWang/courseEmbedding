This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Allied Motion names new CFO
Allied Motion Technologies Inc. has hired Robert P. Maida to become the chief financial officer effective Dec. 1, to replace Richard D. Smith who will retire on March 31, 2013.

Smith currently serves as the executive chairman of the board of directors and the chief financial officer and will work with Maida until his retirement to provide a smooth transition of the CFO’s responsibilities. After his retirement, Smith will continue to serve as a board member.
“Rob combines strong international finance, motion industry and extensive training/experience of lean tools and principles, all of which will contribute to the accomplishment of the strategic goals and objectives of our company,” said Dick Warzala, president and CEO. “Rob will be a key member of our Operational Excellence Team as we expand and implement Allied Systematic Tools (AST) in all areas of our business. His past leadership experience in implementing ERP systems will also help ensure a successful installation of the Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP System, currently being implemented throughout the Company.”
Prior to joining Allied, Maida worked for over two years as the director of finance for Avox Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Zodiac Aerospace. Prior to that, he worked for API Motion/Danaher Motion, where he progressed to the position of director of finance for the Applied Products Group of Danaher Motion, a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation.
