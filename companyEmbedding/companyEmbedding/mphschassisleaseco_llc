The E-Z Chassis Swaps Story

My Truck Life Background:
I was raised as a "Poor Farm Kid" on a small farm in western Minnesota.
My Dad had a talent to make almost anything from scrap pieces. I guess I inherited some of that as well.

The first vehicle I drove was our 1949 Chevy 3/4 ton pickup when I was 12 years old.
I took a liking to the "49er", as we called it. I convinced my Mom to buy a quart of Dutch-Boy
"Delft Blue" enamel so I could give the faded and beat-up pickup a new look.
Of course a quart didn't cover the whole pickup, so I found some old dark blue paint to do the top.
(I told you we were poor!) One coat of carefully brush-applied enamel goes along way!
The pickup had an overhauled '57 235 6-banger that ran like a top. At 50 MPH, it was wound tight!

Career Background:

 I always was a "car nut", so in my teen years I worked at a gas station and a body shop.
It was my dream to go to trade school for Auto Body and build "Street Machines". (It was a 70's term)
I ended up going for Drafting and Machine Design, but took Auto Body as a night course.
I got my first career job while attending school. I started out as a Draftsman, then Tool Draftsman,
then Tool Designer, then Production Engineer Assistant and then Mechanical Design Engineer.
  And after 25 years of dedication,... I was permanently laid off due to company "down-sizing".

Birth of E-Z Chassis Swaps, LLC:
I took advantage of the severance period to design and develop a kit for '47-'53 pickups.
I got the "brainstorm" four years prior to this when we were mounting my buddy's '54 Chevy on a
short-wheel base S-10 chassis. I found out just how "snakey" those frames are and it was no easy
task to make simple mounts to adapt the old body. I figured I could save people a lot of time (and frustration!) if I could develop a handy kit that also adapted as much of the S-10 components as possible. This would also save time & money because you're using other parts from your "donor" S-10.

Goals of the Business:
1) To provide customer satisfaction of our handy chassis mounting kits for the "do-it-yourselfer". 
2) To constantly expand & improve our product line to meet the needs of our customers. 
3) By using local, small manufacturing shops, we add to the local economy. Built in the USA!!

Personal:
On the Homepage I have the verse from Proverbs 16:3 "Commit your work onto the Lord, and it will succeed."  I am convinced that God has encouraged me to take a huge step of faith and start
this company. Without His encouragement, I would have given up many times by now.
 
I received God's gift of Forgiveness, Peace, and Eternal life back in July of 1980.
 It radically changed my life. I'm not perfect, but my Jesus is.

Another passion of mine is short-term mission's trips. Go if you can. It will change your life!
10% of the profits from selling my products goes to help feed children and orphans in Honduras.

God Bless You!

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
