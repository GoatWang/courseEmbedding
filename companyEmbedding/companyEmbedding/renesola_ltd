Is it a good thing LEDs don't emit UV radiation?


by
ReneSola America 


 Posted on 2017-06-07 13:46:51
        







While the advantages of LED Lighting always
refer to massive savings in power consumption, reduced heat, and lamp
longevity, it’s also important to mention the advantage that LEDs emit
practically no ultraviolet light. While other lighting technologies always emit
some ultraviolet radiation, because of the precisely and scientifically
controlled manufacturing of LED lights there is no wasted energy emitted that is
potentially harmful and unpleasant to the eye. This is also crucially important
in photo-sensitive environments such as areas with artworks that can be damaged
from UV exposure, or supermarkets where UV can degrade perishable food.

What is the DLC and why does it matter


by
ReneSola America


 Posted on 2017-04-18 10:07:36
        






          The
Design Lights Consortium® Qualified Products List, or DLC QPL, is a
qualification program created and administered by the nonprofit Northeast
Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP), whereby approved lights must pass
certain energy efficacy criteria in addition to color, thermal and total flux
requirements. For instance, the measured lumens per watt (efficacy) must be at
a certain ratio. While the DLC was launched nearly 20 years ago, the DLC QPL
began in 2008 and took off in 2009. By creating assurances for energy efficient
standards for general lighting, the DLC QPL has been adopted by more than 80
energy efficiency programs through electrical utilities in North America.

Why do we use unshunted tombstones with Internal Drive T8s


by
ReneSola America


 Posted on 2017-03-08 13:36:22
        







If you’ve purchased our internal drive line
voltage powered T8 tubes in the past, you know that we ship them with a pair of
unshunted tombstones. But why can’t the tubes use the tombstones already
installed with the fluorescent ballasts? More likely than not, those tombstones
already in the troffers and fixtures are shunted.
The difference between a shunted and non-shunted/unshunted tombstone is that
the metal contact inside the shunted socket is one solid piece, giving it continuity if
measured. Unshunted tombstones, on the other hand, have separate contacts for
each pin, and were developed much later as fluorescent ballast technology
advanced.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Leveraging its global presence and expansive distribution and sales network, ReneSola is well positioned to provide its highest quality green energy products and on-time services for EPC, installers, and green energy projects around the world. For more information, please visit www.renesola.com.About China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd.China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd. ("CR" or "China Resources Group") is a diversified holding company registered in Hong Kong. CR was first established as "Liow & Co." in Hong Kong in 1938, and was later restructured and renamed as China Resources Company in 1948. In 1952, instead of being affiliated to the General Office of the CPC Central Committee, it came under the Central Trade Department (now known as the Ministry of Commerce). In 1983, it was again restructured into China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd. In December 1999, CR was no longer linked to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, and came under state management. In 2003, under the direct supervision of SASAC, it became one of the key state-owned enterprises.  China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd's main business focus is the export of mainland Chinese products (including energy) to Hong Kong. Its retail operations are organised under the China Resources Retail group, and include Chinese Arts & Crafts; it also runs a number of supermarkets in Hong Kong, originally under the CRC name, but now rebranded as Vanguard. It also owns Ng Fung Hong, the monopoly meat importer into Hong Kong.  For more information, please visit China Resources (Holding) Co. Ltd.'s website at http://en.crc.com.cn/.Safe Harbor StatementThis press release contains statements that constitute "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Whenever you read a statement that is not simply a statement of historical fact (such as when the Company describes what it "believes," "plans," "expects" or "anticipates" will occur, what "will" or "could" happen, and other similar statements), you must remember that the Company's expectations may not be correct, even though it believes that they are reasonable. The Company does not guarantee that the forward-looking statements will happen as described or that they will happen at all. Further information regarding risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is included in the Company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's annual report on Form 20-F. The Company undertakes no obligation, beyond that required by law, to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made, even though the Company's situation may change in the future.Read MoreFor investor and media inquiries for ReneSola, please contact:In China:ReneSola LtdMs. Rebecca Shen +86 (21) 6280-9180 x106 ir@renesola.com The Blueshirt Group AsiaMr. Gary Dvorchak, CFA +86 (138) 1079-1480 gary@blueshirtgroup.com In the United States:The Blueshirt GroupMr. Ralph Fong +1 (415) 489-2195 ralph@blueshirtgroup.comTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/renesola-announces-strategic-partnership-with-china-resources-leasing-co-ltd-300395429.htmlReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHypothetically speaking, U.S. Admiral says ready for nuclear strike on China if Trump so orderedReutersEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredNorth Korea Missiles Strike Fear in U.K. and Australia, Two U.S. AlliesNewsweekChelsea backlash a lesson for clubs chasing China cashAFP‘If Trump Asked, We’d Nuke China Next Week,’ Says U.S. Navy Fleet CommanderNewsweekZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredSouth China Sea: Vietnam And India Should Follow Duterte's WisdomForbesConsumers, businesses lift U.S. economic growth in second quarterReutersTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoInvestors yawn as US economic growth rebounds in the second quarter; Amazon fallsYahoo FinanceA Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredRepublicans warn Trump: No confirmation hearing for a Sessions replacement, and no recess appointment eitherBusiness InsiderExxon profit nearly doubles, but falls short of expectationsReutersRussia orders cut in US diplomats in reaction to sanctionsDirk: Gosh, I hope this doesn't lead Russia to deny America of all the Russian cars, Russian electronics, Russian textiles and all other Russian products that we consume.

Is it a good thing LEDs don't emit UV radiation?


by
ReneSola America 


 Posted on 2017-06-07 13:46:51
        







While the advantages of LED Lighting always
refer to massive savings in power consumption, reduced heat, and lamp
longevity, it’s also important to mention the advantage that LEDs emit
practically no ultraviolet light. While other lighting technologies always emit
some ultraviolet radiation, because of the precisely and scientifically
controlled manufacturing of LED lights there is no wasted energy emitted that is
potentially harmful and unpleasant to the eye. This is also crucially important
in photo-sensitive environments such as areas with artworks that can be damaged
from UV exposure, or supermarkets where UV can degrade perishable food.

What is the DLC and why does it matter


by
ReneSola America


 Posted on 2017-04-18 10:07:36
        






          The
Design Lights Consortium® Qualified Products List, or DLC QPL, is a
qualification program created and administered by the nonprofit Northeast
Energy Efficiency Partnerships (NEEP), whereby approved lights must pass
certain energy efficacy criteria in addition to color, thermal and total flux
requirements. For instance, the measured lumens per watt (efficacy) must be at
a certain ratio. While the DLC was launched nearly 20 years ago, the DLC QPL
began in 2008 and took off in 2009. By creating assurances for energy efficient
standards for general lighting, the DLC QPL has been adopted by more than 80
energy efficiency programs through electrical utilities in North America.

Why do we use unshunted tombstones with Internal Drive T8s


by
ReneSola America


 Posted on 2017-03-08 13:36:22
        







If you’ve purchased our internal drive line
voltage powered T8 tubes in the past, you know that we ship them with a pair of
unshunted tombstones. But why can’t the tubes use the tombstones already
installed with the fluorescent ballasts? More likely than not, those tombstones
already in the troffers and fixtures are shunted.
The difference between a shunted and non-shunted/unshunted tombstone is that
the metal contact inside the shunted socket is one solid piece, giving it continuity if
measured. Unshunted tombstones, on the other hand, have separate contacts for
each pin, and were developed much later as fluorescent ballast technology
advanced.
