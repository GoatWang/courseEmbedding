Exclusive BARTH-HAAS hop varieties
Looking for something really special? Then look no further than the BARTH-HAAS GROUP. MONROE and RELAX are two exclusive hop varieties that you will not find anywhere else.





Monroe
With an alpha value of only 2.5% and an oil content of 0.95 ml/100 g, the Monroe at first seems rather gentle and mild. But when you let this variety loose on a beer, it turns into a knockout in red (aromas).

Relax
Relax is a variety that was originally used for tea rather than beer. Relax has a very low alpha acid content and a high oil content. With such a high oil content, a wide diversity of aromas is to be expected.

Hop breeding
Hop breeding has been carried out in Europe since the beginning of the 20th century. The initial incentive was the increased occurrence of fungal diseases, which led not only to fears amongst hop growers for their crops but also amongst brewers for their raw material supplies.
Although this is now more than 100 years ago, hop breeding has lost none of its relevance for the present – in fact, quite the contrary. Resistance to diseases and pests is only one goal of hop breeding today. Increasing the yield and brewing quality play an equally important role. In relation to the latter in particular, it is the compounds i.e. the proportion of different hop oils, which are attracting increasing attention. And not just since the advent of Flavour Hops.
In view of these developments, it goes without saying that the BARTH-HAAS GROUP provides active support to hop breeding around the world – whether by sponsoring government breeding facilities or through its own breeding programmes.

                                        As Adient’s lead director, Mr. Barth brings extensive business and leadership experience to the board, along with the many global relationships he’s cultivated in the automotive industry over his long and successful career. 

Mr. Barth served as CEO of Johnson Controls from 2002 until his retirement in 2007 and as chairman of the board from 2004 to 2007. Under Mr. Barth’s direction, Johnson Controls solidified its standing as an industry frontrunner and continued to grow during his tenure. 

From 1998 to 2002, he worked as the company’s chief operating officer and, prior to that, held the title of vice president and general manager of the Plastics Technology Group and the Automotive Systems Group in 1990. He originally joined Johnson Controls in 1969. 

Mr. Barth is a member of Business Roundtable and the Greater Milwaukee Committee and is a director of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.

History[edit]




A Johnson Super-Sensitive Thermometer on an air conditioning unit


In 1883, Warren S. Johnson, a professor at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin, received a patent for the first electric room thermostat. His invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company. Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. After Johnson's death in 1911, the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974.
On November 21, 2005, Johnson Controls Inc. said it must restate financial results for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. The changes would have no impact on net income, earnings per share or the financial position as previously reported.[7] During the 2008-2009 recession, the company president Keith Wandell lobbied Congress for a bailout of the companies Johnson supplied.[8] The Johnson Controls plant in Lakeshore, Ontario closed in late March 2010 and the property was sold.[9] In 2013, Stephen Roell retired and Alex Molinaroli took his position as CEO and chairman of the board.[10]
On October 31, 2016, the former Johnson Controls Automotive Experience division was spun off as a separate, publicly traded company, Adient plc, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] In March 2017, it was announced that Scott Safety, its safety gear business, would be bought by 3M for $2 billion.[12]

Merger with Tyco[edit]
In January 2016, Johnson Controls merged with Tyco International to create a company headquartered in Cork, Ireland.[13] The new company is called Johnson Controls International Plc.[14]
Hillary Clinton condemned the company for wanting to escape U.S. taxes through the merger after having "begged" the government for financial help in 2008.[15] The Johnson deal, termed "outrageous"[16] by Fortune magazine, qualifies as a "super inversion" because Tyco shareholders will own 44% of the company, thus avoiding penalties that the United States Department of the Treasury has imposed on other inversion deals.[citation needed]
The firm estimated it would save about one hundred and fifty million dollars in a year by avoiding American taxes..[17]
Women's work rights[edit]
In 1982, Johnson Controls enacted what it called a "fetal protection policy", which denied women the right to work on the battery production line because of the potential harm to a fetus they might conceive. Women were allowed to work on the production line only if they could prove that "...their inability to bear children had been medically documented." In April 1984, the United Auto Workers sued Johnson Controls on behalf of three employees. These employees were Mary Craig, who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job, Elsie Nason, a 50-year-old divorcee, who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead, and Donald Penney, who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 10, 1990 and was decided on March 20, 1991. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that "...it is no more important for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role."[18]
Business units[edit]
The company’s operations are segmented into four business units: Building Efficiency, Global WorkPlace Solutions, Power Solutions and Automotive Experience.
Building Efficiency[edit]
The Building Efficiency business unit designs, produces, installs and services heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, industrial refrigeration, building management systems, fire and security systems and mechanical equipment for commercial and residential buildings. The brands produced under this business unit are York, TempMaster, Metasys, Panoptix, Frick and Sabroe.[19] This unit also works with organizations to reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of their buildings.[19][20] This includes retrofitting existing buildings such as the Empire State Building[21] and working on maximizing efficiency in new construction such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[22] Building Efficiency is the company’s longest-running business unit, dating to 1885 when Johnson founded the Johnson Electric Service Company[23] after patenting the electric thermostat in 1883.[24] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 700 branch offices in more than 150 countries.[19]
Johnson Controls was one of the defendants in a multimillion-dollar federal court lawsuit in San Juan, Puerto Rico in a case where 98 people perished and 140 were injured in a fire at the DuPont Plaza Hotel and its casino on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1986. The plaintiffs claimed that Johnson Controls sold and installed an energy management system that failed to give early warning of the fire.[25] After nine months of trial, the company and its energy management system were absolved of blame when the court issued a directed verdict.[26][27] When this trial was completed the plaintiffs had accumulated approximately $220,908,549.00 in damages as a result of various settlements and a jury verdict against some other defendants.[28]
Global WorkPlace Solutions[edit]
The Global WorkPlace Solutions business unit provides outsourced facilities management services globally.[29] It also manages corporate real estate on behalf of its customers including acquiring and disposing of property, administering leases, and managing building related projects such as equipment replacements.[30] On September 23, 2015, CBRE, Inc. purchased the Global Workplace Solutions business unit, retaining the name "Global Workplace Solutions".[31]
Power Solutions[edit]
The Power Solutions business unit designs and manufactures automotive batteries for passenger cars, heavy and light duty trucks, utility vehicles, motorcycles, golf carts and boats.[19][32][33][34][35] It supplies more than one third of the world’s lead-acid batteries[36] to automakers and aftermarket retailers including Wal-Mart, Sears and BMW.[37][38][39] Lead acid battery brands produced under this business unit include OPTIMA, Heliar, LTH, and VARTA automotive batteries.[19] This part of the company also manufactures Lithium-ion cells and complete battery systems to power hybrid and electric vehicles such as the Ford Fusion[40] and Daimler’s S-Class 400.[41] Additionally, it manufactures Absorbent Glass Matt (AGM) and Enhanced Flooded Batteries (EFB) batteries to power Start-Stop vehicles such as the Chevy Malibu and Ford Fusion.[19][36][42][43][44][45][46][47] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 60 locations worldwide.[19]
Automotive Experience[edit]
The Automotive Experience business unit supplies automotive seating, interiors and electronics to automakers.[19][36] It is one of the largest suppliers of car interiors in the world.[48] The seating division designs and manufactures automotive seats and supplies them on a just-in-time schedule. It also designs and manufactures seating components, including mechanisms, tracks, structures foams, fabrics and trim, making Johnson Controls the largest automotive seat supplier in the world.[49] A separate interiors division produces overhead systems, headliners, door panels, instrument panels, and overhead and floor consoles for automotive interiors.[19] Additionally, an electronics division designs and manufactures analog and digital instrument clusters, infotainment systems and hands free electronics.[19][50] Brands produced under this business unit include RECARO automotive seats and Keiper.[48] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 240 locations worldwide.[19] On January 12, 2016 Johnson Controls announced that its remaining Automotive Experience holdings will spin-off and become Adient. This will be finalized on October 1, 2016, and begin to be publicly traded on the NYSE as ticker symbol ADNT on October 3, 2016.[51]
Joint ventures[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions (JCS) was a joint venture between Johnson Controls and French battery company Saft Groupe S.A..[52] It was officially launched in January 2006.[53]
Varta established a JCS development centre at its German HQ, following the setting-up of Varta-SAFT joint venture.[53]
Johnson Controls is exhibiting a plug-in hybrid concept called the re3. Johnson Controls produced cells for lithium-ion hybrid vehicle batteries in France under the joint venture with Saft. Battery assemblies were developed and produced in Hannover(Germany) and Milwaukee(USA)[54]
Despite some signs of promise, Johnson Controls was increasingly dissatisfied with the restrictions of the agreement and also sought a more important ally.[55][56] In May 2011, the American company requested the dissolution of Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions LLC to the Delaware Court of Chancery.[55][56] The two companies agreed to the separation and Johnson Controls paid Saft 145 million dollars for its shares in the joint venture as well as for the right to use certain technology developed by it. Johnson Controls retained the Michigan facility built by the partnership. The French joint facility was transferred to Saft.[57][58][59]

Building Efficiency[edit]
The Building Efficiency business unit designs, produces, installs and services heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, industrial refrigeration, building management systems, fire and security systems and mechanical equipment for commercial and residential buildings. The brands produced under this business unit are York, TempMaster, Metasys, Panoptix, Frick and Sabroe.[19] This unit also works with organizations to reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of their buildings.[19][20] This includes retrofitting existing buildings such as the Empire State Building[21] and working on maximizing efficiency in new construction such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[22] Building Efficiency is the company’s longest-running business unit, dating to 1885 when Johnson founded the Johnson Electric Service Company[23] after patenting the electric thermostat in 1883.[24] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 700 branch offices in more than 150 countries.[19]

History[edit]




A Johnson Super-Sensitive Thermometer on an air conditioning unit


In 1883, Warren S. Johnson, a professor at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin, received a patent for the first electric room thermostat. His invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company. Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. After Johnson's death in 1911, the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974.
On November 21, 2005, Johnson Controls Inc. said it must restate financial results for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. The changes would have no impact on net income, earnings per share or the financial position as previously reported.[7] During the 2008-2009 recession, the company president Keith Wandell lobbied Congress for a bailout of the companies Johnson supplied.[8] The Johnson Controls plant in Lakeshore, Ontario closed in late March 2010 and the property was sold.[9] In 2013, Stephen Roell retired and Alex Molinaroli took his position as CEO and chairman of the board.[10]
On October 31, 2016, the former Johnson Controls Automotive Experience division was spun off as a separate, publicly traded company, Adient plc, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] In March 2017, it was announced that Scott Safety, its safety gear business, would be bought by 3M for $2 billion.[12]

Merger with Tyco[edit]
In January 2016, Johnson Controls merged with Tyco International to create a company headquartered in Cork, Ireland.[13] The new company is called Johnson Controls International Plc.[14]
Hillary Clinton condemned the company for wanting to escape U.S. taxes through the merger after having "begged" the government for financial help in 2008.[15] The Johnson deal, termed "outrageous"[16] by Fortune magazine, qualifies as a "super inversion" because Tyco shareholders will own 44% of the company, thus avoiding penalties that the United States Department of the Treasury has imposed on other inversion deals.[citation needed]
The firm estimated it would save about one hundred and fifty million dollars in a year by avoiding American taxes..[17]
Women's work rights[edit]
In 1982, Johnson Controls enacted what it called a "fetal protection policy", which denied women the right to work on the battery production line because of the potential harm to a fetus they might conceive. Women were allowed to work on the production line only if they could prove that "...their inability to bear children had been medically documented." In April 1984, the United Auto Workers sued Johnson Controls on behalf of three employees. These employees were Mary Craig, who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job, Elsie Nason, a 50-year-old divorcee, who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead, and Donald Penney, who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 10, 1990 and was decided on March 20, 1991. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that "...it is no more important for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role."[18]
Business units[edit]
The company’s operations are segmented into four business units: Building Efficiency, Global WorkPlace Solutions, Power Solutions and Automotive Experience.
Building Efficiency[edit]
The Building Efficiency business unit designs, produces, installs and services heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, industrial refrigeration, building management systems, fire and security systems and mechanical equipment for commercial and residential buildings. The brands produced under this business unit are York, TempMaster, Metasys, Panoptix, Frick and Sabroe.[19] This unit also works with organizations to reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of their buildings.[19][20] This includes retrofitting existing buildings such as the Empire State Building[21] and working on maximizing efficiency in new construction such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[22] Building Efficiency is the company’s longest-running business unit, dating to 1885 when Johnson founded the Johnson Electric Service Company[23] after patenting the electric thermostat in 1883.[24] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 700 branch offices in more than 150 countries.[19]
Johnson Controls was one of the defendants in a multimillion-dollar federal court lawsuit in San Juan, Puerto Rico in a case where 98 people perished and 140 were injured in a fire at the DuPont Plaza Hotel and its casino on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1986. The plaintiffs claimed that Johnson Controls sold and installed an energy management system that failed to give early warning of the fire.[25] After nine months of trial, the company and its energy management system were absolved of blame when the court issued a directed verdict.[26][27] When this trial was completed the plaintiffs had accumulated approximately $220,908,549.00 in damages as a result of various settlements and a jury verdict against some other defendants.[28]

It also designs and manufactures seating components, including mechanisms, tracks, structures foams, fabrics and trim, making Johnson Controls the largest automotive seat supplier in the world.[49] A separate interiors division produces overhead systems, headliners, door panels, instrument panels, and overhead and floor consoles for automotive interiors.[19] Additionally, an electronics division designs and manufactures analog and digital instrument clusters, infotainment systems and hands free electronics.[19][50] Brands produced under this business unit include RECARO automotive seats and Keiper.[48] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 240 locations worldwide.[19] On January 12, 2016 Johnson Controls announced that its remaining Automotive Experience holdings will spin-off and become Adient.

Johnson Controls International Plc is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Cork, Ireland[2] that produces automotive parts such as batteries and electronics and HVAC equipment for buildings. It employs 170,000 people in more than 1,300 locations across six continents. As of 2016[update] it was listed 242nd in the Fortune Global 500[3]; in 2017 it became ineligible for the Fortune 500, as it was headquartered outside the U.S.[4]

History[edit]




A Johnson Super-Sensitive Thermometer on an air conditioning unit


In 1883, Warren S. Johnson, a professor at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin, received a patent for the first electric room thermostat. His invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company. Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. After Johnson's death in 1911, the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974.
On November 21, 2005, Johnson Controls Inc. said it must restate financial results for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. The changes would have no impact on net income, earnings per share or the financial position as previously reported.[7] During the 2008-2009 recession, the company president Keith Wandell lobbied Congress for a bailout of the companies Johnson supplied.[8] The Johnson Controls plant in Lakeshore, Ontario closed in late March 2010 and the property was sold.[9] In 2013, Stephen Roell retired and Alex Molinaroli took his position as CEO and chairman of the board.[10]
On October 31, 2016, the former Johnson Controls Automotive Experience division was spun off as a separate, publicly traded company, Adient plc, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] In March 2017, it was announced that Scott Safety, its safety gear business, would be bought by 3M for $2 billion.[12]

Merger with Tyco[edit]
In January 2016, Johnson Controls merged with Tyco International to create a company headquartered in Cork, Ireland.[13] The new company is called Johnson Controls International Plc.[14]
Hillary Clinton condemned the company for wanting to escape U.S. taxes through the merger after having "begged" the government for financial help in 2008.[15] The Johnson deal, termed "outrageous"[16] by Fortune magazine, qualifies as a "super inversion" because Tyco shareholders will own 44% of the company, thus avoiding penalties that the United States Department of the Treasury has imposed on other inversion deals.[citation needed]
The firm estimated it would save about one hundred and fifty million dollars in a year by avoiding American taxes..[17]
Women's work rights[edit]
In 1982, Johnson Controls enacted what it called a "fetal protection policy", which denied women the right to work on the battery production line because of the potential harm to a fetus they might conceive. Women were allowed to work on the production line only if they could prove that "...their inability to bear children had been medically documented." In April 1984, the United Auto Workers sued Johnson Controls on behalf of three employees. These employees were Mary Craig, who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job, Elsie Nason, a 50-year-old divorcee, who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead, and Donald Penney, who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 10, 1990 and was decided on March 20, 1991. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that "...it is no more important for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role."[18]
Business units[edit]
The company’s operations are segmented into four business units: Building Efficiency, Global WorkPlace Solutions, Power Solutions and Automotive Experience.
Building Efficiency[edit]
The Building Efficiency business unit designs, produces, installs and services heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, industrial refrigeration, building management systems, fire and security systems and mechanical equipment for commercial and residential buildings. The brands produced under this business unit are York, TempMaster, Metasys, Panoptix, Frick and Sabroe.[19] This unit also works with organizations to reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of their buildings.[19][20] This includes retrofitting existing buildings such as the Empire State Building[21] and working on maximizing efficiency in new construction such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[22] Building Efficiency is the company’s longest-running business unit, dating to 1885 when Johnson founded the Johnson Electric Service Company[23] after patenting the electric thermostat in 1883.[24] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 700 branch offices in more than 150 countries.[19]
Johnson Controls was one of the defendants in a multimillion-dollar federal court lawsuit in San Juan, Puerto Rico in a case where 98 people perished and 140 were injured in a fire at the DuPont Plaza Hotel and its casino on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1986. The plaintiffs claimed that Johnson Controls sold and installed an energy management system that failed to give early warning of the fire.[25] After nine months of trial, the company and its energy management system were absolved of blame when the court issued a directed verdict.[26][27] When this trial was completed the plaintiffs had accumulated approximately $220,908,549.00 in damages as a result of various settlements and a jury verdict against some other defendants.[28]
Global WorkPlace Solutions[edit]
The Global WorkPlace Solutions business unit provides outsourced facilities management services globally.[29] It also manages corporate real estate on behalf of its customers including acquiring and disposing of property, administering leases, and managing building related projects such as equipment replacements.[30] On September 23, 2015, CBRE, Inc. purchased the Global Workplace Solutions business unit, retaining the name "Global Workplace Solutions".[31]
Power Solutions[edit]
The Power Solutions business unit designs and manufactures automotive batteries for passenger cars, heavy and light duty trucks, utility vehicles, motorcycles, golf carts and boats.[19][32][33][34][35] It supplies more than one third of the world’s lead-acid batteries[36] to automakers and aftermarket retailers including Wal-Mart, Sears and BMW.[37][38][39] Lead acid battery brands produced under this business unit include OPTIMA, Heliar, LTH, and VARTA automotive batteries.[19] This part of the company also manufactures Lithium-ion cells and complete battery systems to power hybrid and electric vehicles such as the Ford Fusion[40] and Daimler’s S-Class 400.[41] Additionally, it manufactures Absorbent Glass Matt (AGM) and Enhanced Flooded Batteries (EFB) batteries to power Start-Stop vehicles such as the Chevy Malibu and Ford Fusion.[19][36][42][43][44][45][46][47] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 60 locations worldwide.[19]
Automotive Experience[edit]
The Automotive Experience business unit supplies automotive seating, interiors and electronics to automakers.[19][36] It is one of the largest suppliers of car interiors in the world.[48] The seating division designs and manufactures automotive seats and supplies them on a just-in-time schedule. It also designs and manufactures seating components, including mechanisms, tracks, structures foams, fabrics and trim, making Johnson Controls the largest automotive seat supplier in the world.[49] A separate interiors division produces overhead systems, headliners, door panels, instrument panels, and overhead and floor consoles for automotive interiors.[19] Additionally, an electronics division designs and manufactures analog and digital instrument clusters, infotainment systems and hands free electronics.[19][50] Brands produced under this business unit include RECARO automotive seats and Keiper.[48] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 240 locations worldwide.[19] On January 12, 2016 Johnson Controls announced that its remaining Automotive Experience holdings will spin-off and become Adient. This will be finalized on October 1, 2016, and begin to be publicly traded on the NYSE as ticker symbol ADNT on October 3, 2016.[51]
Joint ventures[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions (JCS) was a joint venture between Johnson Controls and French battery company Saft Groupe S.A..[52] It was officially launched in January 2006.[53]
Varta established a JCS development centre at its German HQ, following the setting-up of Varta-SAFT joint venture.[53]
Johnson Controls is exhibiting a plug-in hybrid concept called the re3. Johnson Controls produced cells for lithium-ion hybrid vehicle batteries in France under the joint venture with Saft. Battery assemblies were developed and produced in Hannover(Germany) and Milwaukee(USA)[54]
Despite some signs of promise, Johnson Controls was increasingly dissatisfied with the restrictions of the agreement and also sought a more important ally.[55][56] In May 2011, the American company requested the dissolution of Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions LLC to the Delaware Court of Chancery.[55][56] The two companies agreed to the separation and Johnson Controls paid Saft 145 million dollars for its shares in the joint venture as well as for the right to use certain technology developed by it. Johnson Controls retained the Michigan facility built by the partnership. The French joint facility was transferred to Saft.[57][58][59]
Other[edit]

Brookfield Johnson Controls is a joint venture with Brookfield Properties to provide commercial property management services in Canada. Established in 1992, it was known as Brookfield LePage Johnson Controls or BLJC until May 2015. In 2013, Johnson Controls and Brookfield Asset Management formed a similar joint venture Australia and New Zealand.[60]

Johnson Controls International Plc is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in Cork, Ireland[2] that produces automotive parts such as batteries and electronics and HVAC equipment for buildings. It employs 170,000 people in more than 1,300 locations across six continents. As of 2016[update] it was listed 242nd in the Fortune Global 500[3]; in 2017 it became ineligible for the Fortune 500, as it was headquartered outside the U.S.[4]
The company was formed via the merger of U.S. company Johnson Controls with Tyco International, announced on January 25, 2016. The merger led to the avoidance of U.S. taxes of its foreign market operations and a financial windfall for the CEO.[5][6]

History[edit]




A Johnson Super-Sensitive Thermometer on an air conditioning unit


In 1883, Warren S. Johnson, a professor at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin, received a patent for the first electric room thermostat. His invention helped launch the building control industry and was the impetus for a new company. Johnson and a group of Milwaukee investors incorporated the Johnson Electric Service Company in 1885 to manufacture, install and service automatic temperature regulation systems for buildings. After Johnson's death in 1911, the company decided to focus on its temperature control business for nonresidential buildings. The company was renamed Johnson Controls in 1974.
On November 21, 2005, Johnson Controls Inc. said it must restate financial results for fiscal years 2003 and 2004 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2005. The changes would have no impact on net income, earnings per share or the financial position as previously reported.[7] During the 2008-2009 recession, the company president Keith Wandell lobbied Congress for a bailout of the companies Johnson supplied.[8] The Johnson Controls plant in Lakeshore, Ontario closed in late March 2010 and the property was sold.[9] In 2013, Stephen Roell retired and Alex Molinaroli took his position as CEO and chairman of the board.[10]
On October 31, 2016, the former Johnson Controls Automotive Experience division was spun off as a separate, publicly traded company, Adient plc, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] In March 2017, it was announced that Scott Safety, its safety gear business, would be bought by 3M for $2 billion.[12]

Merger with Tyco[edit]
In January 2016, Johnson Controls merged with Tyco International to create a company headquartered in Cork, Ireland.[13] The new company is called Johnson Controls International Plc.[14]
Hillary Clinton condemned the company for wanting to escape U.S. taxes through the merger after having "begged" the government for financial help in 2008.[15] The Johnson deal, termed "outrageous"[16] by Fortune magazine, qualifies as a "super inversion" because Tyco shareholders will own 44% of the company, thus avoiding penalties that the United States Department of the Treasury has imposed on other inversion deals.[citation needed]
The firm estimated it would save about one hundred and fifty million dollars in a year by avoiding American taxes..[17]
Women's work rights[edit]
In 1982, Johnson Controls enacted what it called a "fetal protection policy", which denied women the right to work on the battery production line because of the potential harm to a fetus they might conceive. Women were allowed to work on the production line only if they could prove that "...their inability to bear children had been medically documented." In April 1984, the United Auto Workers sued Johnson Controls on behalf of three employees. These employees were Mary Craig, who had chosen to be sterilized to avoid losing her job, Elsie Nason, a 50-year-old divorcee, who had suffered a loss of compensation when she was transferred from a high paying job that exposed her to lead, and Donald Penney, who had been denied a request for a leave of absence for the purpose of lowering his blood lead levels because he intended to become a father. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 10, 1990 and was decided on March 20, 1991. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. This was a landmark ruling because it affirmed that "...it is no more important for the courts than it is for individual employers to decide whether a woman's reproductive role is more important to herself and her family than her economic role."[18]
Business units[edit]
The company’s operations are segmented into four business units: Building Efficiency, Global WorkPlace Solutions, Power Solutions and Automotive Experience.
Building Efficiency[edit]
The Building Efficiency business unit designs, produces, installs and services heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, industrial refrigeration, building management systems, fire and security systems and mechanical equipment for commercial and residential buildings. The brands produced under this business unit are York, TempMaster, Metasys, Panoptix, Frick and Sabroe.[19] This unit also works with organizations to reduce the energy consumption and operating costs of their buildings.[19][20] This includes retrofitting existing buildings such as the Empire State Building[21] and working on maximizing efficiency in new construction such as the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.[22] Building Efficiency is the company’s longest-running business unit, dating to 1885 when Johnson founded the Johnson Electric Service Company[23] after patenting the electric thermostat in 1883.[24] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 700 branch offices in more than 150 countries.[19]
Johnson Controls was one of the defendants in a multimillion-dollar federal court lawsuit in San Juan, Puerto Rico in a case where 98 people perished and 140 were injured in a fire at the DuPont Plaza Hotel and its casino on New Year’s Eve, December 31, 1986. The plaintiffs claimed that Johnson Controls sold and installed an energy management system that failed to give early warning of the fire.[25] After nine months of trial, the company and its energy management system were absolved of blame when the court issued a directed verdict.[26][27] When this trial was completed the plaintiffs had accumulated approximately $220,908,549.00 in damages as a result of various settlements and a jury verdict against some other defendants.[28]
Global WorkPlace Solutions[edit]
The Global WorkPlace Solutions business unit provides outsourced facilities management services globally.[29] It also manages corporate real estate on behalf of its customers including acquiring and disposing of property, administering leases, and managing building related projects such as equipment replacements.[30] On September 23, 2015, CBRE, Inc. purchased the Global Workplace Solutions business unit, retaining the name "Global Workplace Solutions".[31]
Power Solutions[edit]
The Power Solutions business unit designs and manufactures automotive batteries for passenger cars, heavy and light duty trucks, utility vehicles, motorcycles, golf carts and boats.[19][32][33][34][35] It supplies more than one third of the world’s lead-acid batteries[36] to automakers and aftermarket retailers including Wal-Mart, Sears and BMW.[37][38][39] Lead acid battery brands produced under this business unit include OPTIMA, Heliar, LTH, and VARTA automotive batteries.[19] This part of the company also manufactures Lithium-ion cells and complete battery systems to power hybrid and electric vehicles such as the Ford Fusion[40] and Daimler’s S-Class 400.[41] Additionally, it manufactures Absorbent Glass Matt (AGM) and Enhanced Flooded Batteries (EFB) batteries to power Start-Stop vehicles such as the Chevy Malibu and Ford Fusion.[19][36][42][43][44][45][46][47] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 60 locations worldwide.[19]
Automotive Experience[edit]
The Automotive Experience business unit supplies automotive seating, interiors and electronics to automakers.[19][36] It is one of the largest suppliers of car interiors in the world.[48] The seating division designs and manufactures automotive seats and supplies them on a just-in-time schedule. It also designs and manufactures seating components, including mechanisms, tracks, structures foams, fabrics and trim, making Johnson Controls the largest automotive seat supplier in the world.[49] A separate interiors division produces overhead systems, headliners, door panels, instrument panels, and overhead and floor consoles for automotive interiors.[19] Additionally, an electronics division designs and manufactures analog and digital instrument clusters, infotainment systems and hands free electronics.[19][50] Brands produced under this business unit include RECARO automotive seats and Keiper.[48] As of 2012, the business unit operated from 240 locations worldwide.[19] On January 12, 2016 Johnson Controls announced that its remaining Automotive Experience holdings will spin-off and become Adient. This will be finalized on October 1, 2016, and begin to be publicly traded on the NYSE as ticker symbol ADNT on October 3, 2016.[51]
Joint ventures[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions[edit]
Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions (JCS) was a joint venture between Johnson Controls and French battery company Saft Groupe S.A..[52] It was officially launched in January 2006.[53]
Varta established a JCS development centre at its German HQ, following the setting-up of Varta-SAFT joint venture.[53]
Johnson Controls is exhibiting a plug-in hybrid concept called the re3. Johnson Controls produced cells for lithium-ion hybrid vehicle batteries in France under the joint venture with Saft. Battery assemblies were developed and produced in Hannover(Germany) and Milwaukee(USA)[54]
Despite some signs of promise, Johnson Controls was increasingly dissatisfied with the restrictions of the agreement and also sought a more important ally.[55][56] In May 2011, the American company requested the dissolution of Johnson Controls-Saft Advanced Power Solutions LLC to the Delaware Court of Chancery.[55][56] The two companies agreed to the separation and Johnson Controls paid Saft 145 million dollars for its shares in the joint venture as well as for the right to use certain technology developed by it. Johnson Controls retained the Michigan facility built by the partnership. The French joint facility was transferred to Saft.[57][58][59]
Other[edit]

Brookfield Johnson Controls is a joint venture with Brookfield Properties to provide commercial property management services in Canada. Established in 1992, it was known as Brookfield LePage Johnson Controls or BLJC until May 2015. In 2013, Johnson Controls and Brookfield Asset Management formed a similar joint venture Australia and New Zealand.[60]

Product Description▼▲
Theologians have long assumed that Karl Barth's doctrine of election is supralapsarian.Challenging decades of scholarship, Shao Kai Tseng argues that despite Barth's stated favor of supralapsarianism, his mature lapsarian theology is complex and dialectical, critically reappropriating both supra- and infralapsarian patterns of thinking. Barth can be described as basically infralapsarian because he sees the object of election as fallen humankind and understands the incarnation as God's act of taking on human nature in its condition of fallenness.Tseng shows that most of Barth's Reformed critics have not understood his doctrine of election accurately enough to recognize his affinity to infralapsarianism and, conversely, that most Barthians have not understood Reformed-orthodox formulations of election with sufficient accuracy in their disagreement with the tradition. Karl Barth's Infralapsarian Theology offers a clear understanding of both the historic Lapsarian Controversy and Barth's distinct form of lapsarianism, providing a charitable dialogue partner to aid mutual understanding between Barth and evangelicals.

Endorsements▼▲
Through a detailed study of the development of Karl Barth's theology against the background of the Lapsarian Controversy of the seventeenth century, Tseng shows that Barth's professed 'purified supralapsarianism' is in fact a transformed vision of Christology and predestination in which both infralapsarian and supralapsarian elements play an important role. Tseng's headline claim that Barth's mature view is best described (contra Barth himself) as 'basically infralapsarian' is and will no doubt remain controversial. Yet at the same time, his fine-grained presentation of Barth's Christological doctrine of election as a dialectical admixture of supra- and infralapsarian patterns of thinking builds a persuasive case and, moreover, models a hearty mode of theological inquiry that is refreshing in an era grown chary of dogmatic reflection.
-Joel D. S. Rasmussen, 
associate professor of nineteenth-century Christian thought, University of Oxford

Swimming against the currents of common opinion, Shao Kai Tseng offers a fresh and provocative argument that Karl Barth was not a supra- but infralapsarian. Such a claim will undoubtedly raise eyebrows, but Tseng presents a convincing case rooted in a careful analysis of the original seventeenth-century debate and Barth's own extensive writings. Without hesitation I can say that this is a must-read book for anyone who wants a better understanding of Barth's theology. But this book is also important for anyone who wrestles with how to explain God's relationship with fallen humanity, the doctrine of Christ, time and eternity, and election and salvation.
-J. V. Fesko, 
Westminster Seminary California

Shao Kai Tseng's text is a most impressive piece of scholarship. His topic of predestination, with a focus on Barth, chimes in with the important debate in Barth scholarship on election in relation to Trinity. This book will take its place as further evaluation and revision of the interpretation of predestination in Barth's theology. I commend the work by this emerging Asian theologian wholeheartedly.
-Timothy Bradshaw, 
University of Oxford

Shao Kai Tseng's new book tackles a problem that many have regarded as metaphysical and, as such, impossibly obscure. However, Tseng's study shows not only that the choice between a supralapsarian and infralapsarian view was of perennial concern to Barth but that it also dovetails with central aspects of his christological thinking. Tseng approaches the subject by means of a careful scrutiny of key texts as well as of relevant secondary literature. He has an exceptional and welcome ability to juggle the highly technical vocabulary of Reformed dogmatics in such a way as to show how the issues are of importance to all Christian thought.
-George Pattison, 
1640 Chair of Divinity, University of Glasgow

Was God's original will to enter into covenant relations with his creatures an act that took place because of the fall or irrespective of the fall? The answer that this significant study provides is that it is both, with more weight attached to the latter view. Ordinarily one might wonder what the relevance of a study of Barth's supralapsarian and infralapsarian emphases might be both for Barth scholars and the church. In this carefully argued, well-researched and well-documented exploration of the development and implications of Barth's doctrines of election and Christology, Shao Kai Tseng demonstrates exactly why such a study is important. We learn exactly how Barth could forcefully present the power of God's grace by focusing on Jesus Christ as 'electing God and elected human,' rather than on a decretum absolutum, while at the same time taking account of God's good creation as it is menaced by sin and death. Since God is really free as the one who loves within the immanent Trinity, we know that God's love of the world in election and incarnation is effective for all, just because God's self-determination to be for us is irrevocable as an action of love that corresponds perfectly with God's self-sufficient act of love in the freedom of the immanent Trinity. This is certainly a book that Barth scholars will want to read and discuss. But it is a book that will engage and inform all theologians who are concerned about how to understand God's love and freedom for us today in a way that does justice to both God's love and God's freedom.
-Paul D. Molnar, 
professor of systematic theology, St. John's University, Queens, NY

            Shao Kai Tseng is assistant professor of Systematic Theology at China Evangelical Seminary in Taipei, Taiwan. Tseng has a D.Phil. from the University of Oxford and has authored a number of books and scholarly articles in both English and Chinese. Much of Tsengs ongoing research has centered around the theology of Karl Barth. Tseng brings an interesting perspective to the current trends within Barth studies, and the present volume is a clear example of keen reflection and distilled scholarship. 


Karl Barths Infralapsarian Theology: Origins and Development 1920-1953 is made up of two major sections: (1) Reappraising Barths Lapsarian Position and (2) Barths Lapsarian Position in Development, 1920-1953. The first portion of Tsengs investigation provides some definitional groundwork for the lapsarian problem. Tseng explains, what defines supralapsarianism in general is the thesis that in election-reprobation God considers humanity as unfallen, while what defines infralapsarianism is the view that eternal double predestinationbefore the actual creation of the worldGod conceives of fallen humanity as the object of election-reprobation (p. 61). It is here that Tseng then reevaluates Barths position and his self-identification with the former lapsarian position.


Still, Barths lapsarian convictions are far more complex than that allowed by a simple ascription to a supralapsarianism position. For Tseng, the complex and dialectical nature of Barths lapsarian thinking, along with his doctrine of election outlined in CDII/2, could be described as basically infralapsarian (p. 79). Thus, the second portion of Tsengs investigation seeks to establish this conclusion further by chronologically examining the development of Barths lapsarian position from Rmerbrief II (1920-1921) to CDIV/1 (1951-1953). This latter section comprises the majority of the book and Tseng does well in guiding the reader to his intended conclusions. Tseng concludes that regardless of Barths avowed sympathy for the supralapsarian ordering of divine decrees, Barths Christocentric doctrine of election . . . has in fact been a robustly complex scheme in which supra- and infralapsarian theological incentives and patterns of thinking . . . have been dialectically interwoven (p. 290). In other words, a simple ascription to a supralapsarianism in Barths theology is just thatsimple.            




Those familiar with the landscape of Karl Barth and Barth studies will be able to examine the investigation of this book with more scrutiny than others. This is not a book written with a general readership in mind. It is both technical and dense, but rich with insight and theological reflection. If anything the reader will walk away encouraged that new explorations in theological studies are possible, which makes this title a perfect fit for the series in which it resides. This is a book that I can recommend for those interested or invested in Barth studies. It is a new page turned in the complex study of one of the twentieth centuries most influential figure. Still, for those who are looking for an entrance ramp into the conversation, I would recommend looking elsewhere.


I received a review copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commissions 16 CFR, Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.
