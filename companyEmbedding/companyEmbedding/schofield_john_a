John Wayne. Duke.  The quintessential Western film star.  A symbol of American values.  An international icon. You’ve heard his voice in countless, classic films. At the mere sound of it, you can be transported back in time.  It’s unmistakable. In our heads we can still hear him saying, “I won’t be wronged, I won’t be insulted, and I won’t be laid a hand on”, or “Talk low, Talk slow, and don’t say too much.” 
John Wayne believed that “A Man Ought To Do What He Thinks Is Right.”  He proved this over and over again throughout his life, as well as in his film career which spanned over five decades.  A man as legendary as John Wayne deserves a legendary Tribute.  He deserves more than an ordinary firearm—he deserves a conversation piece. That’s why today, America Remembers is especially proud to announce a classic western tribute, the John Wayne Tribute Schofield Revolver. This Tribute is issued on a firearm rooted in the Old West days of the legendary U.S. Cavalry troopers: the top-break Schofield revolver, based on the original Schofield designed by Major George Schofield with Smith & Wesson.

The John Wayne Tribute Schofield Revolver is a working revolver in caliber .44-40, a beautifully engineered firearm with a rich history. The revolver took its name from Major George W. Schofield of the 10th Cavalry. Around 1870 he wrote to Smith & Wesson requesting one of their then-new “Model No. 3” revolvers, in the hopes it would prove useful in battle. Schofield made his own modifications to the Model No. 2 to meet the Cavalry’s needs, including moving the release latch from the barrel to the frame. In 1875, Smith & Wesson incorporated these refinements into a design they named after the Major.
A common sight in the holsters of scouts, cowboys, lawmen, outlaw and Cavalrymen, the Schofield top-break revolver is truly a classic of the Old West. Hold the John Wayne Tribute Schofield Revolver, and be transported back to the days when John Wayne was on screen in that familiar, instantly-recognizable U.S. Cavalry uniform: the navy-blue and yellow, with the yellow stripe down the leg. You’ll immediately think of John Wayne is such classic movies as She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Rio Grande, The Horse Soldiers, and Fort Apache. Each working revolver in this edition is produced for us by the master craftsmen of Uberti. Craftsmen commissioned specifically for this project by America Remembers decorate each John Wayne Schofield Revolver in elegant 24-karat gold and gleaming nickel, and the entire project has been carried out with the authorization and approval of John Wayne Enterprises.
 

The John Wayne Schofield Revolver is issued in a limited edition of only 1,500 revolvers, available exclusively from America Remembers. Each museum-quality Tribute is accompanied by a Certificate of Authenticity, numbered to that specific revolver.  We will arrange delivery of your working Tribute through the licensed firearms dealer of your choice. As always, you will receive your Tribute with our 30-day guarantee of satisfaction. If you are not completely satisfied, you may return your Tribute to us in original, unfired condition for a complete and courteous refund.
 Here, two Old West legends come together to create a classic piece of American firearms history. Act today, and you can acquire this classic Western firearm, handsomely decorated with artwork honoring America’s most popular Western film legend.  When you hold it, you will be back in the dusty Old West, where John Wayne reigned as the quintessential Hollywood cowboy.
On the left side of the revolver, you’ll find two classic portraits of John Wayne. On the cylinder, you’ll find a classic close-up of John Wayne, featured in nickel with a gold background inside of a gold-plated oval frame. The huge sky and the long clouds belong unmistakably to the American Western landscape.  A gold banner beneath the portrait features a faithful recreation of John Wayne’s signature. The frame features John Wayne on horseback, in the streets of an Old West town. The barrel includes John Wayne’s famous saying: A Man Oughta Do What He Thinks Is Right.
The right side features two portraits of John Wayne as well. On the cylinder is a close-up of John Wayne gazing into the Western landscape, wearing his hat and bandana with clouds in the background. On the frame, you’ll find a classic portrait of Duke relaxing on a fence. In the background, you will find the mesas and buttes that recall the wild beauty of his Western film locations. The balance of the revolver features an overall blued mirror finish, and the grips are highly polished walnut. Along the barrel is another of John Wayne’s classic sayings: Courage Is Being Scared To Death, But Saddling Up Anyway.

This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Hardcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1994 edition. Volume: 1994 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This hardcover book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of hardcover binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal hardcovers. This book is printed on demand on acid-free paper.
