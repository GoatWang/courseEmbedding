Strategic Income Plus: Dare to be Different
 
What does “dare to be different” mean in the investing world? There has been a lot of attention in the media regarding “alternatives” to traditional investments over the last several years. Many so-called alternatives do not provide the benefits they claim to, and offer pitfalls to the unwary. At ClearArc Capital, we feel our Strategic Income Plus strategy provides access to the desirable facets of an alternative strategy.
