She was born with Pierre Robin Sequence at our local hospital and then transferred to Riley Hospita.At Riley Dr Tahiri was one of the first professionals we meet and he was confident and knowledgeable about our girl's condition. As soon as he walked in the room, he described to us her condition and treatment and what we should expect from it, he even gave us an approximated of how long she would stay there and he was right.  Thanks to him, we felt positive because he was able to make us feel like we were in the right place with the right professionals.         There are not enough words to describe how thankful we are to have him as our surgeon and be able to provided a better quality of life to our little girl. He is an upstanding surgeon with a good attitude and those types of doctors that you are able to feel comfortable to ask any questions and be able to trust his judgment without a doubt.Indiana University Med Ctr: Tahiri Hassani, Youssef MDTracy M. ratedDr. Tahiri made us feel at ease from the moment we met him!  He did an absolutely amazing job on my son's unilateral cleft lip.  Those who know our story are in awe when seeing the results after just 4 1/2 months...and those whom we just meet usually have no idea our son even had a cleft lip.It's a scary thing to have your infant go through a surgery so young and Dr. Tahiri took great care of both our son and also paid special attention to us!  We had multiple appointments leading up to the surgery to make sure all our questions were answered and he took the time with us - never making us feel rushed.His explanations & professional attitude are on-point and he has a sense of ease about him that makes you feel taken care of.  His work speaks for itself when seeing before & after pictures.  He is a genuine individual who truly cares about making the future bright for all those who are cleft affected.Indiana University Med Ctr: Tahiri Hassani, Youssef MDMatt n kate A. ratedDr. Tahiri is amazing. We can't say enough good things about him. He is knowledgeable about his craft and truly prides himself in his work, and he cares about it because he is changing the lives of children for the better. He is, by far the most personable surgeon we have met in our years of multiple surgeons, and our 2 year old son likes and trust him despite having been through multiple surgeries with him. Dr. Tahiri takes the time to thoroughly explain things to the family and sincerely values the concerns and opinions of others involved. He has also taken the time to personally call me to answer questions I had as well as filling out extra paperwork when I was applying for a grant. We hope we never have to use another craniofacial surgeon. Dr. Tahiri is, in my opinion, the best there is!Indiana University Med Ctr: Tahiri Hassani, Youssef MDSierra W. ratedThere are not enough words to describe how special Dr. Tahiri is to our family. He has been our plastic surgeon since our youngest son Owen was born in July 2014. Owen has many health problems and we couldn't ask for a better surgeon to be on our team. Not only is he a well known, well respected surgeon with a great surgical record, he genuinely cares about his patients and their families. He has personally called us after hours and on weekends with test results that we were anxiously waiting for. He goes above and beyond his duties as our plastic surgeon. When you're told your one week old baby needs major jaw surgery in order to breath, having a surgeon like Dr. Tahiri makes the situation as good as it can possibly be. We are forever grateful for what he has done for us. Sierra WatsonFamily BeginningsCarly W. ratedI wanted to write this review in hopes of helping others who are seeking a fertility specialist.  A positive or negative experience with staff can make or break your infertility journey.  With that being said,  I believe  Dr. Donahue is an excellent physician and person- but his office staff is terrible and insensitive.  I often felt very uneasy, because most of the correspondence came from his 2 nurses whom I did not trust, based on things that happened during my time there.   My husband and I felt that we were an inconvenience when we lost our babies- which is a horrible shame.   We have since moved on to another specialist and love both the doctor and his staff.  From experience, I can say this makes a huge difference!  Please do your research. Sokol Deborah K MDdjprince ratedDr. Deborah Sokol has been tak...Dr. Deborah Sokol has been taking care of my son's epilepsy for a while now. She does real well with him as long as she has time to go through his file first or someone (me) refreshes her memory about him each and every time you go there. She forgets to write prescriptions with all the legal requirments so you have trouble getting them filled. This doctor is ok in a pinch but I suggest trying to find one that will actually TRY to acquaint themselves with your child prior to suggesting med reductions or discontinuations. Be careful with this one, be your child's full time active advocate or your child gets lost in the shuffle!Rani, Dolly, MDRena B. ratedI was diagnosed with  hyperactive thyroidism by Dr. Dolly Rani, she was very personal and professional. I was scared and upset. She was reassuring and told me through my options of getting on the right track to get well.I would recommend Dr. Rani to anyone who may live in Indianapolis, IN, or if you are thinking of moving here and you have thyroid problems and need a specialist she is one of the best doctors in her field. It's been three years and the symptoms associated with this disease have improved like she said they would and my thyroid is within the normal range.JWM Neurology PCLisa S. ratedwonderful staffI have recently been diagnosed with Ms and was referred to Dr George.  Dr George was wonderful, she took the time I needed to understant what was going on, and listened to my concerns.  Very unsure of the diagnoses and of the out come we were very upset, but the staff was wonderful very understanding,  didn't rush me, took the time to explain every step, even the office manager took the time to greet me and gave me her business card and told me to call if I ever needed anything, we were very impresses with the care I received.St Vincent's HospitalHaley L. ratedI am a patient in the Family and Medicine Clinic, I want to start off by saying that I love my doctor, the problem that I have with this facility is the front office team, especially Yolanda... She is extremely rude every time I come in. The front office team does not acknowledge that they have patients standing right in front of them. It takes Yolanda five minutes or more to check me in. She never makes eye contact, never smiles and always has an attitude. It is extremely unprofessional, she lacks customer service skills.Indiana University Med Ctr: Tahiri Hassani, Youssef MDJenny O. ratedI was the mother of a newborn  with pierre  robin  sequence  and a cleft palate   that was found out at birth and if that wasn't  stressful  enough it was found he needed to have jaw distraction! Dr. Tahiri  came in and immediately  hugged me and detailed  what the distraction  surgery would be like and the recovery! The day of surgery another hug and a "I will take care of him as if he were my own kid" and I know my son was in good hands! Amazing  doctor  and man!Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
