Lynn Trefzger
Ventriloquist Comedienne










Simon










Yes, there IS a real dummy! Lynn's lifelong sidekick is best at
improv with his sarcastic personality. He hates to be known as the
"freaky puppet", and in turn, brings audience members up on stage
for their chance to see what it feels like! Thus, making
unsuspecting bystanders into a "human dummies" . A routine that is
a highlight of every show!
