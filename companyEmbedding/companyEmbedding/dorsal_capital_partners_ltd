What are the best selling products for college students? When you suddenly find yourself free and with plenty of cash in your hands, the first thing you want to do is to go shopping for good stuff. Most kids are sent off to college with presents of cash from family and friends. And you will obviously be given some money to start off your life as a college student – the first time you move away from home!
College students require a lot of stuff for their educational, social, and other requirements. Though the dorm space is usually small, a lot of things need to fit into it. This means that if you don’t want your room looking like a pigsty, you need things to organize your belongings. Every single thing you own or do is limited to your own room. Whether you like it or not, college life will mean plenty of personal belongings, though if you share a room, you might also get to share your roommate’s belongings. The thing is that you would need to know where things are so that you can use them. If you can never find them, then you are wasting space and money, both of which a student simply can’t afford. Some of the products that would be interesting for college students are Unjumbly Superior Over the Door Shoe Organizer, Avery Mini Filler Paper, and APC Surge Protector Bundle.
Unjumbly Superior Over the Door Shoe Organizer is excellent for organizing your shoes properly. It gets the shoes out of the way and minimizes the clutter in the room. You can also find whatever you want to wear within seconds. With 24 pockets, this product can hold a lot of footwear! It rates 4.8 on Amazon and no wonder! Paper is very important for college students. These Avery Mini Filler Paper packs are punched with seven holes each and come in packs of 100 sheets. The rating for this product is 4.7! Surge protectors are important in college. What if you lose your device where you have stored everything? To prevent that, use the product – APC Surge Protector Bundle, which has six outlets and three US ports. 
To know more about the bestselling products for college students, take a look at our list, which has been compiled with reference to Amazon and ranked according to the ratings.

		Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a ‘Buy’ Ahead of New Product Launches: Charles Payne

Companies, Inside Tech, Tech




Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is going to launch much awaited iPhone 6 next month according to the reports. Answering the question about Apple’s stock and whether it is a ‘Buy’ or not in a program on Fox Business, Charles Payne said that Apple is a ‘Buy’ because after the new product launches, it will regain its charm and touch new heights. Payne also said that the latest reports of new iPads can also give a lift to the Apple stock, but Apple must be vigilant about the cannibalization because of two product releases. He said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does not normally come up the to the hypes of the media.

“I do think Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a ‘Buy’, I am an Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our subscribers are an Apple, and Apple has reclaimed some of that charm, […] I think when this thing gets over a hundred bucks, it’s going to regain some of that legendary status […],” said Payne.
Payne said that there is no news so far about the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s TV and Apple has probably delayed this product because of new iPhone 6 and tablet releases. He also said that a bigger version of iPhone 6 will likely deplete the iPad sales, because the phablet version of iPhone 6 will serve the purpose for which iPads are bought.
FBN’s Tracy Byrnes said that Apple cannibalizes the sales very often and keeps its customers waiting for the new products. She said that Tim Cook has a strategy of not releasing Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products at once to keep the customers waiting and excited about the upcoming releases. She also said that there is a high chance that the bigger version of iPhone 6 will be released after the smaller version.
