Thomas Looby
Thank you Debbie and thanks everyone for dialing in to our call this afternoon. This quarter had mixed results. I am very satisfied with the progress that our team has made as we move along our path to become standard of care and our healthcare program and standard of use in our Eksoworks program thanks to the team's hard work over the last quarters we have a lot of green shoots starting to rise up that we are confident will enhance the market and financial picture for Ekso. Study data is up, utilization in the clinic is up, demos, a lead indicator of future sales or rentals are up, EMEA's team is rebuilding and we recently moved from introductory phase to commercial phase for our EksoZeroG mount system. Having said that I am not satisfied, we as a company are not satisfied with the unit shipments of our Ekso GT and our first quarter. For me 10 units shipped is not satisfactory nor its sustainable and for two quarters in a row EMEA was particularly soft.
We are well aware of these that these are not the result that any of us are striving for. I will go into rehabilitation sales and our intent and focus on the bottom line in more detail shortly but first a few notes on this quarter and our achievements. We shipped 10 Ekso GT units, seven of which were sales. We now have 225 medical devices in the field of which 215 were sold and 10 are under a rental agreement, at 169 customers in North America and EMEA.

We have built strong sales analytics to make sure our sales force can be as efficient and effective as possible this includes tracking our funnel through the various stages of the sales cycle to understand the conversion rates and timing. We have provided the opportunity for individuals who cannot take a step on their own to take over 74 million steps at more than 150,000 patient sessions. We can track this because of our real time data capture system called EksoPulse. We have now signed up five centers with IRB [ph] approvals in place in our important WISE study, this is the first randomized multi-centered clinical trial within the exoskeleton industry.
We were the subject of a medical innovation briefing released by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, the institute specifically called out our proprietary SmartAssist software, the technology which intelligently adjusts to a patient session at over sessions step after step. We launched our centers of excellence peer to peer advocacy program and listing initial fourth centers from the U.S. and another first in the industry to help us educate existing and potential customers on the clinical benefit and value proposition of the Ekso GT.
Now to what is happening on the sales front for the Ekso GT, a very important piece of our sales analytics process is understanding the indicators of uptake in this market and it is in how we are developing our pipeline. We believe that the number of demos we perform at potential customers is one of the best and most reliable indicators of future sales. With our particular focus over the last nine months and better understanding the customer we have seen our quarterly demos in the U.S. grow from an average of approximately 16 demo's per quarter prior to our FDA clearance to 27 demos this past quarter in the U.S. alone. Europe held 20 demos in the same quarter.
Our target remains on track to reach 60 demos per quarter, 30 in the U.S. and 30 in EMEA by the end of 2017 ultimately a successful direct sales rep is expected to place a minimum of one unit per month. As we hone in on an optimal sales we're also seeing the first signs of a shortening in the sales cycle prior to getting our label for stroke and spinal cord injury sales cycles range from 12 to 18 months. Now with our clearance in hand we are successfully informing a broader number of clinics about the use of our exoskeleton and this allows our sales people to be more focused and efficient on developing the all-important demo and closing business. As a result of these efforts our average sales cycle went below 12 months over the past quarter including two shipments that went from demo to sale within the quarter. In our efforts to further identify the best customers for the Ekso GT we are beginning pilot projects in the next few weeks with two leading post-acute care companies to explore how the Ekso GT can help them provide better clinical outcomes more efficiently within skilled nursing facilities.
Based upon claims data we have analyzed a large number of stroke rehabilitation happens within skilled nursing facilities. This we believe represents a large untapped market for Ekso Bionics. Of course an essential tool for our sales and marketing team is educating our market on the clinical data and results of using our products I was pleased to see that our recent clinical webinar we had over 200 participants learn about the rapidly growing body of clinical studies and away with the Ekso GT. In total there are currently 55 independent studies on the Ekso GT 33 of which have been completed and 22 are still enrolling patients. Together these studies will include more than 1200 participants overall.
Some of the specific compelling outcomes observed include a 150% to 200% increase in dosage in stroke patients compared to standard physical therapy. The most notable difference in dosage came at the first sessions 443 three feet walked [ph] in Ekso versus seven feet walked in standard physical therapy. Improved gait parameter such as increased stride length, decreased step width, and improved symmetry on both affected and unaffected sides walking in Ekso GT compared to gait training and current physical therapy. Improved gait speed, balance, motor activity and control and finally statistically significant improved functional independent motor scores from admission to discharge. Ultimately we believe that the outcomes with our device will reduce the cost to the healthcare system. It is part of some of the studies underway to show cost reduction outcomes.

A big driver of clinical outcomes we believe relate to the Ekso GT with our powerful SmartAssist software being a great rehabilitation tool that allows for early mobilization, higher per session step count and more economically viable gait sessions. SmartAssist enables therapist to use the Ekso GT to rewire a patient central nervous system, a concept known as neuroplasticity. We now have had a number of customers share their experience where they have had a patient that they thought would never walk independently again go through their rehabilitation using the Ekso GT and see that patient walk out of the device this is incredibly exciting for us and represents the fantastic potential of the technology. Ultimately our goal is to demonstrate that better health at discharge can help reduce the cost burden on healthcare systems through a reduction and readmissions and other costs associated with stroke and spinal cord injury. In North America alone the cost to treat stroke is projected to more than double from $72 billion in 2010 to $183 billion in 2030.
Our Ekso GT is the optimal tool to mitigate this. Along with our clinical evidence program we recently added a peer advocacy program, our centers of excellence program. The charter members are Villa Beretta in Europe and (inaudible) Good Shepherd and (inaudible) in North America.
This program is the first of its kind peer to peer advocacy program to its some of our key customers and thought leaders can share their real life experiences with fellow clinics to discuss the clinical, business and financial merits of using the Ekso GT as a tool in rehabilitation. On the industrial side this past quarter we went from what I would describe as an introductory phase to a commercial phase with our showing at world of concrete. We began with our EksoZeroG mount system where we had sold close to 200 units and the customer base has broadened from a handful to over 20. We now have three manufacturing rep agencies signed and in total have 30 sales employees trained for the North American market and we've started to look at international markets as well. We maintain our target to at least double sales in 2017 from the $1.2 million we hit in 2016.
In addition we plan to introduce our Ekso Vest by the third quarter of this year. This momentum affords us the opportunity to also proactively pursue strategic opportunities and partnerships to ensure Eksoworks taps into what we believe is a significant business opportunity while minimizing our own cash investment in this area. At this point I'd like to hand the call the Max, our CFO to talk about our financial results for the first quarter.
Max Scheder-Bieschin
Thanks, Tom. Total reported revenue for Q1 2017 was 1.4 million compared to 8.5 million in Q1 2016. As a reminder the Q1 2016 revenue number includes a 6.5 million one-time non-cash recognition of previously deferred medical device revenue. The breakdown for Q1 2017 revenue is as follows. We recognize approximately 900,000 in medical device and related revenue down from 1.5 million in Q1 2016. While the unit placements this quarter were comparable to last year we shipped some units as rentals this quarter impacting revenue by approximately 400,000. We recognize approximately 0.5 million in Eksoworks revenue compared with a 100,000 in the same period a year ago and in engineering services we recognize the last of our revenue from our soft exoskeleton project with DARPA. Our overall gross profit for the quarter was 400,000 for gross margin of 25%. This compares to a gross margin for the same period last year of 18%. Operating expenses for the first quarter 2017 were 8.5 million compared to 8.1 million for the first quarter 2016. The increase is driven by increases in clinical and marketing investments such as our company sponsored WISE study and by an increase in R&D investment to support our industrial and next generation whole mobility products. Net loss from operations for the quarter was 8.1 million as compared to 6.7 million net loss from operations in Q1, 2016. Cash used in operating activities for the quarter was 7.3 million as compared to 6.8 million for Q1 2016. As of March 31, 2017 we had a cash balance of $9.4 million not including the 11.7 million financing we announced April 3rd. A few final observations for you before I hand the call to Tom again, one as Tom mentioned we're more actively tracking a number of sales metrics to better understand and develop our pipeline. One such metric what we call qualified sales demos we will share going forward.

Our 2017 target is to average 60 demos per quarter, split 50:50 between North America and EMEA. This will be up significantly from the experience prior to our Q2, 2016 FDA clearance. Two, as you saw on our shipments we are seeing an increasing interest in Ekso GT rentals. To be clear these are short term rentals varying from 3 to 12 months with customers having the right to purchase the unit after the rental period. This will represent a challenge for us to guide on revenue targets, on the other hand this program might enable us to shorten the time line from first meeting to a close to accelerate unit placements. To-date we have placed 27 such rentals and in the last year we have seen all but one of these convert to a sale. We currently have 10 rentals in the field.
And three as we focus our sales and marketing and our R&D efforts over the coming quarters we are targeting a reduction in our cash burn to under 1.5 million per month by year end. Please see our accompanying earnings release and 10-Q for further details regarding the quarter and with that I will turn the call back to Tom.
Thomas Looby
Thanks, Max. The playbook for developing a medical market is quite clear, build great products, prove efficacy and safety for them, win clearance and establish a growing utilization of the product while building up a body of clinical and economic evidence on the path to expanding uptake and winning coding coverage and then payment.
By the way I think it's very much the same path for uptake in industrial markets where you also need great products, you need to prove a value proposition and you need to win orders. Winning clearance from the FDA for our targeted patient populations last year was a major breakthrough for us and for the industry it's a strong starting point for the missionary work we are doing as a company to further develop the market in accordance with this playbook. Along the way there are bumps to endure and as we navigate those bumps we also continue to test our strategy. We continually ask ourselves is the market real and does Ekso Bionics have a right to win.
What we are finding continues to validate our and others assertion for a large market opportunity. Consider a January 2017 article in The Economist which projects that physical therapist and physical therapist assistants as well as other rehabilitative healthcare professionals are projected to be among the fastest growing jobs in the U.S. and for good reason society is getting older and will require more resources to rehabilitate and provide mobility solutions, we assert that our technology will be used to leverage these scarce resources. Societies are getting older all over the globe in some places like China the craft of physical therapy is relatively new to, this profession of physical therapy will grow but we believe that technologies like the Ekso GT will be in demand driven by the scarcity of healthcare service providers in the coming years.
And in the industrial space we are experiencing not just the receptiveness to exoskeleton solutions for construction and assembly but an actual hunger to seek out solutions for jobs that have a higher safety risk as well as the need for productivity gains. As we chart the course in this evolving industry in order to prove not only that the opportunity is real but that we offer the best solution we continue to emphasize clinical data that supports adoption and reimbursement, powerful case study that demonstrate ROI for the value proposition of this technology for the hospital and for the clinical team, an effective and efficient sales team company operations intent on maximizing shareholders value and the right amount of technology to augment our customers drive for new standards and rehabilitation and on the workplace. Despite our Q1 revenues in our rehabilitation business we remain abundantly confident in our platform, product portfolio and strategy to continue building the best product for our markets. We are looking forward to better predictability in accelerating unit placement growth throughout the remainder of 2017.

With that I will end our prepared remarks and look forward to your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. First question is from Imron Zafar, Suntrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead, sir.
Imron Zafar
I wanted to go a little bit into the performance in medical, obviously the sequential trend was a little bit disappointing in terms of unit placement. So I just wonder if you can talk a little bit more about that dynamics' in that end market in terms of factors that may have impacted the performance whether it was executional or whether there was any impact from healthcare reform uncertainty, competitive dynamics or just Tom if you could just talk a little bit more about the performance in that business please.
Thomas Looby
Last week I spoke at an NIH hosted meeting where several med tech companies were talking about the time from FDA clearance to the time of significant market traction and I think that what Ekso Bionics is dealing with right now is sort of a traditional uptake. So we won our clearance in the middle of 2016. We knew very much what where all the patients were going, the 16000 clinics in the U.S. etcetera and we were starting to do the broad education that stroke is important and it's not just about spinal cord. We thought that maybe we'd be a little bit further along in that uptick in Q1 because we had a very good Q4 where we did see that uptick. So I think it's still there, I think it's still there, I think it's just some of that lumpiness. What we started in Q1 is really a deep dive on all the sales operational metrics, what is the real pipeline look like it etcetera and we then are starting to focus on some ways to streamline that pipeline making it easier for people to procure or using that technology with rentals and leases and as Max and I mentioned driving the all-important demo. We are seeing I think a pretty good yield when we do a demo, it’s a matter of time and these are the programs that we're going to really highlight moving forward in 2017.
Imron Zafar
Okay, and then last quarter you had talked about expectations for ending the year with the placement run-rate of about 10 units per month or 30 per quarter I wonder if that is still intact about that expectation or if you tampered that outlook?
Thomas Looby
Yes, through this deep dive on our sales again in the yield that we're seeing in demos we really like the building of that quality demo metric in Q1 and certainly we're focused on that in Q2 and beyond. So I think that we see that that's very much in focus for the U.S. group. I will say that in EMEA where we saw soft sales in Q4 and Q1 and we really had to rebuild that team over the past two quarters that they're going to get to that rate to be sure but I think that we feel more confident about doing that the United States.
Imron Zafar
Okay. And then the sales versus rentals unit mix that we saw on the quarter do you see that as more or less representative of what we should see for you know on a go forward basis and Max if you can just talk about what the gross margin implications are for a potentially higher mix of rental units versus sales?
Max Scheder-Bieschin
We started the rental program not all that long ago and with our balance sheet maybe testing it versus full deployment but I think we're very interested in a full deployment of that rental program and one of the things that we need to do is to really take a look at the contracts and how we go about that process with these hospitals because we want to make it easy for them and if a capital equipment purchase and a rental purchase more or less go at the same speed then the rental program is not performing for us. So I think that what we will do is really focus on streamlining both processes but seeing if that can actually be a program that can get a lot of traction, the rental program get a lot of traction here in the next couple quarters. 

Thomas Looby
On the gross margin side Imron, there are a little bit less than 30% on the rental side versus the device side and one of the things we neglected to mention are just ASP's in general and for direct sales we continue to see a slight uptick in those ASP's. So even though we didn't have all ten as sales, the seven that went out and those that were that direct had a slight uptick in the ASP's.
Imron Zafar
Okay. And then just one housekeeping question, did the 10 units, what was the U.S. versus Europe gait tone?
Thomas Looby
There are seven, we're in United States, three of which were rentals and three were in Europe. And Imron you asked before just so people know about it, today there are 169 units that we mentioned, 169 customers that are out there, 89 of which are North America, so North America is overtaken EMEA and EMEA has some 80 customers.
Operator
The next question is from Greg Chodaczek, B. Riley Financial. Please go ahead, sir.
Greg Chodaczek
The question is you received clearance in April of 2016. So now we're about a year end into it, we talked about the sales cycle and it does take time, I guess my question Tom is what was going on in the last nine months and what is going to change. Is it the people? Is it the type of marketing, I just last quarter was great this quarter it seems be a little hiccup and I'm just trying to figure out why?
Thomas Looby
Maybe you did make miss some -- its hard to know when you got on the call but first and foremost we had to start broad marketing for the stroke indication, not sales you know sales visit, the sales visit but really educating the market. We're doing that through the trade shows, we're doing that through social media which is an important channel today some other advertising and we're doing that through these webinars to educate people on the body of evidence. So we've gotten past this era I think of, hey exoskeletons are interesting and now we're in this era of they're important but why and why should I start to buy now. So that I think takes a little bit of time to get in. I think we still knock on doors that think that these devices are about spinal cord injury alone and has not been so compelling for them. The other thing is that we need to mature a little bit on our sales ops side about how to take a order and develop it all the way to a sale and we are now I think pretty clean on that funnel, so we've got very good visibility of when a sales cycle starts and how to mature that to in order.
Greg Chodaczek
I've asked this question in the past I'll ask it again. What's Good Shephard [indiscernible] know that nobody else knows in terms of Ekso?
Thomas Looby
Yes there are others out there besides those like Mary and Joy [ph] for example that are doing the same thing and just for the rest of the audience these people, these clinics that Greg mentioned are really great proof points. They buy one, they are not ones that have deep scientific budgets that do a lot of clinical trials at least initially and they really have to evaluate tools for the physical therapist on the merits of outcomes and also the economics and when they deploy these systems they're seeing those outcomes, they're seeing those economic proof points at 50% IRR for example in the case of Good Shepherd and then they buy their second and third and they start getting multiple devices and so it's our job to really provide those case studies in advance but say population based metrics which we all eventually will have but these case studies I think can win the day and what we're seeing is in our business still more multi-unit placements. You know it's easier to sell to an existing customer that is to a naïve customer and so we're seeing some of that. I think that maybe Greg what you're suggesting is it also taking a little bit of time for that traction to get there with other clinics and we would agree with you. We're fairly -- our eyes are open that it's taking longer than we wanted it to let's two quarters ago. But our sales cycle is down, the utilization of our devices are up quarter over quarter by 14% and I think that that is a bellwether for whether that clinic or those series of clinics will buy a second unit and as I said our demos are up from 16 to 27 per quarter in the U.S. in the last nine quarters. So there's real missionary work being done to develop this mark and that's why we're still encouraged about our future business here.

Greg Chodaczek
Okay. And this maybe another rehash but the Zero mount while moving to -- the zero mount is moving from introductory to commercial phase, you may have talked about that. Exactly what does that mean and does that also include the vest or we are going to have a introductory phase for the vest when that comes out hopefully in the second half of this year.
Thomas Looby
This is an example of that Ekso Bionics really maturing as a business. Few years ago we announced to the world that we're starting industrial and then we really learned what's getting into the industrial business meant, but over the last year we were sort of cautious to say that we were in full scale commercialization because we wanted to test our products out with a small group of customers and potential partners really learn the use cases, maybe even learn their business model so that if they are ere rental what are they getting per month for the rental of our unit to their customers. How many repeat users are they getting for their customers? United Rental has been fantastic partner in the early days but there's been others besides United Rental really giving us that feedback but now what we're seeing is a broadening of -- so we pressure tested the device, we feel very confident about the ZeroG arm and now we're seeing a growing receptiveness for other customers and I think that gives us the confidence to say we're going to be in regular commercialization not pilot or introductory phase.
And on the vest side we have already gone through one I think significant cycle in the development of that product. We were asked to help to innovate an area that was a big safety risk in productivity risk for an automotive manufacturer, we developed a first vest that way and since then we've reduced the weight by a third. We've made it more comfortable for the user to wear for long periods without sacrificing the support that it provides the arms for these tools underneath when they work underneath the car in the assembly plant. We've done that and we've also reduced the cost in the next generation. So we've actually started to pilot it in our beta phase it's just underway and we think that in Q3 this is really where we're going to start to take some significant orders for that device.
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Tom Looby for closing remarks.
Thomas Looby
I think I just simply like to thank you for taking the time to join the call today and the please have a great evening.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Miss. Debbie Kaster. Thank you, Ms. Kaster, you may begin.
Debbie Kaster
Thank you, Tim, and thank you all for participating in today’s call. Joining me from Ekso Bionics are Thomas Looby, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Max Scheder-Bieschin, Chief Financial Officer. Earlier today, Ekso Bionics released financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. A copy of the press release is available on the Company’s website.

This conference call contains time-sensitive information and is accurate only as of the live broadcast today, March 7, 2016.
I will now turn the call over to Thomas Looby. Tom.
Thomas Looby
Thank you, Debbie, and thanks everyone for dialing into our call this afternoon. We are pleased to report the results of one of our best years ever at Ekso Bionics. 2016 was a pivotal year for our Company during which Ekso Bionics initiated a transformation from a development stage organization to a commercial entity.
Driven by the goals that our team set to ourselves we succeeded in achieving the followings. In April, we received FDA clearance allowing us to market our devices for patients with spinal cord injuries as well as for patients who have suffered a stroke. This gave us the widest label of any exoskeleton on the market in the U.S.
Upon our clearance we kicked off our go-to-market efforts with the goal of first driving awareness that our device can help the hundreds and thousands of stroke suffers and then targeting the clinics with the greatest need. Recall that before 2016 no Company was allowed to market a Class 2 device for use to stroke patients. It is our single responsibility to do that now.
During the second half of the year, we initiated and began enrollment in our first Company sponsored study the WISE study to help support the adoption of our technology as standard-of-care. In August, we concurrently finance the Company and uplifted our stock from the OTC to the Nasdaq Capital Market. Providing us with cash to commercialize our products as well as giving us access to a broader range of investors and increased liquidity.

With our approval in hand, Ekso Bionics is now able to promote our products at medical conferences around the world participating in over 30 events in the U.S. and EMEA since our clearance. And our users have taken over 70 million steps on the way to better recoveries with this rehab tool. All of these accomplishments which have now set the groundwork for the growth we expect in 2017 and beyond culminated in the strong results in the fourth quarter of 2016.
A few financial performance headlines, our medical device business had one of its best quarter ever with $1.8 million in sales, we are seeing particular strength in North America markets and I'm optimistic that the changes we have put in place in our EMEA organization in 2016 will set Europe on the path to catch up to North America during 2017.
Our industrial business continues to gain traction with its fourth quarter of growth and now over 140 units in the field. We recognized the sale of 16 Ekso GT units including the conversion of two units from rentals, expanding the installed base to over 200 medical devices at over 160 customers. In January, we announced a long-term loan agreement for up to $10 million, which provides capital on attractive terms to help support our continued growth as a Company.
With the transition from development staged, commercial entity, for me the next step is converting the large market opportunities into shareholder value driven by top-line growth as our products become standard within their industries. We are focused on proving that our business is sustainable by helping our customers cost effectively achieve great results in both the medical and industrial markets. Our strong value proposition and customer services will further strengthen our brand in this early market.
During 2016 we made significant progress with our clinical program, which we believe will provide us with that data and experience we need to move towards standard-of-care. As mentioned earlier, in the fall we kicked of our first companies sponsored study, the WISE study, which stands for Walking Improvement for Spinal cord Injury with Exoskeleton. WISE is being lead by Burke Rehabilitation Institute and is evaluating improvement and independent gait speeds of incomplete spinal cord injury patients, undergoing rehabilitation with the Ekso GT.
The U.S. based study is being conducted and at least eight centers and seeks to enroll approximately 160 communities dwelling people with chronic, incomplete spinal cord injury. Our WISE study is complemented by 46 ongoing and completed external studies, which together cover over 1000 patients and a U.S. based exoskeleton registry, in which we plan to participate.
Thus far these studies have concluded some great findings for Ekso GT, first the Ekso GT is safe and feasible for use for gait training in stroke and spinal cord injury. Participants have demonstrated the possibility of walking longer distances without fatigue, while obtaining the physiological benefits and improved circulation.
Training in Ekso GT has been shown to improve gait speed and parameters like endurance, balance, midline alignment and motor control during walking both inside the device, but also and may be even more importantly outside of the device. Training in Ekso GT may lessen affect of secondary complications and may improve lower extremity strength, body composition, bowel and bladder function and psychological well being.
Our researchers continue to work with our team and their patients to further personalize rehabilitation with our Ekso GT as we drive towards standard-of-care. In addition to this growing body of clinical evidence, we continue to hear from customers regarding the compelling financial returns they are realizing from our products.

As many of heard during our Investor Day in December, one of our customer shared how they have achieved an internal rate of return of over 50% from their Ekso devices. We are hearing this more-and-more as evidence by the fact that almost 30% of our customers are buying multiple units. To support our transition to full commercialization, our team spent significant time and energy building our operational infrastructure.
As a reminder, before we received our FDA clearance in April, which impacted our ability to communicate through such avenues as industry conferences or even written and printed marketing materials. With FDA clearance in hand, our team is able to fully promote and market our Ekso GT to now hone in on the 16,000 hospitals that are best served by our products.
As such, we have raised money to fund the next phase of growth for the Company and have appropriately added resources to our team to target these customers for awareness as well as product education and demos.
The awareness campaign for Ekso is now incredibly wide spread through such outlets as industry conferences, media outreach, customer marketing campaigns and social media. We are excited about our newly initiated Centers of Excellence Peer-to-Peer program. Through this program existing high utilization customers, sign on to assist with clinical evidence generation, product development and to help educate new and potential customers on the benefits of using our devices. As additional validation many of our customers have released videos documenting their own use of our products and are actively promoting their experiences with the Ekso GT to the public.
Consistent with broader healthcare industry trends we are really excited to be moving our technology platform in the direction of personalized care, and believe the Ekso brand will offer helpful tools for the global move to value based healthcare. We announced the first shipment of our Ekso GT with SmartAssist technology in Europe in September and launched this technology in the U.S. this past month.
SmartAssist allows physical therapist to vary the support of the device for each leg independently from full power to free walking and thereby meet the specific needs of these patients. Already 26 devices or more than 160 customers have upgraded to this important software enhancement.
We also recently announced the re-launch of our significantly upgraded EksoPulse to technology platform. EksoPulse allows physical therapist to not only capture patient progress during sessions but to safely store the therapeutic data in a cloud-based system to synchronize that data with cellular technology in order to track changes in patients performance and to then make real time adjustments to the care plans.
Turning to the EksoWorks industrial business our business is really beginning to gain meaningful attraction with strategic customers. We shipped 58 industrial units in the fourth quarter of 2016 an increase of 29% from just the quarter before. In the second quarter launched the Ekso 0G product and also partnered with the major rental Company that gives us further access to the industrial and construction markets for product placement.
EksoWorks 2 has turned a corner from a development into a viable commercial business and a strong contributor to the overall Ekso Bionics story. In order to support and promote the growth of EksoWorks we ramped up our investment into infrastructure that is dedicated to the industrial business.
During the second half of 2016 in addition to focus R&D efforts refining our mounted RM systems and pre-commercialization of our soon to be launched best systems, we refine our positioning and execution with key customers including distributors picked up from our Equipois acquisitions and initiated a launch with the network of manufactures representatives to expand our rentals and sales distribution network.

A very exciting milestone for us this January was our attendance at first industrial trade show the World of Concrete which was a sort of coming out parties for EksoWorks within the industry. The trade show as a huge success in the number of leads from the conference far surpassed our expectations.
There are four main benefits of our products for the industrial workplace; increased productivity with less fatigue, improved safety, better quality of workmanship and the ability to attract a wider range of employees for these jobs. A case in point some of our customers are reporting a two to five times increasing productivity, improving the bottom line for these customers. I’m excited that our value proposition is taking hold among customers and users.
And finally, in the fall of 2016, we started to realign our EMEA organization. In September, Matthias Stief, who I worked with at Given Imaging joined Ekso's management team to run our European operations. With the EMEA markets being as large as the U.S. market we needed to make sure we have the infrastructure in place to serve patients in EMEA as well. Under Matthias' leadership the Ekso GT was recently subject to a Medtech Innovation Briefing released by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence known by its acronym NICE.
The MIB highlights the innovative aspect of Ekso Bionics' proprietary SmartAssist software, which differentiates the Ekso GT from other available wearable exoskeletons. MIBs compliment existing NICE guidance by providing objective information on new and novel medical technologies and are used as an aid to local decision making by clinicians. We are honored to have been the subject of this MIB.
During the first as the CEO of Ekso Bionics' I have been truly humbled by the team. All of the accomplishments outlined above continue to reinforce my confidence that we are building something great here and I'm excited to lead us into the future.
At this time, I will hand the call to Max, our CFO to talk about our detailed financial results for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2016.
Max Scheder-Bieschin
Thanks, Tom. Now to some financial highlights, please see our accompanying earnings release and 10-K for further details regarding the quarter and full-year 2016.
Total reported revenue for Q4, 2016 was $2.6 million up from $1.9 million in Q4, 2015. The breakdown for Q4, 2016 revenues is as follows. Approximately $1.8 million in medical device and related revenue, this is up 56% over Q4, 2015. During the fourth quarter we again experienced strong second unit buyers. We continue to be excited to see this validation by early users of the value proposition of the Ekso GT.
Approximately 600,000 in EksoWorks revenue up from nothing the same period a year ago, approximately 300,000 in EksoLabs down from 800,000 in Q4 of 2015. Remember at the beginning of 2016, we made the strategic decision to shift the focus of our labs’ engineering team to our industrial business a next generation home mobility device.
Overall for the year, 2016 revenues were $14.2 million; please note that this includes $6.5 million of previously differed revenue recognized in Q1. Our overall gross profit for the quarter was 843,000 for gross margin of 32.6%, this compares to a gross loss of 10% in Q4 of 2015.
The gross margin for our medical business in Q4 was 30.5%, a continued improvement over prior quarters as we scale among other areas our after sales service. Gross margin for industrial business in Q4 was 27.7% and for engineering services unit 58%. Note that the lateral reflects an annual royalty payment in Q4 from our strategic license with Ottobock.
Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $7.5 million as compared to $6.5 million for the fourth quarter 2015. The increase was driven by the increased sales, clinical and marketing investments we are making since our April clearance, and the increased R&D investment, to support our industrial and next generation home mobility products.

Net loss for the quarter was $5.6 million, as compared to a $4.6 million net loss in Q4. Net loss applicable to common shareholders for the year was $33.8 million, note that this includes a $10.3 million in non-cash preferred deemed dividend expense associated with our December 2015 financing.
Given that all, the preferred shareholders have converted the preferred shares we do not foresee any further non-cash preferred deemed dividend expenses for 2017. Cash used in operating activities for the quarter was $4.4 million. As of December 31, 2016, we have cash balance of $16.8 million.
Some additional notes of important for the fourth quarter for our rehab business we hit our target for demos, which is for us a key indicator for sales traction later this year and into 2018. In EksoWorks at year end we had reached over 140 units in the field, 40% of which were sold in the fourth quarter and the pipeline is strong with the leads from our first two trade shows this year.
We saw continued improvement in our gross margins across the business with 2016 margins up 50% over 2015 gross margins. And we decreased inventory levels by close to 20% from 1.9 million at the end of September, as we gain better visibility into our pipeline for both EksoHealth and EksoWorks.
We are more confident than ever that the market opportunity for our devices in rehabilitation is compelling and sizable. There are an estimated 16,000 centers in United States and 50,000 worldwide. Based on the execution of our marketing strategy, combined with the success with early customers, we are targeting a run rate of 30 Ekso GT units per quarter by year end 2017. This would be up from the 11 units we have recognized in Q2, 2016, before we had an FDA label.
On the industrial side, we see a similarly compelling and sizable opportunity. Given our Q4 run rate and order in place, we are optimistic that we will at least double sales in 2017 from the 1.2 million we hit in 2016. While there will be changes quarter-over-quarter due to mix, we expect overall gross margins to remain stable for the year in 2017 that is in the 25% to 30% range we achieved over the last two quarters.
Our ultimate goal as we get to standard-of-care is to achieve gross margins in north of 50%. Subject to our hitting our internal sales goals, we see our investment in sales and marketing increasing 20% in this current Q1 over Q4 2016 and then holding relatively flat for the rest of 2017. We expect R&D expenses to increase 10% in Q1 over Q4 with another increase in the second half as we get closer to some new products introductions.
With that, I will turn the call back to Tom.
Thomas Looby
Thanks Max. As we have discussed in the past a broader theme to our strategy at Ekso is to be very deliberate moving into our markets. We are pleased with the results we are seeing thus far which confirm to us that our strategy is to right one. We believe that this approach will lead to great success across all of the businesses and markets at Ekso Bionics.
Looking ahead to our future, we are making great progress on the development of our revolutionary home mobility platform, which leverages the exceptional safety, sophistication and efficacy of our flagship Ekso GT. The team is hitting their product development goals and is on-track for a go-to-market date for an novel home mobility product in Europe in 2018 and the U.S. in 2019.
On the industrial side, we are building this business with the strategy similar to how we have approached the medical business by laying down the fundamental cornerstones in the thoughtful methodical way as we build the infrastructure around EksoWorks. We are continuously learning more about the market for these products uncovering many drivers of adoption as well as unmet customer needs that we hope to address.

We are currently hard at work on our next product offering our EksoBest, a wearable exoskeleton help with overhead work. The first grade team here at Ekso Bionics is focused on accelerating market adoption of our products with the goal of ultimately establishing Ekso Bionics as standard-of-care. As we look back and review the year I’m pleased with what we have accomplished and I’m confident that we are set up to achieve our longer-term goals.
Some of our strategic objectives for the upcoming year include the following; Drive market development globally for our medical devices through clinical evidence and a strong marketing program. Continue to move forward on the development of the home used product. Continue to collect data that supports the financial benefits of using our products and promote business development and the industrial segment.
I’m incredibly energized by our business and excited for the year ahead. We are proving that we can execute and continually move our Company to the next level and we are more confident than ever that we have the best strategy and the right team to achieve our goals of being the premiere exoskeleton Company in the world.
With that, I will end our prepared remarks and look forward to your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Imron Zafar of Suntrust. Please proceed with your question.
Imron Zafar
Hi good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question I wanted to first ask a couple of questions on your outlook for 2017. Could you just sort of talk about how we should we think about the cadence I know you talked about the run rate at the end of the year, but just looking at your year backlog and the sales cycle you probably have some pretty good visibility on the next couple of quarters. If you could just sort of describe how you are thinking about the cadence for the year that would be helpful? Thanks.
Max Scheder-Bieschin
Thanks, Imron. This is Max. So for the beginning of last year 2016 as we averaged between Q1 and Q3 and average the cash burn about 6.8 million a quarter and then for the fourth quarter last year we averaged about 4.4 million. I think going forward for the year that's very much how we will be managing our business in that bandwidth. I think from a gross margin standpoint, we expect to be holding the margins we have recognized or realized in the last two quarters. So between those two items, I think that’s how we will be managing our operating expenses as well.
Imron Zafar
Okay, why would the gross margin not trend higher as you increase your unit volumes over the course of the year?
Max Scheder-Bieschin
Primarily because of the mix in 2016, we had unfortunately we had a fewer sales coming out of Europe, that’s why Tom made the shift he did. Typically it’s the 50%, 50% between Europe and United States and a lot of our sales in Europe are distributor sales, they have a lower ASP and so the ASP's that we have had sort of in the fourth quarter, we don’t expect those to remain the same, because we expect more business out of Europe and with that more distributor sales.
So you are right we expect to improve on the service side of the business, we have gone from a very deep loss to less of a loss, enhance the improvement in the margins and that we expect to continue but with average sales price is dropping a little bit that’s why we sort of come out at the same levels, for at least the next couple of quarters.
Imron Zafar
Got you, in terms of the your sort of the comparative landscape and sort of customer interest, has there any change in the comparative landscape in terms of rehab center, purchases and also have you noticed any near-term change in patterns just in light of the uncertainty around the ACA and what administration might be with healthcare.

Thomas Looby
First and for most competitively we don’t see many changes, we are still the only one with stroke on our label, we are still very good tractions in the clinics that have now become aware of exoskeletons and then become aware of exoskeleton with stroke. I would say that biggest trend that I see is that the utilization is up.
Quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year the utilization that we our smart devices that send that of the cloud is that, we are not just selling units but the units are being used and being used in the accelerator rate. But we think that this is another indicator that we will have more traction in the future. It's up by the way 20% quarter-over-quarter, Q4 over Q3 20% that’s the nice trend I think.
Imron Zafar
Sure thank you, and then my last question is about the military construction in VA appropriations budget for fiscal 2017, obviously the language in there was very strong into our spend of medical exoskeletons. Can you just talk about what the implications are for the Company, I mean have you seen any impacts thus far in terms of potential grants from the VA or also sort of the longer term implications for the Company in terms of support from VA?
Max Scheder-Bieschin
Sure first of all the VA remains our biggest customer overall and we get 24 units at 11 sites around the U.S. The build that you refer to is it takes some time to cook in DC. And so I think they are due for a plan for the center of excellence by midyear 2017, but as of yet, we are the only robotic exoskeleton Company, who is value proposition comes into focus as contemplated by that build. So we are actually optimistic of what it will mean once they publish that plan.
Imron Zafar
Okay. Thank you very much.
Max Scheder-Bieschin
Thank you Imron.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Greg Chodaczek [B. Riley]. Please proceed with your question.
Greg Chodaczek
Thanks. Just a couple of here, Tom out of the 1600 center in the U.S., how many of those do you think can justify an excellent skeleton right now?
Thomas Looby
You know Greg, we have a very rich data about these 16000 centers, not just who they are and where they are but also how many patients go through them. At relatively small organization we have to be focused on them, what we did is we organically does filed these put them groups of ten, from the very busiest to the least busy. And as a business we are focusing on the top four, that’s the way that we are prospecting doing the inside sales calls, then refining them for quality demonstrations and then bringing them to close.
But when we also look at the data, we see that we have sales to each one of those ten deciles from the very busiest to they are not so busy and some of the ones in a lower deciles have made a second order, so we know that our value preposition resonates to every single one of those levels it's just that as a business we want to be smart by taking it from the top down.
Greg Chodaczek
And with the changing label that you have for a while has that changed the sales cycle in terms of time from first looking at one to signing a purchase order?
Thomas Looby
I think it has accelerate a little we have some data that suggest that but keep in mind exoskeleton is not something that everybody knows about yet either, and then when you would think about exoskeletons most times people think about spinal cord injury and so we have to educate them about stroke and then you facture in that it has been a relatively long sales cycles.
All of those things we are very focused on accelerating each step in that phase of the sales cycle from general awareness to the demo to convincing the leaders or the decision makers at the clinics to make him that close. So we use sales automation and we are tracking sort of those gaits in between in each step and making sure that we know where to accelerate and I think that over the next few quarters we will see a shortening of that lead time of that sales cycle.

Greg Chodaczek
Okay, and the SmartAssist software the update. What percentage of the systems is out there have SmartAssist?
Max Scheder-Bieschin
I think its 26 units is what we just said out of the 200 plus, so call it about 10% to 15% and it's growing. Some of those units the recent ones the SmartAssist software is encompassed in the purchase price that ASPs for the units that have been for the technology that has been purchased separately is about I believe it's $4,200 a unit.
Greg Chodaczek
Okay, and do all the units out there are they capable of SmartAssist?
Max Scheder-Bieschin
All the unit are capable of SmartAssist, I can't tell you we don’t know how many will convert to SmartAssist that will be a approx. But it gives the sales team another touch point to go and talk to customers and understand them better as well.
Greg Chodaczek
Okay, and last but not least regarding the home use products, can you talk about what you are trying to do with that, what it could be what it may not be or is this more skunk works and we will talk about it later?
Thomas Looby
Great question, Greg, first of all just to elaborate a little bit on what Max said and I know you didn’t ask the question but anecdotally the centers where we have installed SmartAssist have been thrilled by what it does. So when you dream of something, then design it, then get it cleared and then release it, you always have a hope that it's going to have a good reception to marketplace and we are seeing that right now.
So with home mobility we have said for a while that we are going to build this brand by winning the hearts and minds of the rehab clinics establishing the brand of exoskeleton and Ekso Bionics, but we lookout and for home mobility and it's a big price.
Right, but In order to do this we need to have the devices be capable and capable for different disease states and injuries have it be really safe we have got a very safe product in the Ekso GT and we want to make sure that we bring this reputation into the home and making it cost effective.
So what our teams are doing is we are looking at many technology vectors, so think about all-day wear ability and battery life and how to package the device so that it is less intrusive than what the rehab devices are and so on and then making that applicable for the different disease states.
So but this is not just skunk works we have really constrained the design question to how do we do this as rapidly as possible by achieving cost affectivity and safety. So that's why we are very optimistic that 2018 will release something in Europe and 2019 we will do so in the United States for the first product.
Greg Chodaczek
Perfect. And I just have one more question I apologize everybody else is also on the line. When it comes to useful life of an Ekso GT out there right now how long is it?
Max Scheder-Bieschin
They have been designed for 1.2 million steps and so our estimate is somewhere in the three to four year range.
Greg Chodaczek
All right. Thank you Max.
Max Scheder-Bieschin
Okay. Thanks.
Thomas Looby
Greg, thank you.
