  Dedicated to local

 
  
  
  and global communities

 
since 1935

Our firm was founded with commitment to community as our guiding principle. And we’ve been making a difference ever since.












































1935
Laying The Foundation

Morgan Stanley formally opens its doors for business at 2 Wall Street, New York City, on September 16, 1935. In its first year,  the firm handles $1.1 billion in public offerings and private placements—a 24 percent market share.



1940
Caring for Children

Founding partner Harold Stanley establishes the firm’s commitment to children’s health by raising $1.5 million (equal to nearly $25 million in 2014) for the US Committee for the Care of European Children.



1941-1942
Reorganizing and Expanding

The firm undergoes a reorganization as a partnership to allow for rapidly expanding activity in the securities business. The following year, Morgan Stanley joins the New York Stock Exchange.



1952
Rebuilding Countries

As Europe struggles to recover after World War II, Morgan Stanley co-manages the World Bank’s $50 million bond offering to help finance European reconstruction efforts.



1961-1969
Stronger Starts

The Morgan Stanley Foundation launches in 1961. The following year, Morgan Stanley develops the first computer model for financial analysts. In 1967, the firm establishes Morgan & Cie International in Paris to pursue the growing European securities market.



1970-1979
Increased Capabilities

Morgan Stanley becomes the first international investment bank to establish a representative office in Tokyo, Japan, in 1970. In the following years, the Sales and Trading, Research, Investment Management, Realty and Private Wealth Management departments launch.



1980-1989
Going Public

Morgan Stanley develops TAPS – the first automated trade processing system – in 1984, with the Fixed Income Division launching the following year. In 1986, the firm goes public to raise capital for further growth. Over the course of the decade, the firm opens offices in Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Melbourne, Milan, Sydney and Zurich, as well as expanding in London and Tokyo.



1990-1999
Global Impact

In 1995, Morgan Stanley enters China as a cornerstone investor in China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and establishes the Morgan Stanley International Foundation. The 1997 merger of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Dean, Witter, Discover & Co. creates the world’s largest securities firm to date. Over the course of the decade, the firm expands further in Asia and Latin America.



2000-2007
Community Commitment

In addition to handling some of the largest tech IPOs, security offerings and acquisitions in the world, Morgan Stanley stands firm behind its commitments to community—from a joint effort by the firm and its employees to raise $60 million to build Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, to employee-led relief efforts following the September 11 terrorist attacks.



2008-2013
Transitions and Strategic Alliances

In 2008, Morgan Stanley becomes a bank holding company and forms a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). Morgan Stanley completes the purchase of the Morgan Stanley Wealth Management joint venture in 2013, becoming 100% owner of one of the world’s leading wealth management franchises.



2013-2014
Dedication to Sustainability

The firm looks to the future by launching the Investing with Impact platform and the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing-a pair of initiatives dedicated to inspiring positive social impact and fostering large-scale global sustainability.

The Hong Kong stock exchange has rejected the IPO application of AMTD Strategic Capital Group [IPO-AMTD.HK], a corporate insurance broker backed by Morgan Stanley‘s private equity arm.
It becomes only the sixth company to fall foul of Hong Kong stock listing regulations in nearly four years.
The Hong Kong company, controlled by AMTD Asia, filed in May for the IPO, which Thomson Reuters publication IFR said could total $200 million.
The application was rejected on June 5, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange decision dated July 21.
Hong Kong introduced stricter listing rules in 2014 to improve the quality of listings but the exchange did not say why it had rejected AMTD’s application.
AMTD Strategic Capital is 79 percent owned by AMTD Asia, which in turn is owned by Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia (MSPEA), asset management firm L.R. Capital Group and China Minsheng Investment Corp, China’s largest privately owned investment company.
China Everbright Capital Ltd and China Merchants Securities had been hired as joint sponsors of the IPO, according to the IPO prospectus.
Under Hong Kong’s tightened rules, the regulator names IPO sponsors and issuers whose applications are incomplete and bans them from refiling the documents for eight weeks.
Banks are also criminally liable if an IPO prospectus is found to have misled investors.
AMTD Strategic Capital has raised $34 million this year alone in funds for business expansion, from seven investors, according its IPO prospectus. They included Morgan Stanley’s private equity arm, an investment holding company linked to the co-founder of Meitu Inc (1357.HK), an affiliate of Sohu.com Inc (SOHU.O) and real estate development firm Indochina Capital.

By Elzio Barreto
HONG KONG, July 24 (Reuters) - The Hong Kong stock exchange
has rejected the IPO application of AMTD Strategic Capital Group
, a corporate insurance broker backed by Morgan
Stanley's private equity arm.
It becomes only the sixth company to fall foul of Hong Kong
stock listing regulations in nearly four years.
The Hong Kong company, controlled by AMTD Asia, filed in May
for the IPO, which Thomson Reuters publication IFR said could
total $200 million.
The application was rejected on June 5, according to a Hong
Kong stock exchange decision dated July 21.
Hong Kong introduced stricter listing rules in 2014 to
improve the quality of listings but the exchange did not say why
it had rejected AMTD's application.
AMTD Strategic Capital is 79 percent owned by AMTD Asia,
which in turn is owned by Morgan Stanley Private Equity Asia
(MSPEA), asset management firm L.R. Capital Group and China
Minsheng Investment Corp, China's largest privately owned
investment company.
China Everbright Capital Ltd and China Merchants Securities
had been hired as joint sponsors of the IPO, according to the
IPO prospectus.
Under Hong Kong's tightened rules, the regulator names IPO
sponsors and issuers whose applications are incomplete and bans
them from refiling the documents for eight weeks.
Banks are also criminally liable if an IPO prospectus is
found to have misled investors.
AMTD Strategic Capital has raised $34 million this year
alone in funds for business expansion, from seven investors,
according its IPO prospectus. They included Morgan Stanley's
private equity arm, an investment holding company linked to the
co-founder of Meitu Inc, an affiliate of Sohu.com Inc
and real estate development firm Indochina Capital.

Most of the eight to 10 members of the principal strategic investments group have left the Wall Street firm in the last few months, including head Gary Offner, the people said.  A Morgan Stanley spokesman declined to comment.  The move comes as Morgan Stanley, like its Wall Street peers, is looking to cut costs amid pressure on its bottom line.  It also comes as the group shifts its strategy to focus more on the investments' strategic fit to the bank's sales and trading operations, rather than one that just looks at returns, one of the people said.   The business will continue to exist with a smaller headcount and the bank is not retreating from investing in financial technology, the people added.  The principal strategic investment group invests in market structure ventures and financial technology that align with the bank's equities division. It has held stakes in companies including Philadelphia Stock Exchange, BATS Global Markets, Chi-X Global and bank messaging company Symphony Communications.  Morgan Stanley's equities division, which this week named  Peter Santoro as its global head of trading, remains a bright spot for the bank.  The business, which competes head-to-head with rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), generated revenue of $8.1 billion in 2015, excluding adjustments, up 18 percent from the year prior.  A separate Morgan Stanley group based in London makes investments on behalf of fixed income. It is unclear if this group was impacted by the cuts. Other banks including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup (C.N) and Credit Suisse AG MLPN.P have teams that make bets on the future of financial technology.
