 CARING PROFESSIONAL / STRONG NEGOTIATOR  The purchase or sale of your home is a deeply personal and emotional experience and an important business transaction. Today more than ever, your home is not only where you and your family live, work and play, but is a valuable asset and a key component of your future retirement. That is why when you decide to sell or purchase a home you need the help of a true professional REALTOR® who understands the factors that affect the value of a home and is able to be a strong advocate in looking out for your best interests. In the Preamble to the REALTOR® Code of Ethics there is a paragraph which I take very seriously: “The term REALTOR® has come to connote competency, fairness, and high integrity resulting from adherence to a lofty ideal of moral conduct in business relations. No inducement of profit and no instruction from clients ever can justify departure from this ideal.” I approach my relationship with my clients quite simply. I adhere to a guide which has been handed down through the centuries, embodied in the Golden Rule, “Whatsoever ye would that others should do to you, do ye even so to them.”    TESTIMONIALS  “What I think sums the relationship that flourished between Nestor and us over just a short few weeks is “trust.” …Nestor has a keen ability to mold his approach to the customer’s style and is a reliable negotiator that will go to bat for his customer, whilst maximizing the chances for a successful closure where his negotiation skill and tactics really come alive… We have a house we love, in a location that we could never have dreamt of, and at a good value…” — E. Hughes "Nestor Rivera is an exceptional Realtor in the Atlanta metro area. He knows this city so very well and brought my wife and I great peace of mind as we relocated to this entirely new metroplex. We really enjoyed working with him, but even more importantly he obtained a beautiful house for us, and consistently went the extra mile or more to help us. I give my absolute highest recommendation." — P. Carello "Nestor has helped me buy 2 houses and sell one, he has always put my family’s needs and interests as a top priority. I would recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell in the Atlanta area." — E. Garcia "Nestor provided my wife and I with an unparalleled level of customer service and integrity during the purchase of our first home. This was especially reassuring given that we were engaging in this process from outside of the state, so having him by-our-side was a tremendous asset. He was an absolute fount of information about the Atlanta real estate market, the home buying process, contractors, inspections, the Atlanta community, and everything in between. We are happy to say that, largely because of Nestor's willingness to work on our behalf, we were able to find our dream home at a great price. I strongly recommend Nestor to anyone who is thinking about buying a home; he is a true advocate and a wonderful human being!" — Dr. R. Meyer "I could not have asked for a more knowledgeable and trustworthy realtor to help me through the purchasing of my first home. He presented me with numerous options and quickly honed in on exactly what I was looking for. He explained every step of the buying process in language I could understand; and even when I felt I had gotten the best deal possible, he worked hard to make that deal even sweeter. I definitely recommend Nestor to anyone looking to purchase a new home in the Atlanta area." — M.
