As demand for electricity surges, so does the pressure on companies to reduce their energy costs and on utilities to respond to capacity or reserve shortfalls. All this pressure leads to us delivering Demand Response programs that benefit customers and utilities in measurable ways.

Reliable Solutions
Our programs allow you to reduce your usage without impairing your critical day to day business operations. Learn how below.
The Proof is in Our ProcessWhile every demand response program we deliver is uniquely suited to the needs of our customers, the hallmarks of our overall approach can be summarized in this typical sequence of events:

Knowledge – Each customer receives a meter or device upgrade to track electricity use in real-time. This gives us access to your interval data, while allowing you to view your interval demands and kWh usage for improved energy management.
Strategy – Based on your energy consumption patterns and daily business operations, we can develop a real-world reduction strategy – one that is based on employee knowledge of Demand Response procedures.
Communication – In the event of an electric grid crisis or predicted supply shortage, the grid operator or utility will alert us of the need for emergency demand response action.
Action – Your designated event contact will be notified and will begin implementation of the prescribed reduction strategy.
Measurement – Your performance is determined by your reduction of electric demand from a previously calculated baseline. In some markets, reduction is measured against demand from the prior year’s peak hours. In others, it may be measured against a demand average from recent weeks, days or even hours.
Reward – At the conclusion of the demand response season, you receive payments based on the total kW reduction your company achieved during the designated time periods.

Contact Us TodayTo learn more about custom-built Demand Response solutions for your business.
Learn MoreCurtailment TipsOur customers use a wide variety of tactics to reduce their energy usage. Below are a few quick and easy ways to reduce your watts:

Generators – Make sure generators are fully fueled and connected to as much load as practical.
Equipment – Determine which processes can be shut down for 1-4 hours during an event. Make sure equipment operators are aware of what to do when an event takes place.
Elevators – Take some elevators off duty. Have “out of service” signs ready to place on every floor.
Chillers – Investigate options for running chillers at reduced capacity. These vary to fit your facility’s needs.
Lights – Identify all areas where lighting can be safely reduced. Label switches that are to be turned off during events.
Thermostat – Raise your thermostat six degrees during an event.

 Home  |  Utilities
UtilitiesWe design, develop and implement
custom-created Demand Response programs
for utilities across North America, taking into account
the specific needs of each territory.
The Power to DeliverOutside of developing Demand Response programs that work for energy intensive companies, we also work directly with utilities to offer programs that appeal to end-users, regulators and stakeholders alike.
Our 5-Phase Approach balances the interests of both utilities and end-users, resulting in a program that works for everyone:

Program Design/Consulting → This is where we customize the framework of the program, including performance measurements, payment structures, event triggers, hours and notification, compensation/revenue allocation and settlement processes.
Marketing and Enrollment → This area involves the identification of prospects, branding, creation and distribution of necessary materials, staff training, enrollment/certification requirements, affiliate relationships and seminars/webinars.
Pre-Event Assessment and Readiness → In our experience, preparedness is key to success. Here, that includes three main areas: Metering Platform Deployment, Demand Response Audits/Site Surveys and Reduction Action Plans.
Event Activations → To ensure success in a reduction event, two areas take hold: Automated client notification and resource interaction. Customer outreach and communication is conducted in real-time to ensure our portfolio is performing at full capacity.
Post-Event Analysis and Communication → Once a reduction event is over, this step begins and involves data reconciliation and performance analysis.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 11/18/2004
            

                BBB has determined that NRG Curtailment Solutions, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed.

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Business Profile














BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
