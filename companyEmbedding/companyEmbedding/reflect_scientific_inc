Tweet








10/1/2014 10:03:06 AM


OREM, UT--(Marketwired - September 30, 2014) -  Highlighted Links Cryometrix Reflect Scientific Inc Reflect Scientific, Inc. (OTCBB: RSCF), a provider of diverse products and services for the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and transportation industries announced the introduction of the Cryometrix S-135 low temperature shipper for the Biotech and Pharmaceutical industries. 

An outgrowth of the patented T-150 Ultra Low Temperature (ULT) freezer technology the S-135 shipper provides a simple solution to shipping larger quantities of temperature sensitive products to facilities for further processing or to a final product distribution point. The S-135 is a stand-alone shipper that can maintain a temperature down to -135C for up to 6 days and has a fully usable capacity of 21.25 cubic feet. Multiple shippers can easily be placed together in a trailer for increased capacity. Boyd Bowdish, Principal Scientist at Reflect Scientific commented, "Our market research indicated a need for this product in the shipping market. The product we came up with fills this niche nicely using a simple building block approach allowing a customer to easily tailor the shipping capacity."

The S-135 uses liquid nitrogen as a coolant, no compressors and few moving parts. Liquid nitrogen does not contact any stored products. High reliability, uniform temperature distribution within the compartment and simple operation make the S-135 an ideal shipping container for thermally sensitive pharmaceuticals or biotechnology products. For more information go to www.cryometrix.com.
