DISCLAIMER.  THE API IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS-IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.  SICKWEATHER MAY MAKE MODIFICATIONS AND/OR CHANGES IN THE API AT ANY TIME AND FOR ANY REASON.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, SICKWEATHER expressly disclaims all OTHER warranties, either express or implied, including, WITHOUT LIMITATION, any warranties OF INTERFERENCE WITH ENJOYMENT OF INFORMATION, NON-INFRINGEMENT, merchantability, QUALITY, ACCURACY, OR fitness for a particular purpose.  MOREOVER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SICKWEATHER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE API WILL OPERATE ERROR-FREE OR IN AN UNINTERRUPTED MANNER.
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  YOU acknowledge and agree that Sickweather shall not be liable or responsible for any claim, damage, or loss resulting from a cause beyond Sickweather's control.  Sickweather also assumes no responsibility for YOUR FAilure to comply with any applicable law or regulation or for the deletion of or failure to store any content or information.  IN ADDITION, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT Sickweather will not be liable to YOU, or anyone claiming under or through YOU, for any indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOSS OF BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR INFORMATION), regardless of whether Sickweather was advised of the possibility of such damages.  The ENTIRE liability of Sickweather for any claim arising out of or in connection with the Agreement shall not exceed that amount paid to Sickweather FOR USE OF THE API WITHIN THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS OF THE date on which such claim is made.
GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement has been made in and will be construed and enforced solely in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland, U.S.A., as applied to agreements entered into and completely performed in the State of Maryland.  The state or local courts in the State of Maryland will have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over all controversies in connection with this Agreement, and You hereby consent to such exclusive and personal jurisdiction and venue.

You also acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this Agreement by You may cause irreparable injury to Sickweather and/or its licensors, such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and Sickweather and/or its licensors would not have an adequate remedy at law.  You therefore agree that Sickweather and/or its licensors (or on their behalf) shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of your obligations under any provision of this Agreement.  Accordingly, You hereby waive any requirement that Sickweather or its licensors post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to Sickweather to enforce any provision of this Agreement.
TERM AND TERMINATION.

This Agreement will terminate automatically if You click "I REJECT".  Sickweather also reserves the right at any time to terminate this agreement upon providing you notice thereof.  You may also terminate at any time by ceasing to use the API and providing Sickweather with notice of such termination.  But, all applicable provisions of this Agreement will survive termination, as outlined below.  In particular, any fees or charges that were due to Sickweather prior to termination or expiration shall remain and shall become immediately payable to Sickweather upon termination.  Upon termination or expiration, You must also delete the API and any associated materials in your control or possession.

      Description
    
Sickweather is the largest illness crowdsourcing community of its kind - processing over 6 million reports of illness each month!  As featured on the Today Show, Sickweather provides real-time alerts whenever you enter a 'sick zone'.  Be alerted for Flu, Norovirus, Pink Eye, Whooping Cough, and 19 other illnesses!"It's really great if you're a parent!" - The TODAY Show"I love this site!" - Queen Latifah"I think it’s a great idea! I love this!" - Meredith VieiraSickweather has also been honored among "100 Brilliant Companies" by Entrepreneur Magazine, "Top 5 Sites Crowdsourcing for Your Health" by George Washington University School of Public Health & Health Services, and has been recognized for identifying the peak week of flu season 15 weeks before the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC).With Sickweather Groups you can follow, report illnesses, and post messages directly to the locations that matter most to you, such as schools, workplaces, restaurants, hospitals and more! Add our SickScore® widget to your Today Screen to see the threat level of contagious illness in your immediate area.Unique to our Apple Watch app is a hand washing timer which runs for 20 seconds (as recommended by public health organizations) and uses Apple's Taptic Engine to let you know when you are done.Sickweather uses a patent-pending process to track and map reports of illness from social media in addition to crowdsourcing directly from our user community. Reports are represented by blue "SICK" map markers at the local level -- tap them for more information of exactly when they were reported. Some viruses can survive on surfaces for up to 48 hours and can have a viral life cycle of 2 weeks, so we color-code more recent reports as RED within 1 day, ORANGE within 2 days, YELLOW within 1 week, and we include reports as old as 2 weeks in BLUE.Note: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. Sickweather can be used with or without these services running, but to receive our real-time Sick Zone alerts, location services must be turned on.  You can discontinue GPS services by simply turning off our Alerts from within our app settings using the Master Switch.

Interesting!

          Shezebelle
        
        
      

    Especially for people with kids, where illness tends to spread like crazy — this is super helpful. Would prefer to be able to tag SCHOOL rather than present location or home, because that's where kid illnesses spread. But still: super interesting idea. If enough people adopt it, or if health clinics start sharing data, this could be super useful!
  



Nice app

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
