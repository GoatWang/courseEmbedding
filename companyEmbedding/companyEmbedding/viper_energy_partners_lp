Overview :: Viper Energy Partners LP (VNOM)








 














Home
About











Overview
We are a Delaware limited partnership formed to own, acquire and exploit oil and natural gas properties in North America. Our primary business objective is to provide an attractive return to unitholders by focusing on business results, maximizing distributions and pursuing accretive growth opportunities through acquisitions from Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) and from third parties. Our initial assets consist of mineral interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Permian Basin in West Texas, substantially all of which are leased to working interest owners who bear the costs of operation and development.
We expect our initial focus will concentrate on the Permian Basin, which is one of the oldest and most prolific producing basins in North America. The Permian Basin, which consists of approximately 85,000 square miles centered around Midland, Texas, has been a significant source of oil production since the 1920s. The Permian Basin is known to have a number of zones of oil and natural gas bearing rock throughout. However, because of the nature of the rock in many of the potentially productive zones, historically it was not economic to exploit these zones. As a result, exploration and development was limited until recently when higher oil prices and more advanced completion techniques, including hydraulic fracturing, changed the economics of drilling and development of these zones and greatly increased the oil and natural gas industry’s interest in the Permian Basin. Oil production in the Permian Basin has grown from 850,000 barrels per day in 2008 to 1.3 million barrels per day in 2013. Based on public statements made by a number of publicly traded oil and natural gas companies, and the successful horizontal well results of the industry, we believe that drilling activity in the Permian Basin is likely to continue to grow at least for several more years.

Home
Our Strategy
Overview










Overview
Our primary business objective is to provide an attractive return to unitholders by focusing on business results and total distributions and pursuing accretive growth opportunities through acquisitions from Diamondback and from third parties. We intend to accomplish this objective by executing the following strategies:

Seek to acquire from Diamondback, from time to time, mineral or other interests in producing oil and natural gas properties that meet our acquisition criteria. We may have additional opportunities to acquire producing oil and natural gas properties directly from Diamondback from time to time in the future. We believe Diamondback may be incentivized to sell properties to us, as doing so may enhance Diamondback’s economic returns by monetizing long-lived producing properties while potentially retaining a portion of the resulting cash flow through distributions on Diamondback’s limited partner interests in us.
Leverage our relationship with Diamondback to participate with it in acquisitions of third-party producing properties and to increase the size and scope of our potential third-party acquisition targets. Diamondback’s executives have long histories of evaluating, pursuing and consummating oil and natural gas property acquisitions in North America. Through our relationships with Diamondback and its affiliates, we have access to their significant pool of management talent and industry relationships, which we believe provide us with a competitive advantage in pursuing potential third-party acquisition opportunities.
Capitalize on the development of the properties underlying our mineral interests to grow our distributions. We expect the production from our mineral interest will increase as our other operators continue to actively drill our acreage. We expect to capitalize on this development, cost-free to us, and believe the resulting increase in our aggregate royalty payments will enable us to grow our distributions.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Viper defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest expense, non-cash unit-based compensation expense, depletion and impairment. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by United States’ generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows it to more effectively evaluate Viper’s operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of Viper’s operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Viper defines cash available for distribution generally as an amount equal to its Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable quarter less cash needed for debt service and other contractual obligations and fixed charges and reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of Viper’s general partner may deem appropriate. Viper’s computations of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies or to such measure in its credit facility or any of its other contracts.The following tables present a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution to the GAAP financial measure of net income (loss). Viper Energy Partners LP   (unaudited, in thousands, except per unit data)             Three Months Ended March 31,     2017 2016   Net income (loss) $ 20,652   $ (23,335 )   Interest expense 612   430     Non-cash unit-based compensation expense 819   973     Depletion 7,847   8,150     Impairment —   26,011     Adjusted EBITDA $ 29,930   $ 12,229             Adjustments to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to cash available for distribution:       Debt service, contractual obligations, fixed charges and reserves (480 ) (340 )   Cash available for distribution $ 29,450   $ 11,889             Limited Partner units outstanding 97,575   79,726             Cash available for distribution per limited partner unit $ 0.302   $ 0.149   ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAppeals court blocks California gas facility from reopeningAssociated PressThis Will Be In Everyone's Household By 2020Banyan HillSponsoredU.S. Oil And Gas Producers Add 8 Drilling Rigs This WeekThe StreetThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredThe real reason overseas manufacturing is coming to AmericaYahoo FinanceShell braces for 'lower forever' oil as profits soarReutersChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekJohn McCain: Here's why I voted no and killed the 'skinny repeal'Business InsiderTrump to cops: 'Please don't be too nice' while arresting 'thugs,' and don't worry about their heads when you toss them in the 'paddy wagon'Business InsiderWhat's the Problem with Joel Osteen?ChurchLeaders.comSponsoredAPNewsBreak: Yellowstone park cracks down on sex harassmentAssociated PressShell sees oil demand peaking by late 2020s as electric car sales growReutersJohn McCain Defends Health Care Vote As 'The Right Thing To Do'TallGpa: Today trump will tweet that McCain is unfit to be in office and call him a coward for being a prisoner of war.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
