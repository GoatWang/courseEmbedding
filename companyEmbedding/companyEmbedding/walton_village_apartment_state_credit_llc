Cultural Enrichment


Adventure Centers


Book of the Month



Each month we feature a unique local cultural attraction. Walton residents can visit the featured attraction of the month with their family members, and Walton will reimburse up to 90% of the ticket price for admission!
The Adventure Centers are a ministry of Parents with a Purpose, a local non-profit, faith-based organization. The program offers complimentary after-school enrichment programs for residents of select Walton Communities in grades K-5th.
Each month, residents are offered a complimentary book just by stopping in the leasing office. Selections fall into one of three categories: classical and timeless works of literature, biographies of great men and women, and personal growth.

















 Walton is the best community/apartment of which I have ever lived. It is truly amazing how the management and staff go above and beyond to make sure as a resident I am happy.  

Verified Resident





 I love living here. I love what Walton has done for myself and my family!  

Verified Resident





 Everything from the tour, maintenance, communication, community, etc, is done with excellence. The staff are very friendly and work hard to communicate clearly and efficiently. Very pleased with my experience.  

Verified Resident





 It is a beautiful community, and the apartments are well outfitted. The amenities are absolutely unique. I had settled on a different apartment community, but am glad that a friend decided to look at this one. It has worked out very well, and I am proud to live there.  

Verified Resident





 Great place to live. We're family here. Excellent programs. Friendly staff. Safe community.
