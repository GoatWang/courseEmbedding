Factom Harmony Takes On the Mortgage Industry

   Already working with the Department of Homeland Security and     the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to secure records on     their blockchain, Factom has now set its sights on the     trillion-dollar mortgage industry. Having launched its new     Factom Harmony      solution in March, the company hopes to attract big banks and     host their sensitive mortgage data. By increasing the     efficiency of document management, Harmony will allow a     seamless transaction process between lenders and brokers,     without them having to worry about lost documents, altered     agreements or incomplete records.       Built on the Factom Apollo data management solution, which     allows users to store and create immutable digital records,     Harmony "works with existing imaging or document management     solutions to create secure, transparent, unalterable records     for final loan documents." In the process, every file is     secured within a blockchain container, locking in the order of     the final documentation, recording each person who accesses     files and rejecting duplicate documents. Factom refers to this system as "a perfected digital audit     vault" for each specific loan. Thus the core product behind     Factom Harmony is called     Digital Vault      , which locks into time the most important closing documents     and gives a complete history of every file from origination to     close. As an all-inclusive solution, Factom Harmony   creates a permanent record and index of final loan         documents, making audits smooth by reducing quality         control, due diligence and review time;   reduces costs by creating a single source that organizes         the final documentation and provides cryptographic truth         that each document is an authentic copy;   provides access control to multiple parties that can         collaborate under audit conditions and exceptions, and         includes an immutable audit trail of all actions on each         document in real-time, giving a true history of every         loan;   opens a secure audit room or due diligence deal room         that can be tracked on the Factom blockchain.   According to Peter Kirby, CEO of Factom Inc., "The Harmony     solution and the underlying Factom blockchain provide lenders     with something that was fundamentally missing from the     industry. With Harmony, a lender is able to create a final set     of documents for each closed loan." Right now, origination of a loan has underlying costs of     about $7,500 per loan - up from approximately $2,500 per loan     in 2006. The costs have tripled over the last few years as     banks have been forced to step up their efforts to be in     compliance with new laws. Factom Harmony addresses many of the redundancy issues     associated with these efforts by permanently documenting the     process from the moment documents are first created, and then     allowing that data to be quickly shared and verified digitally.     Having digital records that can be securely shared and verified     also speeds up financial institutions' ability to settle     transaction among themselves. Factom does not claim to move     money faster, but it does attempt to allow others to have the     confidence in the data they are reviewing and thus speed up the     processes. According to Factom, Harmony is the first practical and     effective deployment of blockchain technology in the mortgage     industry. Through combining blockchain technology, advanced     cryptography tools and a digital fingerprint for each document     or data file, lenders can securely store and expose individual     loan files or documents to various third parties. "This technology dramatically changes the approach and     reduces the costs for audits, third-party reviews, litigation     costs and due diligence costs," Jason Nadeau, executive vice     president of Factom, said in a statement. "The combination of     blockchain and digital signature technology within Factom's     solution creates a solution where the benefits of digital     signatures and electronic vaulting are now available for all     documents without having to deploy any eMortgage or eClosing     technology." Toni Moss is the founder and CEO of     AmeriCatalyst LLC      , an advisory firm located in Austin, Texas, specializing in     corporate strategy, business development, market intelligence     and market positioning for companies engaged in all sectors of     the residential real-estate and housing finance industry in the     North American market. Moss has advised clients including     Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, the European     Commission and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Well-known in the     U.S. mortgage industry, she is a big fan of Factom Harmony, and     had this to say about the blockchain-based solution: "The industry remains disparate and fractured with regard to     the acquisition, management, distribution and protection of     data, with a wide variety of third-party providers, proprietary     platforms and programming languages. It's just a matter of time     before mortgage data is aggregated into a secure and     centralized industry utility - and blockchain [technology] is     the most promising catalyst to enable it," Moss said to     Bitcoin Magazine.  "As data becomes more plentiful, accurate, accessible and     immutable, investors will have the confidence to return to the     mortgage market; processing, servicing and transactional costs     (should) decrease; and the market itself will be far more     secure and sustainable in the long-term." Factom has yet to announce any contracts or partnerships     related to its mortgage solution, but the time is right for big     banks to start utilizing blockchain technology. In a separate     recent development for the company, the Factom blockchain was     made accessible to Chinese developers through     WanCloud      , a product released by Wanxiang Blockchain Corporation to     drive progress among Chinese enterprises.

PRESS RELEASE
Austin, TX (April 18, 2017) – Factom, Inc., a blockchain as-a-service (BaaS) technology company has closed their Series A funding at $8,029,796 USD following the launch of its mortgage product, Factom Harmony.
“The Factom Harmony launch was such a resounding success that we extended the Series A round for additional investors,” said Peter Kirby, Co-founder & CEO of Factom. “We’re very appreciative of our early investors who doubled-down on their participation and the new investors who are helping us strategically extend our reach. Many highly intelligent people worked very hard to help us get to this point and we couldn’t have done it without them.”
Earlier during the Series A round, Factom closed $5,326,522 USD in funding from Draper Associates, Stewart Title, Overstock, Fenbushi Capital, and Plug & Play. Now, Peeli Ventures, Harvest Equity, and a number of local Austin investors added another $2,703,274 USD, closing out the funding round.
“Factom’s Harmony product creates a transformative approach for the compliance in the U.S. mortgage industry,” said Harry Qin, Managing Partner of Peeli Ventures. “It has great potential to impact the mortgage industry with increased transparency and immutable audit records.”

Keeping Communication Lines Open
By William Bryan


Under Secretary (Acting) for Science and Technology William Bryan







This past week, I joined my team in Idaho Falls, Idaho for JamX 17. This jamming exercise, held at the Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory, gave us the opportunity to evaluate solutions to a threat that can leave responders in the dark in regard to communications—possibly escalating already dire situations.
The proliferation of jamming devices led us to look more closely at how they could impact responder communications. Last year, we held an exercise in White Sands, New Mexico to understand the problem. We assessed jamming vulnerabilities to responder communications systems and published an after action report (you can request a copy by contacting: jamming.exercise@hq.dhs.gov).
Building off of our work from last year, JamX 17 focused on the technologies and tactics that can be used to thwart jamming devices in the public safety sector.
Using test scenarios with nearly 300 participants from over 100 federal, state and local public safety and private sector organizations, the goal of JamX 17 was to help responders recognize, respond to, report and resolve jamming incidents. By evaluating these solutions, we can say with more certainty, how responders can be more resilient to the threats of jamming.
Being in Idaho Falls with so many men and women who are working to protect us crystallized how important it is that we bolster our capability to mitigate and overcome this threat. I was grateful to be joined by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Federal Emergency Management Agency among many others on this trip.
When I think about the men and women who are working to protect us—in our communities, at our borders and ports of entry, I know how important it is that they are able to respond quickly and effectively. This is an issue that is important to all of us because we all rely on their work to keep the nation safe and secure.
Out of this exercise, we look forward to bringing these entities solutions. You can find more information regarding last year’s exercise can be found on DHS S&T’s jamming exercise page, which will be updated with more information as we evaluate feedback from this year’s exercise. To learn more, visit S&T and get connected today @dhsscitech on Twitter and Facebook!

Factom, Inc. Welcomes Three Veteran Executives


Mahesh Paolini-Subramanya
Laurie Pyle
Factom, Inc., a blockchain as a service company that provides products offering document and data integrity as its EVP of R&D, recently announced the addition of three veteran executives: Mahesh Paolini-Subramanya, Laurie Pyle, and Jason Nadeau.
Mahesh Paolini-Subramanya comes to Factom from Cielo24, a media intelligence company, where he served as EVP. He has also held positions as VP of R&D and head of Cloud-teams at Ubiquiti Networks, a networking technology provider. He also founded Aptela, which became one of the largest cloud-based unified communication services in the nation. Aptela was later acquired by Vonage.
Jason Nadeau
“Factom’s unique technology brings reliability, scalability, and ease-of-use to the blockchain world,” said Paolini-Subramanya. “Bringing immutability and referencability to documents, be they blobs or structured data, while still providing the performance characteristics necessary to survive in the high-volume and high-velocity world of modern services—this is a game-changer.”
In her new role at Factom, Laurie Pyle will lead the creation of a suite of mortgage technology products. Pyle has extensive experience in the mortgage technology field, including helping create the nation’s largest mortgage electronic network. Previously, she served as managing director at Corsair Associates. She has also served as EVP and CIO of Stewart Lender Services, where she headed the technology and operations teams. She was also a founding executive at RealEC Technologies, where she oversaw product strategy, product design, and client solutions.
“I am very excited to be working with the Factom team,” said Pyle. “Factom protocol has great potential to significantly impact a number of facets of the mortgage industry for the better with increased transparency and indelible audit records.”
Jason Nadeau will lead mortgage strategy, revenue growth, and business development strategy at Factom. With more than 20 years’ experience in mortgage technology, Nadeau most recently served as Senior Director at Corsair Associates, where he offered strategic consulting to mortgage technology companies. He has also served as Group President at Stewart Title and CEO of Stewart Lender Services, leading the company’s business lines and technology services. Nadeau also served as Founder, President and CTO of RealEC Technologies. In this role, he helped develop the largest electronic partner network for the mortgage industry.
“The Factom solutions for the Mortgage Industry are some of the most innovative, yet easy adopted, ones that I’ve encountered,” said Nadeau. “The ability to apply blockchain technology to the documentation and data challenges of the mortgage industry creates a completely new paradigm for compliance.”

Factom’s 1st Anniversary
By Tiana Laurence – CMO






Our quest to secure the world's systems and data has been exciting and challenging so far. The simple, yet powerful idea of Factom has led us to travel all over the world. We have been blessed to speak with leaders from almost every industry. 
It has become clear that data and system integrity is a significant problem worth solving. There is a strong need for permanent, unchangeable data across both public and private sectors. 
Over the last two years, we have been working hard to make Factom a reality. We have come a long way from our very first speech on Factom by Brian Deery, our chief scientist.













Building revolutionary technology does not happen overnight. One year ago today we launched the Factom Genesis Network and secured the first records on the Factom Network. These records included the Declaration of Human Rights and the Gutenberg Library, which includes many of the world’s famous public domain books. A year later we have secured more than 58 million records on the Factom Network.
The basic functionality of publishing and validating data is just the beginning. 
We are building Factom so that developers can utilize permanent and unchangeable data, at scale, in any application. The first pioneers have been DataYes, Ancun, Intrinio, and Poloniex helping us secure stock market data, notarize documents, and build a digital history that developers can build on.
We are launching an updated brand and website on our anniversary. The new website integrates Factom.com and Factom.org websites, giving us a clean, unified look and feel. The website has a dedicated section devoted to our development community. We will be rolling out new resources and tools to support our valued community over the next few weeks. Our Acolyte service for Smart Contract oracle creation is available for alpha testing now.
We have also added the Factom Live Network Usage ticker. This exciting new feature allows anyone to see how many records, entries, and anchors have been placed into the Factom network in real time.
If you come across mistakes or things that just don’t feel right, while exploring our newly branded website, please let us know. You can send us reports about bugs you find to to our contact page here.
Thanks for being an awesome and supportive community.
The Factom Team

DHS S&T Awards $199K to Austin Based Factom Inc. for Internet of Things Systems Security
 




 
Release Date: June 17, 2016For Immediate ReleaseDHS Science & Technology Press OfficeContact: John Verrico, (202) 254-2385
WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) today awarded $199,000 to Factom Inc. based in Austin, Texas, to advance the security of digital identity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  The project titled “Blockchain Software to Prove Integrity of Captured Data From Border Devices” was awarded through Securing the Internet of Things (IoT), Solicitation Number: HSHQDC-16-R-00035, the first call for proposals under the Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP)  Other Transaction Solicitation (OTS) which launched in December 2015 to encourage non-traditional performers to offer solutions to some of the toughest threats facing DHS and the homeland security mission. 
“IoT devices are embedded within our daily lives – from the vehicle we drive to devices we wear – it’s critical to safeguard these devices from adversaries, said DHS Under Secretary for Science and Technology Dr. Reginald Brothers. “S&T is excited to engage our nation’s innovators, helping us to develop novel solutions for the Homeland Security Enterprise.”
The Internet of Things is a convergence of mobile devices, information technology networks, connected sensors and devices. The DHS OTS call for security solutions seeks novel ideas and technologies to improve situational awareness and security for protecting these domains, including the 16 critical infrastructure sectors monitored by DHS.
“The start-up community is already developing innovative commercial solutions for IoT, so why not take advantage of that?” said Melissa Ho, Managing Director, S&T’s Silicon Valley Innovation Program. “DHS is engaging this community to gain access to products that will have a large impact to our enterprise, and we’re excited by the diversity of solutions this solicitation is able to bring to the Department.”    
The Factom Inc. Team proposes to authenticate devices to prevent spoofing and ensure data integrity by leveraging one of the most secure networks – the blockchain. Factom will create an identity log that captures the identification of a device, who manufactured it, lists of available updates, known security issues and granted authorities while adding the dimension of time for added security. The goal is to limit would-be hackers’ abilities to corrupt the past records for a device, making it more difficult to spoof.
