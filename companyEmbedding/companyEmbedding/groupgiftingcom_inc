 Today, GroupGifting.com, announced that it has completed the implementation of Kount, Inc. as its partner in delivering fraud detection and prevention services for MyGiftWand, the company’s social gifting service. Kount provides best of breed card-not-present fraud prevention. Its advanced systems are being used to protect some of the best-known brands in the world. The MyGiftWand service provides users with the ability to send, contribute to, receive and redeem eGift Cards for more than 40 brands using Facebook, iPhone or Android apps in just a couple of clicks. 
“We have chosen Kount as our fraud-prevention partner because of their world-class card-not-present experience, and because the service is a great fit with the proprietary systems that we already have in place,” said Tyler Roye, CEO of GroupGifting.com. 
Kount’s proven technology has already reviewed hundreds of millions of transactions for companies around the world providing fraud protection using its real-time analytics and Risk Decision Rules Engine. Simply reacting to suspicious transactions is no longer an option in the fast-moving world of digital fraud. Kount is a recognized solution because of their ability to perform proactive, real-time processing.
“With response times that average less than 350 milliseconds, there’s no disruption in our end user’s experience. That’s critically important to us,” said Roye. Additionally, the solution helps users of GroupGifting.com’s MyGiftWand Facebook and mobile apps to benefit from the last-minute-gifting potential of eGift Cards.   “We can release cards with confidence, knowing that we have our best-of-breed fraud protection in place,” added Roye.  
When a transaction occurs, hundreds of risk variables are analyzed and weighted in real-time to create a clear picture of the risk and are sent to Kount’s Risk Decision Rules Engine. Based on a customizable set of rules the Risk Decision Rules Engine approves, declines, or forwards the transaction for further review. The customizable rules provide a level of flexibility and the ability for the system to be adapted to new, growing business models and types of transactions as needed in the future and that is important to innovative companies like GroupGifting.com. “Kount helps us lower our fraud costs so we can price our services more competitively,” said Roye.  
“Companies are looking for maximum protection from fraud and other associated risks for both themselves and their customers. Kount was developed to help businesses working in card-not-present environments avoid the damage fraudsters can cause such as lost product, wasted time and operational expense while confidently growing sales,” said Kount COO Steve Rouse.
“In the end, our job is to enable a social gifting process that gets eGift Cards to the customer and the customer to the store”, said Roye. “Kount provides a level of service that allows fraud protection to occur seamlessly and without impact on the end user experience allowing us to concentrate on what we do best - unlocking the potential of commerce in social and mobile spaces by providing a great end-user experience and great service to our retailer customers.”
MyGiftWand allows retailers to make promotional eGift Cards available to Facebook users based on the age, gender and location of the recipient in a true friend-to-friend marketing environment. The service can be used by retailers to reach completely new groups of customers or as a tool for brands to monetize prior social investments by activating a powerful social chain reaction through their own fan base.  Because retailers only pay a fee for the service when the recipient comes to the store and uses the eGift Card it is a true Cost-Per-Acquisition model.

The Patent Description & Claims data below is from USPTO Patent Application 20160292671, Systems and methods for gifting of products, stored value instruments, or both.
BACKGROUND  - Top of Page
1. Technical Field
The present disclosure relates to systems and methods for providing stored value instruments as gifts via eCommerce systems and/or social networks, and, more particularly, for enabling a gift organizer to suggest a product as a gift and sending the gift suggestion and the stored value instrument to the gift recipient in place of the product.
2. Background of Related Art
Social commerce is growing rapidly due to the growth of social networks and eCommerce systems designed to work in conjunction with social networks. People exchange gifts for a variety of events or occasions. Choosing the right gift is often a challenging task because of the unique needs and wants of a gift recipient along with the many choices offered from a multitude of merchants via eCommerce websites.
The act of gift giving is further complicated when more than one participant contributes to a gift. Typically, the burden of choosing the gift, collecting funds from contributors, having those contributors sign a greeting card, and delivering the gift to a recipient is on the shoulders of the gift organizer.
In many cases, a gift recipient receives a gift that they really do not want. This results in returned or exchanged products, which has an impact on the cost to merchants, imposes an inconvenience on the gift recipient, and results in an overall poor gifting experience for all parties involved.
Giving gift cards as an alternative to a physical gift is an accepted practice and, in many cases, is preferred by gift recipients. There are many systems for purchasing and sending electronic gift cards and physical gifts via eCommerce websites, either as an individual or as a group.
SUMMARY  - Top of Page
The present disclosure features a system that allows for the creation of a gift based on a product selected by gift organizers from an eCommerce website. Gift organizers can use the system as a tool to collect funds to be applied toward a stored value instrument, e.g., as a group gift, and to deliver the stored value instrument and personalized messages, videos, and photos from some or all gift participants to a gift recipient.
The present disclosure also features a gifting system that converts attributes about a product selected from an eCommerce website into a gift idea. Gift organizers can use the system as a tool to collect funds toward a product as a group gift and to deliver personalized messages, videos, and photos from all gift participants along with a notification of the gift idea and a stored value instrument that can be used by a gift recipient to purchase the selected product or any other product from a eCommerce website merchant.
The present disclosure further features a gifting system that can deliver notifications to a recipient of a stored value instrument that can be used to purchase a product and deliver personalized messages, videos, and photos from all gift participants. Since the system gives the gift recipient a stored value instrument instead of a physical product as a gift, the entire gifting experience is improved for those organizing a gift, those contributing to the gift and, most importantly, those receiving a gift.
In one aspect, the gifting system may be used to facilitate a group gift based on a given product that is selected from a merchant's product catalog published on an eCommerce website. A group gift is a gift that involves participation, either monetary or non-monetary, by more than one person.
In another aspect, the gifting system can be used to facilitate a social gift based on a product that is selected from a merchant's product catalog published on an eCommerce website. A social gift is a gift that involves participation, either monetary or non-monetary, by at least one person via a social network.
The gifting system takes the selected gift displayed on a merchant's eCommerce website and based on various calculations, business rules and user input, makes a determination to deliver the gift to the recipient as a stored value instrument. For example, a stored value instrument could be a gift card, a gift certificate, or a store credit, any of which can then be used by the gift recipient to purchase the originally suggested product or any other product available from the merchant. The gift notification includes a link that allows the gift recipient to claim the stored value instrument, along with personal messages, videos, and photos from the participants, which are delivered to the recipient along with the gift via social networks, email, short message service (SMS), etc.
The present disclosure features a method for electronically providing a stored value instrument in place of a suggested product as a gift. The method includes receiving from at least a first electronic device associated with a first user a request to suggest a product, which is defined by data stored in an eCommerce server, as a gift for a second user associated with at least a second electronic device, obtaining data of the product from the eCommerce server; authenticating the first user of the at least the first electronic device, determining a contribution amount; receiving funds from the first user to be applied towards the contribution amount, determining whether a predetermined condition has been met; and sending a message to the second user including the data of product suggested as a gift to the second user and a stored value instrument to the second user, if the predetermined condition has been met.
The method further includes displaying a screen on the at least the first electronic device prompting the first user to invite at least a third user associated with at least a third electronic device to contribute towards the cost of the product, sending an invitation message to the at least the third electronic device, the invitation message including a link to view the product, a setting of the contribution amount, and a personalized message field, and receiving funds from the at least a third user to be applied towards the contribution amount. In an aspect, the invitation message is sent to the at least a third user via a social network, an email, or an SMS message.
The method still further includes prompting the first user to manually set a contribution amount or automatically calculating contribution amounts. In an aspect, the stored value instrument is selected from a group consisting of a gift card, a gift certificate, a store credit, an online credit, an offline credit, a coupon, and any combinations thereof
The method still further includes receiving a claim for the stored value instrument from the at least a second electronic device associated with a second user, and receiving a message from the at least a second electronic device to be provided to at least the first user. In an aspect, determining whether the predetermined condition is met includes at least one of determining whether a predetermined period has elapsed and determining whether a total contribution amount is greater than or equal to the target contribution amount. In another aspect, the at least a third user includes a plurality of users, wherein determining whether a predetermined condition is met includes determining whether the first user and the plurality of users have all contributed funds towards the contribution amount.
The method still further includes determining the gift type, converting the contributed funds to a stored value instrument if it is determined that the gift type is a stored value instrument, and sending a message to order the product if it is determined that the gift type is a physical product.
The method still further includes determining whether a total contribution amount is greater than the cost of the product to determine whether there are additional funds, and converting the additional funds to a stored value instrument if it is determined that the total contribution amount is greater than the cost of the product.
In an aspect, the obtained data regarding the product is selected from the group consisting of a price, a tax, a shipping cost, a description, an image of the product, and any combinations thereof.
In another aspect, obtaining data of the product from the eCommerce server includes dynamically analyzing a webpage of the eCommerce server to obtain data regarding the product.
In embodiments, the present disclosure also features a gifting system for electronically providing a stored value instrument in place of a suggested product as a gift. The gifting system includes a processor and a memory storing processor-executable instructions that, when executed by the processor, cause the gifting system to receive from at least a first electronic device associated with a first user a request to suggest a product, which is defined by data stored in an eCommerce server, as a gift for a second user associated with at least a second electronic device, obtain data of the product from the eCommerce server, authenticate the first user of the at least the first electronic device, determine a contribution amount, receive funds from the first user to be applied towards the contribution amount, determine whether a predetermined condition has been met, and send a message to the second user including the data of product suggested as a gift to the second user and a stored value instrument to the second user, if the predetermined condition has been met.
The present disclosure also features a system including a page analyzer and a gifting engine. The page analyzer gathers attributes about a product selected by an organizer as a gift from an eCommerce website server. The gifting engine configured to create a screen to present the selected product as a suggested gift based on the product attributes gathered by the page analyzer, and to convert the selected product to a stored value instrument when a predetermined condition is met. The system may further include an interface coupled to the gifting engine. The interface retrieves data about the product from a plurality of external data sources and transfers the data about the product to the gifting engine. The gifting engine may create the screen presenting the selected product as a suggested gift based on the data about the product.
