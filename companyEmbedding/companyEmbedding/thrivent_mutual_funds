No question, index funds have enjoyed strong performance the past seven years during the second longest bull market run in U.S. history. But if the market should stumble under the weight of the recent tepid economic conditions and the prospect of rising interest rates, a new Thrivent Mutual Funds Active vs. Passive Study, suggests that investors in index funds may be well served to consider switching their dollars to actively-managed funds.
The study shows that during the two market crashes of the 21st Century, the S&P 5001 significantly trailed actively-managed large cap no-load funds.  In fact, as the following graphs demonstrate, the index wouldn’t even have ranked in the top 50% in terms of performance during a single 12-month stretch of the Dot-Com Crash of 2000 – 2003, and would have trailed its peer group during 93.1% of the Global Financial Crisis of 2007 – 2009:

In fact, as the next graph shows, the index trailed the universe of actively-managed large cap no-load  funds the majority of the time over the entire course of the volatile decade of 2000 through 2009.


The S&P 500 is not the only index to experience sub-par performance relative to actively-managed funds during bear markets and extended periods. The study also focused on the Russell 2000 Index2  of small stocks.
While the Russell 2000 has done well versus the actively-managed fund universe during most of the recent bull market, it would have ranked in the bottom (4th) quartile of the small cap category during 90.3% of the 31 rolling 12-month periods of the Dot-Com Crash. In fact, the index would have ranked in the bottom half of corresponding actively-managed, no-load funds the majority of the time over the past 25 years, dating back to 1992, as the following chart shows.
Why Now?
If you’re concerned that the long bull market run is winding down or that the recent rise in interest rates will continue, or if you’re apprehensive about the uncertainty of a new administration, this may be the time to consider switching from index funds to actively-managed funds. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, as the Thrivent Mutual Funds Active vs. Passive Study demonstrated, the no-load actively-managed funds in the study have done a better job of limiting losses than their corresponding indexes during the recent bear markets and volatile market stretches.
To achieve even greater diversification, investors may consider actively-managed asset allocation funds, which offer broad diversification across multiple asset classes.  While diversification does not eliminate risk, it generally helps reduce losses during steep stock market declines.
Here are several other reasons to consider switching to actively-managed funds:

Flexibility. Some managed funds have done better than index funds during down markets due, in part, we believe, to the fact that fund managers have had the ability to make some adjustments in their portfolios to reduce the stocks or sectors that appear the most problematic. Investment managers can also use risk management techniques and diversification that seek to provide similar returns to the market with lower risk and volatility.
Help when needed most. A rising tide lifts all boats. Ever since the Federal Reserve launched quantitative easing activities intended to stabilize the economy and lower interest rates, all of that extra capital in the system has flowed to equities across the board, boosting market returns while greatly increasing correlations among stocks. That means that all equities, even stocks that many active managers think are unattractive, have generally gone up together, with higher risk companies that carry more debt on their books actually leading the way as the low interest rates have distorted the risks inherent in holding too much debt.

That’s been an advantage for index funds, since they own all equities, even those presumably “higher risk” stocks that active managers are avoiding. But while an index fund may (or may not) offer better returns in a bull market, active managers tend to provide their greatest value during bear markets when investors need their help the most. Normally, and particularly so in bear markets, stocks experience a wide variety of rates of return, meaning that index funds will be exposed to both the good performers and the bad, while active managers have a better opportunity to avoid those bad performers.

A better chance to beat the market. The fact is index funds perpetually trail the market by a small margin. Their costs, while minimal, create a small differential between the market performance and their own returns. As the study demonstrates, in any given year, actively-managed funds can, and have, outperformed the market.
Active funds have responded by lowering fees. Actively-managed mutual funds have responded to the low fees of index funds by lowering their own fees over the past 20 years. According to the Investment Company Institute, the average equity mutual fund expense ratio was 1.08% in 1994 and dropped to just 0.68% in 2015.3 The lower fees would add, on average, about 0.40% per year to the returns of actively-managed funds. All other expenses remaining the same, in general, lowering fees results in an increase to the total returns of equity mutual funds.
Limiting market losses can speed up your recovery. Actively managed funds may not always cut your losses, but if you are successful in reducing your losses in a down market through an actively-managed fund, the road to recovery becomes much easier. In fact, the bigger the loss, the more difficult it becomes to recover from that loss. For instance, for a 5% loss, you would need a gain of 5.26% to restore your portfolio to its previous level. But with a 20% loss, you would need a gain of 25% to get back to even; a 30% loss would require a gain of 42.9% to fully recover; and a 50% loss would require a 100% gain to bring the portfolio back to its previous level.

In terms of pure long-term performance, index funds may (or may not) have a slight edge. But when the chips are down and the markets are reeling, the Thrivent Mutual Funds study suggests that you may be better served to have an active manager in your corner making the crucial decisions.
Results
The tables below summarize some of the key results of the study during the Dot-Com Crash, the Global Financial Crisis and the decade of 2000 – 2010.
The table headings include: Lipper funds category (“large cap core” or “small cap core”), Index (S&P 500 or Russell 2000), the four performance quartiles (the higher the percentage the worse the relative performance), and the Average Percentile Ranking.
The Average Percentile Ranking is not tied to the quartile rankings, and provides a different vantage point on the comparative performance. It measures the average percentile of how they ranked over the given period of time. As with the quartile rankings, a lower percentage indicates better performance while a higher percentage indicates worse performance. For example, in the Dot-Com Crash table below, the average percentage of the S&P 500 was 70.6%, which put it in the bottom 30% among all funds in that category.  The Russell 2000 Index fared even worse with an 81.9% average percentage – which means it would have ranked in the bottom 18.1% of funds in the small cap category.
In the following charts, please keep in mind that the 1st quartile represents the best performance and the 4th quartile represents the worst. For example, in the first table entitled “Dot-Com Crash,” you will see “0.0%” in the 1st and 2nd quartiles for each of the two indexes. That indicates that neither the S&P 500 nor the Russell 2000 would have ranked in the top half (1st or 2nd quartiles) in performance in their respective actively-managed no-load fund groups during a single 12-month period from Sept. 31, 2000 through March 31, 2003.

A Happy Retirement Starts with a Smart Approach
You want a comfortable retirement. We have the tools to help you get there. Retirement accounts through Thrivent Mutual Funds can be part of building your nest egg for the long haul. We do this by offering three things:



The potential for growth with tax advantages



A variety of investment options



Earnings that can compound over time



Learn about our Retirement Accounts






Our Retirement Accounts


Traditional IRA

Traditional IRA
An individual retirement account in which contributions may be tax deductible. Earnings in your account accumulate tax deferred.  Distributions are taxed on withdrawal from the account.
Why it might be for you:

No Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) contribution limits
You think you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement
You aren’t currently covered by an employer-sponsored plan

Learn moreLearn more about traditional IRAs



Roth IRA

Roth IRA
An individual retirement account to which you make after-tax contributions and if you meet certain qualifications, can take earnings out tax-free.
Why it might be for you:

Your 2016 adjusted gross income is less than $132,000 (2017: $133,000) for single tax filers or $194,000 (2017: $196,000) for joint filers
You think you will be in a higher tax bracket in retirement
You want to let your money remain invested as long as you want without being required to start withdrawals at a certain age

Simple is Putting All of Your Retirement Assets into One Place
The days of working for a single company your entire career have long passed. Chances are, you’ll have worked at a number of businesses by the time you retire. Which means that, like most people, you could have IRA and 401(k) assets scattered across several accounts and firms. Now may be the time to consider taking control of these important assets by rolling them into an IRA offered by Thrivent Mutual Funds.2 Potential benefits include:


Investment flexibility
Thrivent Mutual Funds provides a variety of investment options, some of which may not be available in your employer’s plan.
Easier management
When all of your retirement savings are in one place, it's easier to manage your accounts and monitor your progress.


Continue tax advantages
Like your 401(k) or other retirement plan, a Thrivent Mutual Fund IRA offers important tax benefits.
Of course, your best option may be to leave your assets where they are. Keep in mind that rolling over assets to an IRA is just one of multiple options for your retirement plan. 









Important Considerations





When considering moving your retirement assets it’s important to review your needs and circumstances, and consider the following factors:
Investment Options & Fees
Compare the options you currently have with those available with Thrivent Mutual Funds, including investment fees and other expenses.
Services Offered
Plans and providers potentially offer a variety of account services you may want. Compare current services and conveniences to those available with Thrivent Mutual Funds.
Distribution Flexibility
Both IRAs and employer-sponsored plans may offer distribution options you want or need. Compare access to early withdrawals, loans, employer stock considerations, required minimum distributions and distribution frequency.
Creditor protections
Generally, employer sponsored plans have unlimited protection from creditors under federal law. IRA assets are less protected and laws vary by state.
LEARN MORE



Options for Moving Assets

Options for Moving Assets
Have your employer-sponsored retirement plan assets sent directly to your Thrivent Mutual Funds IRA with a Direct Rollover.
Or, take receipt of your retirement assets and deposit them into your IRA within 60 days with an Indirect Rollover. Keep in mind you will incur a mandatory 20% tax withholding for distributions from employer qualified plans and you are limited to one indirect rollover per 12 month period for all your retirement assets.
With an IRA to IRA Transfer you can move your retirement assets from your current IRA to a Thrivent Mutual Fund IRA. 
If you’re looking at a Thrivent Mutual Fund Roth IRA, consider moving your retirement assets from your employer-sponsored plan or traditional IRA with a Roth IRA Conversion. You may have to pay federal or state income taxes on all or part of the conversion amount.
LEARN MORELink to Making Sense of Rollovers and Transfers.










Ready to Rollover?
Follow these simple steps to make it happen and start investing with Thrivent Mutual Funds.



Research and gather what’s needed from your current plan sponsor or IRA custodian.



Identify and set up a Thrivent Mutual Fund IRA for your assets.



Complete the rollover request form on-line or in paper.



Send the request to Thrivent Mutual Funds to initiate the movement of your assets.






2You can roll over assets from an employer-sponsored retirement plan to an IRA if you experience one of the following triggering events (as permitted by the plan document): termination of service, retirement, reaching age 59½, disability, plan termination, death, or proceeds received from former spouse’s retirement plan due to a divorce.

Invest in the Next Generation
Custodial and education accounts are a great way to look after future generations. We offer the tools you need to help take care of a kid’s future the same way you take care of your own.
Things to keep in mind:
 


Time is on your side.
One of your greatest assets is your time. Starting early in saving is critical to lessening the financial impact that may occur when college starts.


Once it’s theirs, it’s theirs.
When an account is created in a child’s name, the fund can only be used for that child’s benefit.


They could gain access at age 18.
Through the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA), the child can access the money usually between the ages of 18-21.







Consider This

In 2015, the average student loan debt was $30,100 per borrower.

Accounts for Kids


Coverdell Education Savings Account

Coverdell Education Savings Account
Grow money tax deferred and withdraw proceeds tax-free for qualified education expenses. And unlike 529 savings plans, a Coverdell account can be used towards qualified primary and secondary school costs in addition to college costs.
Learn moreLearn more about Coverdell Education Savings Accounts



Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)

Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)
Establish and manage an investment account for a child, for education or other qualified expenses. These accounts are irrevocable gifts that ensure the assets will be used to benefit a child. Since the money does not have a specified purpose, no penalties are imposed if used for something other than education. These accounts may previously have been referred to or known as Uniform Gifts to Minors (UGMAs).

When It Comes to Investing, It’s All About Options

Performance Summary | Thrivent Mutual Funds












































Skip to main content















Average Annual Total Returns



Public Offering Price: The price at which the fund is offered to the public including any sales charge.
Net Asset Value: The NAV is the fund’s value or price per share. The NAV is calculated by dividing the market value of all the fund’s shares (minus its liabilities) by the number of issued shares. 
Max Sales Charge: The sales charge applied at the time of an initial purchase of mutual fund shares. The charge is deducted from the amount being invested, so a front-end load lowers the size of the investment. This only applies to A shares.
Money Market 7 Day Current: The yield generated by an investment in the fund over a 7-day period ended on the date of the calculation and expressed as an annual percentage.
Money Market 7 Day Effective: Similar to the 7-Day Current, except that the effective yield assumes that income earned from the fund's investments is reinvested and generating additional income. It’s expressed as an annual percentage.
Gross Expense Ratio: This figure represents the total percentage of a mutual fund’s assets used to maintain the fund, including operating expenses and management fees. It does not include the impact of any fee waivers or expense reimbursements that may have been in effect during the time period. It’s calculated by dividing the fund’s annual operating expenses by the average dollar value of its assets.
Net Expense Ratio: This figure represents the total percentage of a mutual fund’s assets used to maintain the fund, including operating expenses and management fees. It’s calculated by dividing the fund’s annual net operating expenses by the average dollar value of its assets, and includes the impact of any fee waivers or expense reimbursements that may have been in effect during the time period.
Performance shown assumes the reinvest of all dividends and capital gains. Performance of other share classes will vary from the results shown based on differences in sales charges and expenses.
Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.

You could lose money by investing in Thrivent Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to present the value of our investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1The Adviser has contractually agreed, for as long as the current fee structure is in place, to waive certain investment advisory fees associated with the Fund. Refer to the expense table in the Fund’s prospectus.
2The Adviser has contractually agreed, through at least February 28, 2018, to reimburse certain expenses associated with the Fund. Refer to the expense table in the Fund’s prospectus for details.
3The Expense Ratio may not include certain voluntary expense reimbursements that reduce the actual expense of the fund. The voluntary reimbursements can be discontinued at any time. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the Thrivent Money Market Fund than the total return quotation. The 7-Day Yield Without Reimbursement is the yield without any fee reimbursements applied.
4Performance shown reflects the current maximum sales charge of 4.5%. Prior to February 29, 2016, the maximum sales charge was 5.5%; however, the prior rate is not reflected for periods that began prior to that date.

All returns represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The value of an investment fluctuates so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Call 800-847-4836 or visit ThriventFunds.com for performance results current to the most recent month-end.
You could lose money by investing in Thrivent Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to present the value of our investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1The Adviser has contractually agreed, for as long as the current fee structure is in place, to waive certain investment advisory fees associated with the Fund. Refer to the expense table in the Fund’s prospectus.
2The Adviser has contractually agreed, through at least February 28, 2018, to reimburse certain expenses associated with the Fund. Refer to the expense table in the Fund’s prospectus for details.
3The Expense Ratio may not include certain voluntary expense reimbursements that reduce the actual expense of the fund. The voluntary reimbursements can be discontinued at any time. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the Thrivent Money Market Fund than the total return quotation. The 7-Day Yield Without Reimbursement is the yield without any fee reimbursements applied.

You could lose money by investing in Thrivent Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to present the value of our investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1The Adviser has contractually agreed, for as long as the current fee structure is in place, to waive certain investment advisory fees associated with the Fund. Refer to the expense table in the Fund’s prospectus.
2The Adviser has contractually agreed, through at least February 28, 2018, to reimburse certain expenses associated with the Fund. Refer to the expense table in the Fund’s prospectus for details.
3The Expense Ratio may not include certain voluntary expense reimbursements that reduce the actual expense of the fund. The voluntary reimbursements can be discontinued at any time. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the Thrivent Money Market Fund than the total return quotation. The 7-Day Yield Without Reimbursement is the yield without any fee reimbursements applied.
4Performance shown reflects the current maximum sales charge of 4.5%. Prior to February 29, 2016, the maximum sales charge was 5.5%; however, the prior rate is not reflected for periods that began prior to that date.

All returns represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The value of an investment fluctuates so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Call 800-847-4836 or visit ThriventFunds.com for performance results current to the most recent month-end.
You could lose money by investing in Thrivent Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to present the value of our investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1The Adviser has contractually agreed, for as long as the current fee structure is in place, to waive certain investment advisory fees associated with the Fund. Refer to the expense table in the Fund’s prospectus.
2The Adviser has contractually agreed, through at least February 28, 2018, to reimburse certain expenses associated with the Fund. Refer to the expense table in the Fund’s prospectus for details.
3The Expense Ratio may not include certain voluntary expense reimbursements that reduce the actual expense of the fund. The voluntary reimbursements can be discontinued at any time. The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the Thrivent Money Market Fund than the total return quotation. The 7-Day Yield Without Reimbursement is the yield without any fee reimbursements applied.

Money Market 7-Day Current Yield3
					  : 0.52%					  
					






All returns represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The value of an investment fluctuates so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Call 800-847-4836 or visit ThriventFunds.com for performance results current to the most recent month-end. 
You could lose money by investing in Thrivent Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to present the value of our investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1The Adviser has contractually agreed, for as long as the current fee structure is in place, to waive certain investment advisory fees associated with the Fund. Refer to the expense table in the Fund's prospectus.
2The Adviser has contractually agreed through at least February 28, 2018 to reimburse certain expenses associated with the Fund. If they had not, performance data shown would be lower. Refer to the Expense Table in the Fund's prospectus for details.
3The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the Thrivent Money Market Fund than the total return quotation.

Money Market 7-Day Current Yield3
					  : 0.52%					  
					






All returns represent past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The value of an investment fluctuates so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original investment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Call 800-847-4836 or visit ThriventFunds.com for performance results current to the most recent month-end. 
You could lose money by investing in Thrivent Money Market Fund. Although the Fund seeks to present the value of our investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.
1The Adviser has contractually agreed, for as long as the current fee structure is in place, to waive certain investment advisory fees associated with the Fund. Refer to the expense table in the Fund's prospectus.
2The Adviser has contractually agreed through at least February 28, 2018 to reimburse certain expenses associated with the Fund. If they had not, performance data shown would be lower. Refer to the Expense Table in the Fund's prospectus for details.
3The yield quotation more closely reflects the current earnings of the Thrivent Money Market Fund than the total return quotation.
