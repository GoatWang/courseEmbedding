reduce energy production and lead to costly repairs. Our leading
edge protection, based on the same technology used in the aerospace
industry to protect helicopter blades, maintains turbine
efficiency, reduces downtime and maintenance, and extends the
useful life of blades - even in the harshest environments.




Everyday Products at WorkThanks to our legacy of paper-making excellence, we serve a growing number of industries that rely on highly engineered fiber-based components for their products.

(ALPHARETTA,  GA) July 17, 2017 -  Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. (NYSE:
SWM)  recently held  its first  China Alkaline  Forum in  Shanghai. As the world
leader  in alkaline battery separator paper, SWM took the initiative to organize
this  one-day event, which was the first  of its kind, to bring together leading
suppliers  and alkaline battery  manufacturers. The purpose  of the Forum was to
share  information regarding  the state  of the  industry, as  well as to update
participants  on capabilities,  product ranges  and innovations  in the field of
battery  separators and other strategic materials, such as graphite, zinc powder
and electrolytic manganese dioxide.

The   2017 China   Alkaline   Forum   was   attended   by  more  than  20 senior
representatives  from 10 of the  top battery manufacturers  in China. During the
event,  the group heard technical presentations,  given by four leading material
suppliers.  The  Forum  also  included  time  for  the  attendees to discuss and
collaborate  on  opportunities  and  challenges  facing  the  industry today and
tomorrow.

Philippe  Ragot,  Business  Director  of  SWM's Energy Storage group, commented,
"This  event provided  another occasion  for SWM  to show  its commitment to the
alkaline  battery industry and of our desire to partner with all stakeholders to
continuously  generate  more  value.  Our  Alkaline  Forum  was  the first event
specifically   designed  to  bring  high-level  alkaline  battery  professionals
together.  The  success  of  the  event  showed  how  this  group  is focused on
performance  and  innovation,  and  how  much  collaboration is required. Beyond
alkaline,  the  SWM  team  is  working  on leveraging its unique capabilities to
provide  more separator, substrate and material  solutions to the energy storage
industry."

					Full Description



Schweitzer-Mauduit International, Inc. (SWM), incorporated on August 21, 1995, is a diversified producer of engineered solutions and materials for a variety of industries. The Company has two operating product line segments: Engineered Papers, and Advanced Materials and Structures. As of December 31, 2016, the Company conducted business in over 90 countries and operate 18 production locations across the world, with facilities in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Luxembourg, Russia, Brazil, China and Poland.Engineered PapersThrough its Engineered Papers (EP) segment, the Company primarily serves the tobacco industry via the manufacture and sale of paper and reconstituted tobacco products. The primary products sold to the tobacco industry include cigarette, plug wrap and base tipping papers, or Cigarette Papers, which are used to wrap various parts of a cigarette, reconstituted tobacco leaf (RTL), which is used as a blend with virgin tobacco in cigarettes, and reconstituted tobacco wrappers and binders for cigars. These products are sold directly to tobacco companies or their designated converters in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere. The EP segment is a manufacturer of lightweight specialty papers used in manufacturing banded papers used in the production of lower ignition propensity (LIP), cigarettes and also produces specialized papers for other applications, including low volume specialized commercial and industrial commodity paper grades produced, among other reasons, to maximize machine utilization. Its non-tobacco paper products include a mix of lightweight papers including low-volume, high-value, engineered materials, such as alkaline battery separator papers, as well as high-volume commodity paper grades for printing and writing, flooring laminates, and food service packaging, which are intended to maximize machine utilization. Its wet-laid paper making technologies include two main production processes: flat-wire production and incline-wire production. Its machines are flat-wire, meaning a liquid slurry of short pulp fibers and water are laid onto flat-wire conveyor belts, with the water draining through the wire as the fibers (wood, flax, tobacco) bond together to form a paper sheet. Incline-wire machines allow for increased drainage, enabling the use of longer fibers, which bond into a more open Web, increasing the porosity.The Company competes with delfortgroup AG, Miquel y Costas & Miquel S.A., Julius Glatz GmbH, PT Bukit Muria Jaya, Philip Morris-USA, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, JT, STMA (China) and Huabao International Holdings Ltd.Advanced Materials and StructuresThrough Advanced Materials & Structures (AMS) segment, the Company is a specialty producer of resin-based plastic netting through an extrusion process, as well as certain meltblown products, machined plastic core tubes, urethane films, and resin-based rolled products for use in other end segments, such as filtration, surface protection, medical and other industrials. The Company produces both tobacco-related papers and non-tobacco-related papers. The Company's tobacco-related papers include various porous papers used to wrap parts of a cigarette, such as tobacco column and filter, and reconstituted tobacco leaf (RTL), which is blended with virgin tobacco in a cigarette. The Company's non-tobacco paper products include a mix of lightweight papers, including low-volume engineered materials, such as alkaline battery separator papers, as well as high-volume commodity paper grades for printing and writing, flooring laminates, and food service packaging. The Company sells its products directly to the tobacco companies or their designated converters in the Americas, Europe and Asia. It manufactures its thermoplastic polyurethane films (TPU) to have combinations of the attributes, including ultraviolet (UV), scratch, and water resistance, breathability, and ultra-clarity. These products are also used in certain applications, such as graphics and laminated textiles in the industrial end-market, and also the medical end market.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 4    3.35      Net Money Flow ($)  677,760    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
