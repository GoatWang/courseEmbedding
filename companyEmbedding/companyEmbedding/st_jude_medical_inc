History[edit]
Early history[edit]
St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 to further develop bi-leaflet artificial heart valves, which were originally created in 1972 at the University of Minnesota.[4][5] St. Jude Medical's bi-leaflet valve was developed in large part by Dr. Demetre Nicoloff of the University of Minnesota and St. Jude Medical employee Don Hanson.[5]
Company founder Manny Villafana took St. Jude Medical public in February 1977.[4] In October of that year, Dr. Nicoloff implanted the company's first artificial heart valve in a human patient.[5] St. Jude Medical's new heart valve was coated in pyrolytic carbon, which helped the valve prevent blood clotting.[4][5]
St. Jude Medical founding chief operating officer LaVerne Rees became chief executive officer in 1981.[10] Shortly after his appointment as St. Jude Medical CEO, Rees directed the company to begin development of its own carbon coating.[4] This decision led to a legal battle with CarboMedics, the sole supplier of carbon coating for the company's heart valves.[11] The St. Jude Medical board reassigned Rees in late 1984 after the legal dispute continued.[4][12]
In 1985, Lawrence Lehmkuhl replaced Rees as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[13] Lehmkuhl had previously served as a division president at American Hospital Supply Corporation.[13] Shortly after the appointment, St. Jude Medical settled its lawsuit with CarboMedics.[14] The two companies also entered into an agreement that allowed St. Jude Medical to continue developing and producing limited quantities of its own carbon coating.[4]
In 1986, the first St. Jude Medical heart valve created with the company’s own carbon coating technology was implanted into a human in Germany.[4] Later that year, St. Jude Medical expanded into tissue heart valves with its acquisition of BioImplant.[4][15]
1990s[edit]
The company established its International Division, located in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. In April 1991, St. Jude Medical engaged in a joint venture with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to create Heart Valve Company.[16][17] The joint venture was formed to design and market new tissue heart valves for the American market.[16] The first Heart Valve Company tissue heart valve was implanted in a human patient in 1994.[16]
In March 1993, Ronald Matricaria, a former president of Eli Lilly & Company's North American division, replaced Lehmkuhl as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[18] Lehmkuhl, who had presided over a ninefold increase in annual sales during his tenure as CEO, was named chairman of the St. Jude Medical board.[18][19]
Matricaria pushed for increasing diversification and expanded St. Jude Medical's acquisition hunt.[4] In June 1994, the company announced that it would acquire the Pacesetter, Inc., the heart pacemaker division of Siemens AG, for $500 million.[20] At the time of its acquisition by St. Jude Medical, Pacesetter was the second largest pacemaker manufacturer worldwide.[20]
In January 1996, St. Jude Medical further diversified its business when it acquired Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Daig Corporation for $425 million.[21] Daig Corporation manufactured cardiac catheters for diagnostic and therapeutic uses.[21] Also in January of that year, St. Jude Medical became the sole owner of Heart Valve Company when it purchased Hancock Jaffe Laboratories' 50% share in the joint venture.[21] St. Jude Medical acquired Biocor Industria, a Brazilian manufacturer of tissue heart valves, in September 1996.[22]
In 1997, St. Jude Medical acquired Ventritex, a Sunnyvale, California-based manufacturer of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for $352 million.[23] At the time of its acquisition, Ventritex was the third-largest manufacturer of defibrillators.[23]
In February 1999, St. Jude Medical acquired Tyco International's Angio-Seal business.[24] Angio-Seal manufactured collagen-based plugs to close arterial holes made during arterial catheter procedures.[24] Matricaria stepped down as St. Jude Medical CEO in March 1999.[25] He was replaced by Terry Shepherd, who had served as president of St. Jude Medical's heart valve business since 1994.[25] Matricaria retained chairmanship of the St. Jude Medical board.[25]
2000s[edit]
In 2004, St. Jude Medical CEO Terry Shepherd retired.[26] The company's stock had increased 277% during his tenure as CEO.[26] St. Jude Medical COO Daniel Starks was appointed to replace Shepherd as the company's CEO.[26] Starks had previously served as chief executive officer of Daig Corporation from 1986-1996, when St. Jude Medical acquired the company.[26] Starks had been retained by St. Jude Medical and had served as company chief operating officer since 2001.[26]
In January 2005, St. Jude Medical acquired Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Endocardial Solutions for $272 million.[27] Endocardial Solutions manufactured diagnostic and therapeutic devices used to treat atrial fibrillation.[27] Later that year the company acquired Plano, Texas-based Advanced Neuromodulation Systems for $1.3 billion.[28] At the time of its acquisition, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems was the second-largest supplier of devices that use electrotherapy to treat chronic pain and nerve disorders.[28][29]
In 2008, St. Jude Medical acquired MediGuide, an Israeli company that developed technology that uses tiny sensors to locate medical devices inside of a patient's body and increase the amount of information available to a doctor during medical procedures.[30]
2010s[edit]
St. Jude Medical acquired AGA Medical for $1.3 billion in October 2010.[15] AGA Medical was a Plymouth, Minnesota-based company that manufactured products that treat heart defects, including plugs and patches that fix holes and other cardiac defects.[31][32] In 2010 the company also acquired LightLab Imaging, a company that developed optical coherence tomography technology that helps doctors treat heart disease.[33]
In 2010, St. Jude Medical invested in an option to acquire CardioMEMS Inc., a medical device company that developed a wireless sensing and communication technology to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in heart failure patients. CardioMEMS Inc. was acquired by St. Jude Medical in May 2014.[34][35]
In August 2012, St. Jude Medical reorganized its business operations.[36] The company folded its four product divisions into two operating units: the implantable electronic systems division; and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies division.[36] The company also centralized other functions including the marketing, information technology and legal departments.[36] St. Jude Medical's reorganization coincided with layoffs of about 5% of the company's global workforce.[36]
In 2013, St. Jude Medical acquired Endosense, a Swiss company that developed a catheter that measures the force a doctor places on a patient's heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure.[37] St. Jude Medical paid $130 million for the company.[37]
In June 2013, St. Jude Medical entered into a series of agreements under which the company made a $40 million equity investment in Spinal Modulation, Inc.[38] In May 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System.[39]
St. Jude Medical acquired Nanostim Inc., a Sunnyvale, California-based privately owned developer of miniaturized, leadless pacemakers, for $123.5 million in October 2013.[40] The acquisition followed the approval of Nanostim's leadless pacemaker by the European Union.[40] St. Jude Medical had secured the exclusive right to acquire Nanostim with a May 2011 investment in the start-up.[41]
St. Jude Medical continued the restructuring it started in 2014 with its consolidation of the company's two operating units—the implantable electronic systems and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies units—into single research and development division.[42] The company also consolidated its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations into a second division.[42]
In July 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire heart-device manufacturer Thoratec Corporation for $3.4 billion.[43] The acquisition was completed in October 2015.[44]
In September 2015, St. Jude Medical announced that Daniel Starks would retire as chairman, president, and chief executive officer. On January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau succeeded Starks as president, CEO and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of Directors. Starks would remain executive chairman of the board of directors.[9]
In late April 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion ($46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85 per share).[45][46]
On January 5th, 2017, Abbott announced that it had completed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical.

Operations[edit]
St. Jude Medical manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD); pacemakers; electrophysiology catheters; vascular closure products; cardiac mapping and visualization systems; optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems; structural heart repair products; and neurostimulation devices.[3] The company's operations are divided into two divisions: research and development; and manufacturing and supply chain.[47]
St. Jude Medical also operates six technology centers located in Brussels, Belgium, Beijing, China, Tokyo, Japan, Austin, Texas, St. Paul, Minnesota and Sylmar, California.[48][49][50] These centers offer training to physicians and allow them to simulate patient procedures using St. Jude Medical devices and technologies.[48][49]
Products[edit]
The company also manufactures the Assura line of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and implanted cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-Ds).[51][52] The ICDs and CRT-Ds use quadripolar lead technology, which utilizes four electrodes on a single lead to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart.[53]
In 2013, the company began marketing the Ilumen Optis device, which is a diagnostic and assessment tool for patients with coronary artery disease.[54] The device uses fractional flow reserve for measuring intra-arterial pressure and optical coherence tomography technology, which allows doctors to visually examine inside a patient's arteries.[55]
Technology[edit]
MediGuide[edit]
St. Jude Medical produces MediGuide, a cardiac navigation and visualization technology that provides real-time fluoroscopic images.[56][57] The system also gives doctors the ability to locate devices that are implanted with MediGuide-enabled sensors.[56][57] MediGuide reduces the duration of a patients' radiation exposure during cardiovascular procedures.[56][58]
Nanostim[edit]
In October 2013, the company acquired and began developing Nanostim leadless pacemakers. Nanostim technology consists of a miniaturized pacemaker implanted by a percutaneous, catheter-based procedure and placed into the heart. They are designed without the requirement for a lead, the thin wires inserted through a vein which connect the generator to the heart, or surgical pocket.[59]
CardioMEMS[edit]
In June 2014, St. Jude Medical acquired and began developing CardioMEMS HF System, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring technology. The wireless monitoring technology is used to assess cardiac performance via measurement of PAP and can be placed into the pulmonary artery.[60]
Controversies[edit]
In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped selling its Riata and Riata ST line of defibrillator leads over concerns that the leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion.[61][62] The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011.[62][63] In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor the performance of the Durata and Riata ST ICD leads.[64] The results of the analysis found that the insulated leads had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years.[64]
In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sent St. Jude Medical a warning letter detailing concerns regarding processes at the company's Sylmar, California facility.[65] The letter was sent following inspections of the plant in September and October 2012.[65] The letter did not raise any safety concerns about St. Jude Medical products.[65]
That same month the company sent the Food and Drug Administration a 34-page letter detailing the company's efforts to correct problems found during the October inspection.[66]
In 2014 a security vulnerability in St. Jude's pacemakers was reported by MedSec Holdings Ltd and confirmed by the FDA.[67]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 to further develop bi-leaflet artificial heart valves, which were originally created in 1972 at the University of Minnesota.[4][5] St. Jude Medical's bi-leaflet valve was developed in large part by Dr. Demetre Nicoloff of the University of Minnesota and St. Jude Medical employee Don Hanson.[5]
Company founder Manny Villafana took St. Jude Medical public in February 1977.[4] In October of that year, Dr. Nicoloff implanted the company's first artificial heart valve in a human patient.[5] St. Jude Medical's new heart valve was coated in pyrolytic carbon, which helped the valve prevent blood clotting.[4][5]
St. Jude Medical founding chief operating officer LaVerne Rees became chief executive officer in 1981.[10] Shortly after his appointment as St. Jude Medical CEO, Rees directed the company to begin development of its own carbon coating.[4] This decision led to a legal battle with CarboMedics, the sole supplier of carbon coating for the company's heart valves.[11] The St. Jude Medical board reassigned Rees in late 1984 after the legal dispute continued.[4][12]
In 1985, Lawrence Lehmkuhl replaced Rees as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[13] Lehmkuhl had previously served as a division president at American Hospital Supply Corporation.[13] Shortly after the appointment, St. Jude Medical settled its lawsuit with CarboMedics.[14] The two companies also entered into an agreement that allowed St. Jude Medical to continue developing and producing limited quantities of its own carbon coating.[4]
In 1986, the first St. Jude Medical heart valve created with the company’s own carbon coating technology was implanted into a human in Germany.[4] Later that year, St. Jude Medical expanded into tissue heart valves with its acquisition of BioImplant.[4][15]
1990s[edit]
The company established its International Division, located in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. In April 1991, St. Jude Medical engaged in a joint venture with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to create Heart Valve Company.[16][17] The joint venture was formed to design and market new tissue heart valves for the American market.[16] The first Heart Valve Company tissue heart valve was implanted in a human patient in 1994.[16]
In March 1993, Ronald Matricaria, a former president of Eli Lilly & Company's North American division, replaced Lehmkuhl as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[18] Lehmkuhl, who had presided over a ninefold increase in annual sales during his tenure as CEO, was named chairman of the St. Jude Medical board.[18][19]
Matricaria pushed for increasing diversification and expanded St. Jude Medical's acquisition hunt.[4] In June 1994, the company announced that it would acquire the Pacesetter, Inc., the heart pacemaker division of Siemens AG, for $500 million.[20] At the time of its acquisition by St. Jude Medical, Pacesetter was the second largest pacemaker manufacturer worldwide.[20]
In January 1996, St. Jude Medical further diversified its business when it acquired Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Daig Corporation for $425 million.[21] Daig Corporation manufactured cardiac catheters for diagnostic and therapeutic uses.[21] Also in January of that year, St. Jude Medical became the sole owner of Heart Valve Company when it purchased Hancock Jaffe Laboratories' 50% share in the joint venture.[21] St. Jude Medical acquired Biocor Industria, a Brazilian manufacturer of tissue heart valves, in September 1996.[22]
In 1997, St. Jude Medical acquired Ventritex, a Sunnyvale, California-based manufacturer of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for $352 million.[23] At the time of its acquisition, Ventritex was the third-largest manufacturer of defibrillators.[23]
In February 1999, St. Jude Medical acquired Tyco International's Angio-Seal business.[24] Angio-Seal manufactured collagen-based plugs to close arterial holes made during arterial catheter procedures.[24] Matricaria stepped down as St. Jude Medical CEO in March 1999.[25] He was replaced by Terry Shepherd, who had served as president of St. Jude Medical's heart valve business since 1994.[25] Matricaria retained chairmanship of the St. Jude Medical board.[25]
2000s[edit]
In 2004, St. Jude Medical CEO Terry Shepherd retired.[26] The company's stock had increased 277% during his tenure as CEO.[26] St. Jude Medical COO Daniel Starks was appointed to replace Shepherd as the company's CEO.[26] Starks had previously served as chief executive officer of Daig Corporation from 1986-1996, when St. Jude Medical acquired the company.[26] Starks had been retained by St. Jude Medical and had served as company chief operating officer since 2001.[26]
In January 2005, St. Jude Medical acquired Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Endocardial Solutions for $272 million.[27] Endocardial Solutions manufactured diagnostic and therapeutic devices used to treat atrial fibrillation.[27] Later that year the company acquired Plano, Texas-based Advanced Neuromodulation Systems for $1.3 billion.[28] At the time of its acquisition, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems was the second-largest supplier of devices that use electrotherapy to treat chronic pain and nerve disorders.[28][29]
In 2008, St. Jude Medical acquired MediGuide, an Israeli company that developed technology that uses tiny sensors to locate medical devices inside of a patient's body and increase the amount of information available to a doctor during medical procedures.[30]
2010s[edit]
St. Jude Medical acquired AGA Medical for $1.3 billion in October 2010.[15] AGA Medical was a Plymouth, Minnesota-based company that manufactured products that treat heart defects, including plugs and patches that fix holes and other cardiac defects.[31][32] In 2010 the company also acquired LightLab Imaging, a company that developed optical coherence tomography technology that helps doctors treat heart disease.[33]
In 2010, St. Jude Medical invested in an option to acquire CardioMEMS Inc., a medical device company that developed a wireless sensing and communication technology to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in heart failure patients. CardioMEMS Inc. was acquired by St. Jude Medical in May 2014.[34][35]
In August 2012, St. Jude Medical reorganized its business operations.[36] The company folded its four product divisions into two operating units: the implantable electronic systems division; and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies division.[36] The company also centralized other functions including the marketing, information technology and legal departments.[36] St. Jude Medical's reorganization coincided with layoffs of about 5% of the company's global workforce.[36]
In 2013, St. Jude Medical acquired Endosense, a Swiss company that developed a catheter that measures the force a doctor places on a patient's heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure.[37] St. Jude Medical paid $130 million for the company.[37]
In June 2013, St. Jude Medical entered into a series of agreements under which the company made a $40 million equity investment in Spinal Modulation, Inc.[38] In May 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System.[39]
St. Jude Medical acquired Nanostim Inc., a Sunnyvale, California-based privately owned developer of miniaturized, leadless pacemakers, for $123.5 million in October 2013.[40] The acquisition followed the approval of Nanostim's leadless pacemaker by the European Union.[40] St. Jude Medical had secured the exclusive right to acquire Nanostim with a May 2011 investment in the start-up.[41]
St. Jude Medical continued the restructuring it started in 2014 with its consolidation of the company's two operating units—the implantable electronic systems and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies units—into single research and development division.[42] The company also consolidated its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations into a second division.[42]
In July 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire heart-device manufacturer Thoratec Corporation for $3.4 billion.[43] The acquisition was completed in October 2015.[44]
In September 2015, St. Jude Medical announced that Daniel Starks would retire as chairman, president, and chief executive officer. On January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau succeeded Starks as president, CEO and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of Directors. Starks would remain executive chairman of the board of directors.[9]
In late April 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion ($46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85 per share).[45][46]
On January 5th, 2017, Abbott announced that it had completed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical.

Operations[edit]
St. Jude Medical manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD); pacemakers; electrophysiology catheters; vascular closure products; cardiac mapping and visualization systems; optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems; structural heart repair products; and neurostimulation devices.[3] The company's operations are divided into two divisions: research and development; and manufacturing and supply chain.[47]
St. Jude Medical also operates six technology centers located in Brussels, Belgium, Beijing, China, Tokyo, Japan, Austin, Texas, St. Paul, Minnesota and Sylmar, California.[48][49][50] These centers offer training to physicians and allow them to simulate patient procedures using St. Jude Medical devices and technologies.[48][49]
Products[edit]
The company also manufactures the Assura line of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and implanted cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-Ds).[51][52] The ICDs and CRT-Ds use quadripolar lead technology, which utilizes four electrodes on a single lead to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart.[53]
In 2013, the company began marketing the Ilumen Optis device, which is a diagnostic and assessment tool for patients with coronary artery disease.[54] The device uses fractional flow reserve for measuring intra-arterial pressure and optical coherence tomography technology, which allows doctors to visually examine inside a patient's arteries.[55]
Technology[edit]
MediGuide[edit]
St. Jude Medical produces MediGuide, a cardiac navigation and visualization technology that provides real-time fluoroscopic images.[56][57] The system also gives doctors the ability to locate devices that are implanted with MediGuide-enabled sensors.[56][57] MediGuide reduces the duration of a patients' radiation exposure during cardiovascular procedures.[56][58]
Nanostim[edit]
In October 2013, the company acquired and began developing Nanostim leadless pacemakers. Nanostim technology consists of a miniaturized pacemaker implanted by a percutaneous, catheter-based procedure and placed into the heart. They are designed without the requirement for a lead, the thin wires inserted through a vein which connect the generator to the heart, or surgical pocket.[59]
CardioMEMS[edit]
In June 2014, St. Jude Medical acquired and began developing CardioMEMS HF System, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring technology. The wireless monitoring technology is used to assess cardiac performance via measurement of PAP and can be placed into the pulmonary artery.[60]
Controversies[edit]
In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped selling its Riata and Riata ST line of defibrillator leads over concerns that the leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion.[61][62] The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011.[62][63] In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor the performance of the Durata and Riata ST ICD leads.[64] The results of the analysis found that the insulated leads had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years.[64]
In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sent St. Jude Medical a warning letter detailing concerns regarding processes at the company's Sylmar, California facility.[65] The letter was sent following inspections of the plant in September and October 2012.[65] The letter did not raise any safety concerns about St. Jude Medical products.[65]
That same month the company sent the Food and Drug Administration a 34-page letter detailing the company's efforts to correct problems found during the October inspection.[66]
In 2014 a security vulnerability in St. Jude's pacemakers was reported by MedSec Holdings Ltd and confirmed by the FDA.[67]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 to further develop bi-leaflet artificial heart valves, which were originally created in 1972 at the University of Minnesota.[4][5] St. Jude Medical's bi-leaflet valve was developed in large part by Dr. Demetre Nicoloff of the University of Minnesota and St. Jude Medical employee Don Hanson.[5]
Company founder Manny Villafana took St. Jude Medical public in February 1977.[4] In October of that year, Dr. Nicoloff implanted the company's first artificial heart valve in a human patient.[5] St. Jude Medical's new heart valve was coated in pyrolytic carbon, which helped the valve prevent blood clotting.[4][5]
St. Jude Medical founding chief operating officer LaVerne Rees became chief executive officer in 1981.[10] Shortly after his appointment as St. Jude Medical CEO, Rees directed the company to begin development of its own carbon coating.[4] This decision led to a legal battle with CarboMedics, the sole supplier of carbon coating for the company's heart valves.[11] The St. Jude Medical board reassigned Rees in late 1984 after the legal dispute continued.[4][12]
In 1985, Lawrence Lehmkuhl replaced Rees as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[13] Lehmkuhl had previously served as a division president at American Hospital Supply Corporation.[13] Shortly after the appointment, St. Jude Medical settled its lawsuit with CarboMedics.[14] The two companies also entered into an agreement that allowed St. Jude Medical to continue developing and producing limited quantities of its own carbon coating.[4]
In 1986, the first St. Jude Medical heart valve created with the company’s own carbon coating technology was implanted into a human in Germany.[4] Later that year, St. Jude Medical expanded into tissue heart valves with its acquisition of BioImplant.[4][15]
1990s[edit]
The company established its International Division, located in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. In April 1991, St. Jude Medical engaged in a joint venture with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to create Heart Valve Company.[16][17] The joint venture was formed to design and market new tissue heart valves for the American market.[16] The first Heart Valve Company tissue heart valve was implanted in a human patient in 1994.[16]
In March 1993, Ronald Matricaria, a former president of Eli Lilly & Company's North American division, replaced Lehmkuhl as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[18] Lehmkuhl, who had presided over a ninefold increase in annual sales during his tenure as CEO, was named chairman of the St. Jude Medical board.[18][19]
Matricaria pushed for increasing diversification and expanded St. Jude Medical's acquisition hunt.[4] In June 1994, the company announced that it would acquire the Pacesetter, Inc., the heart pacemaker division of Siemens AG, for $500 million.[20] At the time of its acquisition by St. Jude Medical, Pacesetter was the second largest pacemaker manufacturer worldwide.[20]
In January 1996, St. Jude Medical further diversified its business when it acquired Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Daig Corporation for $425 million.[21] Daig Corporation manufactured cardiac catheters for diagnostic and therapeutic uses.[21] Also in January of that year, St. Jude Medical became the sole owner of Heart Valve Company when it purchased Hancock Jaffe Laboratories' 50% share in the joint venture.[21] St. Jude Medical acquired Biocor Industria, a Brazilian manufacturer of tissue heart valves, in September 1996.[22]
In 1997, St. Jude Medical acquired Ventritex, a Sunnyvale, California-based manufacturer of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for $352 million.[23] At the time of its acquisition, Ventritex was the third-largest manufacturer of defibrillators.[23]
In February 1999, St. Jude Medical acquired Tyco International's Angio-Seal business.[24] Angio-Seal manufactured collagen-based plugs to close arterial holes made during arterial catheter procedures.[24] Matricaria stepped down as St. Jude Medical CEO in March 1999.[25] He was replaced by Terry Shepherd, who had served as president of St. Jude Medical's heart valve business since 1994.[25] Matricaria retained chairmanship of the St. Jude Medical board.[25]
2000s[edit]
In 2004, St. Jude Medical CEO Terry Shepherd retired.[26] The company's stock had increased 277% during his tenure as CEO.[26] St. Jude Medical COO Daniel Starks was appointed to replace Shepherd as the company's CEO.[26] Starks had previously served as chief executive officer of Daig Corporation from 1986-1996, when St. Jude Medical acquired the company.[26] Starks had been retained by St. Jude Medical and had served as company chief operating officer since 2001.[26]
In January 2005, St. Jude Medical acquired Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Endocardial Solutions for $272 million.[27] Endocardial Solutions manufactured diagnostic and therapeutic devices used to treat atrial fibrillation.[27] Later that year the company acquired Plano, Texas-based Advanced Neuromodulation Systems for $1.3 billion.[28] At the time of its acquisition, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems was the second-largest supplier of devices that use electrotherapy to treat chronic pain and nerve disorders.[28][29]
In 2008, St. Jude Medical acquired MediGuide, an Israeli company that developed technology that uses tiny sensors to locate medical devices inside of a patient's body and increase the amount of information available to a doctor during medical procedures.[30]
2010s[edit]
St. Jude Medical acquired AGA Medical for $1.3 billion in October 2010.[15] AGA Medical was a Plymouth, Minnesota-based company that manufactured products that treat heart defects, including plugs and patches that fix holes and other cardiac defects.[31][32] In 2010 the company also acquired LightLab Imaging, a company that developed optical coherence tomography technology that helps doctors treat heart disease.[33]
In 2010, St. Jude Medical invested in an option to acquire CardioMEMS Inc., a medical device company that developed a wireless sensing and communication technology to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in heart failure patients. CardioMEMS Inc. was acquired by St. Jude Medical in May 2014.[34][35]
In August 2012, St. Jude Medical reorganized its business operations.[36] The company folded its four product divisions into two operating units: the implantable electronic systems division; and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies division.[36] The company also centralized other functions including the marketing, information technology and legal departments.[36] St. Jude Medical's reorganization coincided with layoffs of about 5% of the company's global workforce.[36]
In 2013, St. Jude Medical acquired Endosense, a Swiss company that developed a catheter that measures the force a doctor places on a patient's heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure.[37] St. Jude Medical paid $130 million for the company.[37]
In June 2013, St. Jude Medical entered into a series of agreements under which the company made a $40 million equity investment in Spinal Modulation, Inc.[38] In May 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System.[39]
St. Jude Medical acquired Nanostim Inc., a Sunnyvale, California-based privately owned developer of miniaturized, leadless pacemakers, for $123.5 million in October 2013.[40] The acquisition followed the approval of Nanostim's leadless pacemaker by the European Union.[40] St. Jude Medical had secured the exclusive right to acquire Nanostim with a May 2011 investment in the start-up.[41]
St. Jude Medical continued the restructuring it started in 2014 with its consolidation of the company's two operating units—the implantable electronic systems and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies units—into single research and development division.[42] The company also consolidated its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations into a second division.[42]
In July 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire heart-device manufacturer Thoratec Corporation for $3.4 billion.[43] The acquisition was completed in October 2015.[44]
In September 2015, St. Jude Medical announced that Daniel Starks would retire as chairman, president, and chief executive officer. On January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau succeeded Starks as president, CEO and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of Directors. Starks would remain executive chairman of the board of directors.[9]
In late April 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion ($46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85 per share).[45][46]
On January 5th, 2017, Abbott announced that it had completed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical.

Operations[edit]
St. Jude Medical manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD); pacemakers; electrophysiology catheters; vascular closure products; cardiac mapping and visualization systems; optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems; structural heart repair products; and neurostimulation devices.[3] The company's operations are divided into two divisions: research and development; and manufacturing and supply chain.[47]
St. Jude Medical also operates six technology centers located in Brussels, Belgium, Beijing, China, Tokyo, Japan, Austin, Texas, St. Paul, Minnesota and Sylmar, California.[48][49][50] These centers offer training to physicians and allow them to simulate patient procedures using St. Jude Medical devices and technologies.[48][49]
Products[edit]
The company also manufactures the Assura line of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and implanted cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-Ds).[51][52] The ICDs and CRT-Ds use quadripolar lead technology, which utilizes four electrodes on a single lead to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart.[53]
In 2013, the company began marketing the Ilumen Optis device, which is a diagnostic and assessment tool for patients with coronary artery disease.[54] The device uses fractional flow reserve for measuring intra-arterial pressure and optical coherence tomography technology, which allows doctors to visually examine inside a patient's arteries.[55]
Technology[edit]
MediGuide[edit]
St. Jude Medical produces MediGuide, a cardiac navigation and visualization technology that provides real-time fluoroscopic images.[56][57] The system also gives doctors the ability to locate devices that are implanted with MediGuide-enabled sensors.[56][57] MediGuide reduces the duration of a patients' radiation exposure during cardiovascular procedures.[56][58]
Nanostim[edit]
In October 2013, the company acquired and began developing Nanostim leadless pacemakers. Nanostim technology consists of a miniaturized pacemaker implanted by a percutaneous, catheter-based procedure and placed into the heart. They are designed without the requirement for a lead, the thin wires inserted through a vein which connect the generator to the heart, or surgical pocket.[59]
CardioMEMS[edit]
In June 2014, St. Jude Medical acquired and began developing CardioMEMS HF System, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring technology. The wireless monitoring technology is used to assess cardiac performance via measurement of PAP and can be placed into the pulmonary artery.[60]
Controversies[edit]
In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped selling its Riata and Riata ST line of defibrillator leads over concerns that the leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion.[61][62] The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011.[62][63] In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor the performance of the Durata and Riata ST ICD leads.[64] The results of the analysis found that the insulated leads had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years.[64]
In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sent St. Jude Medical a warning letter detailing concerns regarding processes at the company's Sylmar, California facility.[65] The letter was sent following inspections of the plant in September and October 2012.[65] The letter did not raise any safety concerns about St. Jude Medical products.[65]
That same month the company sent the Food and Drug Administration a 34-page letter detailing the company's efforts to correct problems found during the October inspection.[66]
In 2014 a security vulnerability in St. Jude's pacemakers was reported by MedSec Holdings Ltd and confirmed by the FDA.[67]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 to further develop bi-leaflet artificial heart valves, which were originally created in 1972 at the University of Minnesota.[4][5] St. Jude Medical's bi-leaflet valve was developed in large part by Dr. Demetre Nicoloff of the University of Minnesota and St. Jude Medical employee Don Hanson.[5]
Company founder Manny Villafana took St. Jude Medical public in February 1977.[4] In October of that year, Dr. Nicoloff implanted the company's first artificial heart valve in a human patient.[5] St. Jude Medical's new heart valve was coated in pyrolytic carbon, which helped the valve prevent blood clotting.[4][5]
St. Jude Medical founding chief operating officer LaVerne Rees became chief executive officer in 1981.[10] Shortly after his appointment as St. Jude Medical CEO, Rees directed the company to begin development of its own carbon coating.[4] This decision led to a legal battle with CarboMedics, the sole supplier of carbon coating for the company's heart valves.[11] The St. Jude Medical board reassigned Rees in late 1984 after the legal dispute continued.[4][12]
In 1985, Lawrence Lehmkuhl replaced Rees as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[13] Lehmkuhl had previously served as a division president at American Hospital Supply Corporation.[13] Shortly after the appointment, St. Jude Medical settled its lawsuit with CarboMedics.[14] The two companies also entered into an agreement that allowed St. Jude Medical to continue developing and producing limited quantities of its own carbon coating.[4]
In 1986, the first St. Jude Medical heart valve created with the company’s own carbon coating technology was implanted into a human in Germany.[4] Later that year, St. Jude Medical expanded into tissue heart valves with its acquisition of BioImplant.[4][15]
1990s[edit]
The company established its International Division, located in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. In April 1991, St. Jude Medical engaged in a joint venture with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to create Heart Valve Company.[16][17] The joint venture was formed to design and market new tissue heart valves for the American market.[16] The first Heart Valve Company tissue heart valve was implanted in a human patient in 1994.[16]
In March 1993, Ronald Matricaria, a former president of Eli Lilly & Company's North American division, replaced Lehmkuhl as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[18] Lehmkuhl, who had presided over a ninefold increase in annual sales during his tenure as CEO, was named chairman of the St. Jude Medical board.[18][19]
Matricaria pushed for increasing diversification and expanded St. Jude Medical's acquisition hunt.[4] In June 1994, the company announced that it would acquire the Pacesetter, Inc., the heart pacemaker division of Siemens AG, for $500 million.[20] At the time of its acquisition by St. Jude Medical, Pacesetter was the second largest pacemaker manufacturer worldwide.[20]
In January 1996, St. Jude Medical further diversified its business when it acquired Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Daig Corporation for $425 million.[21] Daig Corporation manufactured cardiac catheters for diagnostic and therapeutic uses.[21] Also in January of that year, St. Jude Medical became the sole owner of Heart Valve Company when it purchased Hancock Jaffe Laboratories' 50% share in the joint venture.[21] St. Jude Medical acquired Biocor Industria, a Brazilian manufacturer of tissue heart valves, in September 1996.[22]
In 1997, St. Jude Medical acquired Ventritex, a Sunnyvale, California-based manufacturer of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for $352 million.[23] At the time of its acquisition, Ventritex was the third-largest manufacturer of defibrillators.[23]
In February 1999, St. Jude Medical acquired Tyco International's Angio-Seal business.[24] Angio-Seal manufactured collagen-based plugs to close arterial holes made during arterial catheter procedures.[24] Matricaria stepped down as St. Jude Medical CEO in March 1999.[25] He was replaced by Terry Shepherd, who had served as president of St. Jude Medical's heart valve business since 1994.[25] Matricaria retained chairmanship of the St. Jude Medical board.[25]
2000s[edit]
In 2004, St. Jude Medical CEO Terry Shepherd retired.[26] The company's stock had increased 277% during his tenure as CEO.[26] St. Jude Medical COO Daniel Starks was appointed to replace Shepherd as the company's CEO.[26] Starks had previously served as chief executive officer of Daig Corporation from 1986-1996, when St. Jude Medical acquired the company.[26] Starks had been retained by St. Jude Medical and had served as company chief operating officer since 2001.[26]
In January 2005, St. Jude Medical acquired Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Endocardial Solutions for $272 million.[27] Endocardial Solutions manufactured diagnostic and therapeutic devices used to treat atrial fibrillation.[27] Later that year the company acquired Plano, Texas-based Advanced Neuromodulation Systems for $1.3 billion.[28] At the time of its acquisition, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems was the second-largest supplier of devices that use electrotherapy to treat chronic pain and nerve disorders.[28][29]
In 2008, St. Jude Medical acquired MediGuide, an Israeli company that developed technology that uses tiny sensors to locate medical devices inside of a patient's body and increase the amount of information available to a doctor during medical procedures.[30]
2010s[edit]
St. Jude Medical acquired AGA Medical for $1.3 billion in October 2010.[15] AGA Medical was a Plymouth, Minnesota-based company that manufactured products that treat heart defects, including plugs and patches that fix holes and other cardiac defects.[31][32] In 2010 the company also acquired LightLab Imaging, a company that developed optical coherence tomography technology that helps doctors treat heart disease.[33]
In 2010, St. Jude Medical invested in an option to acquire CardioMEMS Inc., a medical device company that developed a wireless sensing and communication technology to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in heart failure patients. CardioMEMS Inc. was acquired by St. Jude Medical in May 2014.[34][35]
In August 2012, St. Jude Medical reorganized its business operations.[36] The company folded its four product divisions into two operating units: the implantable electronic systems division; and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies division.[36] The company also centralized other functions including the marketing, information technology and legal departments.[36] St. Jude Medical's reorganization coincided with layoffs of about 5% of the company's global workforce.[36]
In 2013, St. Jude Medical acquired Endosense, a Swiss company that developed a catheter that measures the force a doctor places on a patient's heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure.[37] St. Jude Medical paid $130 million for the company.[37]
In June 2013, St. Jude Medical entered into a series of agreements under which the company made a $40 million equity investment in Spinal Modulation, Inc.[38] In May 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System.[39]
St. Jude Medical acquired Nanostim Inc., a Sunnyvale, California-based privately owned developer of miniaturized, leadless pacemakers, for $123.5 million in October 2013.[40] The acquisition followed the approval of Nanostim's leadless pacemaker by the European Union.[40] St. Jude Medical had secured the exclusive right to acquire Nanostim with a May 2011 investment in the start-up.[41]
St. Jude Medical continued the restructuring it started in 2014 with its consolidation of the company's two operating units—the implantable electronic systems and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies units—into single research and development division.[42] The company also consolidated its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations into a second division.[42]
In July 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire heart-device manufacturer Thoratec Corporation for $3.4 billion.[43] The acquisition was completed in October 2015.[44]
In September 2015, St. Jude Medical announced that Daniel Starks would retire as chairman, president, and chief executive officer. On January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau succeeded Starks as president, CEO and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of Directors. Starks would remain executive chairman of the board of directors.[9]
In late April 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion ($46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85 per share).[45][46]
On January 5th, 2017, Abbott announced that it had completed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical.

Operations[edit]
St. Jude Medical manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD); pacemakers; electrophysiology catheters; vascular closure products; cardiac mapping and visualization systems; optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems; structural heart repair products; and neurostimulation devices.[3] The company's operations are divided into two divisions: research and development; and manufacturing and supply chain.[47]
St. Jude Medical also operates six technology centers located in Brussels, Belgium, Beijing, China, Tokyo, Japan, Austin, Texas, St. Paul, Minnesota and Sylmar, California.[48][49][50] These centers offer training to physicians and allow them to simulate patient procedures using St. Jude Medical devices and technologies.[48][49]
Products[edit]
The company also manufactures the Assura line of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and implanted cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-Ds).[51][52] The ICDs and CRT-Ds use quadripolar lead technology, which utilizes four electrodes on a single lead to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart.[53]
In 2013, the company began marketing the Ilumen Optis device, which is a diagnostic and assessment tool for patients with coronary artery disease.[54] The device uses fractional flow reserve for measuring intra-arterial pressure and optical coherence tomography technology, which allows doctors to visually examine inside a patient's arteries.[55]
Technology[edit]
MediGuide[edit]
St. Jude Medical produces MediGuide, a cardiac navigation and visualization technology that provides real-time fluoroscopic images.[56][57] The system also gives doctors the ability to locate devices that are implanted with MediGuide-enabled sensors.[56][57] MediGuide reduces the duration of a patients' radiation exposure during cardiovascular procedures.[56][58]
Nanostim[edit]
In October 2013, the company acquired and began developing Nanostim leadless pacemakers. Nanostim technology consists of a miniaturized pacemaker implanted by a percutaneous, catheter-based procedure and placed into the heart. They are designed without the requirement for a lead, the thin wires inserted through a vein which connect the generator to the heart, or surgical pocket.[59]
CardioMEMS[edit]
In June 2014, St. Jude Medical acquired and began developing CardioMEMS HF System, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring technology. The wireless monitoring technology is used to assess cardiac performance via measurement of PAP and can be placed into the pulmonary artery.[60]
Controversies[edit]
In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped selling its Riata and Riata ST line of defibrillator leads over concerns that the leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion.[61][62] The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011.[62][63] In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor the performance of the Durata and Riata ST ICD leads.[64] The results of the analysis found that the insulated leads had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years.[64]
In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sent St. Jude Medical a warning letter detailing concerns regarding processes at the company's Sylmar, California facility.[65] The letter was sent following inspections of the plant in September and October 2012.[65] The letter did not raise any safety concerns about St. Jude Medical products.[65]
That same month the company sent the Food and Drug Administration a 34-page letter detailing the company's efforts to correct problems found during the October inspection.[66]
In 2014 a security vulnerability in St. Jude's pacemakers was reported by MedSec Holdings Ltd and confirmed by the FDA.[67]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 to further develop bi-leaflet artificial heart valves, which were originally created in 1972 at the University of Minnesota.[4][5] St. Jude Medical's bi-leaflet valve was developed in large part by Dr. Demetre Nicoloff of the University of Minnesota and St. Jude Medical employee Don Hanson.[5]
Company founder Manny Villafana took St. Jude Medical public in February 1977.[4] In October of that year, Dr. Nicoloff implanted the company's first artificial heart valve in a human patient.[5] St. Jude Medical's new heart valve was coated in pyrolytic carbon, which helped the valve prevent blood clotting.[4][5]
St. Jude Medical founding chief operating officer LaVerne Rees became chief executive officer in 1981.[10] Shortly after his appointment as St. Jude Medical CEO, Rees directed the company to begin development of its own carbon coating.[4] This decision led to a legal battle with CarboMedics, the sole supplier of carbon coating for the company's heart valves.[11] The St. Jude Medical board reassigned Rees in late 1984 after the legal dispute continued.[4][12]
In 1985, Lawrence Lehmkuhl replaced Rees as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[13] Lehmkuhl had previously served as a division president at American Hospital Supply Corporation.[13] Shortly after the appointment, St. Jude Medical settled its lawsuit with CarboMedics.[14] The two companies also entered into an agreement that allowed St. Jude Medical to continue developing and producing limited quantities of its own carbon coating.[4]
In 1986, the first St. Jude Medical heart valve created with the company’s own carbon coating technology was implanted into a human in Germany.[4] Later that year, St. Jude Medical expanded into tissue heart valves with its acquisition of BioImplant.[4][15]
1990s[edit]
The company established its International Division, located in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. In April 1991, St. Jude Medical engaged in a joint venture with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to create Heart Valve Company.[16][17] The joint venture was formed to design and market new tissue heart valves for the American market.[16] The first Heart Valve Company tissue heart valve was implanted in a human patient in 1994.[16]
In March 1993, Ronald Matricaria, a former president of Eli Lilly & Company's North American division, replaced Lehmkuhl as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[18] Lehmkuhl, who had presided over a ninefold increase in annual sales during his tenure as CEO, was named chairman of the St. Jude Medical board.[18][19]
Matricaria pushed for increasing diversification and expanded St. Jude Medical's acquisition hunt.[4] In June 1994, the company announced that it would acquire the Pacesetter, Inc., the heart pacemaker division of Siemens AG, for $500 million.[20] At the time of its acquisition by St. Jude Medical, Pacesetter was the second largest pacemaker manufacturer worldwide.[20]
In January 1996, St. Jude Medical further diversified its business when it acquired Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Daig Corporation for $425 million.[21] Daig Corporation manufactured cardiac catheters for diagnostic and therapeutic uses.[21] Also in January of that year, St. Jude Medical became the sole owner of Heart Valve Company when it purchased Hancock Jaffe Laboratories' 50% share in the joint venture.[21] St. Jude Medical acquired Biocor Industria, a Brazilian manufacturer of tissue heart valves, in September 1996.[22]
In 1997, St. Jude Medical acquired Ventritex, a Sunnyvale, California-based manufacturer of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for $352 million.[23] At the time of its acquisition, Ventritex was the third-largest manufacturer of defibrillators.[23]
In February 1999, St. Jude Medical acquired Tyco International's Angio-Seal business.[24] Angio-Seal manufactured collagen-based plugs to close arterial holes made during arterial catheter procedures.[24] Matricaria stepped down as St. Jude Medical CEO in March 1999.[25] He was replaced by Terry Shepherd, who had served as president of St. Jude Medical's heart valve business since 1994.[25] Matricaria retained chairmanship of the St. Jude Medical board.[25]
2000s[edit]
In 2004, St. Jude Medical CEO Terry Shepherd retired.[26] The company's stock had increased 277% during his tenure as CEO.[26] St. Jude Medical COO Daniel Starks was appointed to replace Shepherd as the company's CEO.[26] Starks had previously served as chief executive officer of Daig Corporation from 1986-1996, when St. Jude Medical acquired the company.[26] Starks had been retained by St. Jude Medical and had served as company chief operating officer since 2001.[26]
In January 2005, St. Jude Medical acquired Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Endocardial Solutions for $272 million.[27] Endocardial Solutions manufactured diagnostic and therapeutic devices used to treat atrial fibrillation.[27] Later that year the company acquired Plano, Texas-based Advanced Neuromodulation Systems for $1.3 billion.[28] At the time of its acquisition, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems was the second-largest supplier of devices that use electrotherapy to treat chronic pain and nerve disorders.[28][29]
In 2008, St. Jude Medical acquired MediGuide, an Israeli company that developed technology that uses tiny sensors to locate medical devices inside of a patient's body and increase the amount of information available to a doctor during medical procedures.[30]
2010s[edit]
St. Jude Medical acquired AGA Medical for $1.3 billion in October 2010.[15] AGA Medical was a Plymouth, Minnesota-based company that manufactured products that treat heart defects, including plugs and patches that fix holes and other cardiac defects.[31][32] In 2010 the company also acquired LightLab Imaging, a company that developed optical coherence tomography technology that helps doctors treat heart disease.[33]
In 2010, St. Jude Medical invested in an option to acquire CardioMEMS Inc., a medical device company that developed a wireless sensing and communication technology to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in heart failure patients. CardioMEMS Inc. was acquired by St. Jude Medical in May 2014.[34][35]
In August 2012, St. Jude Medical reorganized its business operations.[36] The company folded its four product divisions into two operating units: the implantable electronic systems division; and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies division.[36] The company also centralized other functions including the marketing, information technology and legal departments.[36] St. Jude Medical's reorganization coincided with layoffs of about 5% of the company's global workforce.[36]
In 2013, St. Jude Medical acquired Endosense, a Swiss company that developed a catheter that measures the force a doctor places on a patient's heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure.[37] St. Jude Medical paid $130 million for the company.[37]
In June 2013, St. Jude Medical entered into a series of agreements under which the company made a $40 million equity investment in Spinal Modulation, Inc.[38] In May 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System.[39]
St. Jude Medical acquired Nanostim Inc., a Sunnyvale, California-based privately owned developer of miniaturized, leadless pacemakers, for $123.5 million in October 2013.[40] The acquisition followed the approval of Nanostim's leadless pacemaker by the European Union.[40] St. Jude Medical had secured the exclusive right to acquire Nanostim with a May 2011 investment in the start-up.[41]
St. Jude Medical continued the restructuring it started in 2014 with its consolidation of the company's two operating units—the implantable electronic systems and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies units—into single research and development division.[42] The company also consolidated its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations into a second division.[42]
In July 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire heart-device manufacturer Thoratec Corporation for $3.4 billion.[43] The acquisition was completed in October 2015.[44]
In September 2015, St. Jude Medical announced that Daniel Starks would retire as chairman, president, and chief executive officer. On January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau succeeded Starks as president, CEO and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of Directors. Starks would remain executive chairman of the board of directors.[9]
In late April 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion ($46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85 per share).[45][46]
On January 5th, 2017, Abbott announced that it had completed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical.

Operations[edit]
St. Jude Medical manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD); pacemakers; electrophysiology catheters; vascular closure products; cardiac mapping and visualization systems; optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems; structural heart repair products; and neurostimulation devices.[3] The company's operations are divided into two divisions: research and development; and manufacturing and supply chain.[47]
St. Jude Medical also operates six technology centers located in Brussels, Belgium, Beijing, China, Tokyo, Japan, Austin, Texas, St. Paul, Minnesota and Sylmar, California.[48][49][50] These centers offer training to physicians and allow them to simulate patient procedures using St. Jude Medical devices and technologies.[48][49]
Products[edit]
The company also manufactures the Assura line of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and implanted cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-Ds).[51][52] The ICDs and CRT-Ds use quadripolar lead technology, which utilizes four electrodes on a single lead to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart.[53]
In 2013, the company began marketing the Ilumen Optis device, which is a diagnostic and assessment tool for patients with coronary artery disease.[54] The device uses fractional flow reserve for measuring intra-arterial pressure and optical coherence tomography technology, which allows doctors to visually examine inside a patient's arteries.[55]
Technology[edit]
MediGuide[edit]
St. Jude Medical produces MediGuide, a cardiac navigation and visualization technology that provides real-time fluoroscopic images.[56][57] The system also gives doctors the ability to locate devices that are implanted with MediGuide-enabled sensors.[56][57] MediGuide reduces the duration of a patients' radiation exposure during cardiovascular procedures.[56][58]
Nanostim[edit]
In October 2013, the company acquired and began developing Nanostim leadless pacemakers. Nanostim technology consists of a miniaturized pacemaker implanted by a percutaneous, catheter-based procedure and placed into the heart. They are designed without the requirement for a lead, the thin wires inserted through a vein which connect the generator to the heart, or surgical pocket.[59]
CardioMEMS[edit]
In June 2014, St. Jude Medical acquired and began developing CardioMEMS HF System, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring technology. The wireless monitoring technology is used to assess cardiac performance via measurement of PAP and can be placed into the pulmonary artery.[60]
Controversies[edit]
In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped selling its Riata and Riata ST line of defibrillator leads over concerns that the leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion.[61][62] The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011.[62][63] In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor the performance of the Durata and Riata ST ICD leads.[64] The results of the analysis found that the insulated leads had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years.[64]
In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sent St. Jude Medical a warning letter detailing concerns regarding processes at the company's Sylmar, California facility.[65] The letter was sent following inspections of the plant in September and October 2012.[65] The letter did not raise any safety concerns about St. Jude Medical products.[65]
That same month the company sent the Food and Drug Administration a 34-page letter detailing the company's efforts to correct problems found during the October inspection.[66]
In 2014 a security vulnerability in St. Jude's pacemakers was reported by MedSec Holdings Ltd and confirmed by the FDA.[67]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 to further develop bi-leaflet artificial heart valves, which were originally created in 1972 at the University of Minnesota.[4][5] St. Jude Medical's bi-leaflet valve was developed in large part by Dr. Demetre Nicoloff of the University of Minnesota and St. Jude Medical employee Don Hanson.[5]
Company founder Manny Villafana took St. Jude Medical public in February 1977.[4] In October of that year, Dr. Nicoloff implanted the company's first artificial heart valve in a human patient.[5] St. Jude Medical's new heart valve was coated in pyrolytic carbon, which helped the valve prevent blood clotting.[4][5]
St. Jude Medical founding chief operating officer LaVerne Rees became chief executive officer in 1981.[10] Shortly after his appointment as St. Jude Medical CEO, Rees directed the company to begin development of its own carbon coating.[4] This decision led to a legal battle with CarboMedics, the sole supplier of carbon coating for the company's heart valves.[11] The St. Jude Medical board reassigned Rees in late 1984 after the legal dispute continued.[4][12]
In 1985, Lawrence Lehmkuhl replaced Rees as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[13] Lehmkuhl had previously served as a division president at American Hospital Supply Corporation.[13] Shortly after the appointment, St. Jude Medical settled its lawsuit with CarboMedics.[14] The two companies also entered into an agreement that allowed St. Jude Medical to continue developing and producing limited quantities of its own carbon coating.[4]
In 1986, the first St. Jude Medical heart valve created with the company’s own carbon coating technology was implanted into a human in Germany.[4] Later that year, St. Jude Medical expanded into tissue heart valves with its acquisition of BioImplant.[4][15]
1990s[edit]
The company established its International Division, located in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. In April 1991, St. Jude Medical engaged in a joint venture with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to create Heart Valve Company.[16][17] The joint venture was formed to design and market new tissue heart valves for the American market.[16] The first Heart Valve Company tissue heart valve was implanted in a human patient in 1994.[16]
In March 1993, Ronald Matricaria, a former president of Eli Lilly & Company's North American division, replaced Lehmkuhl as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[18] Lehmkuhl, who had presided over a ninefold increase in annual sales during his tenure as CEO, was named chairman of the St. Jude Medical board.[18][19]
Matricaria pushed for increasing diversification and expanded St. Jude Medical's acquisition hunt.[4] In June 1994, the company announced that it would acquire the Pacesetter, Inc., the heart pacemaker division of Siemens AG, for $500 million.[20] At the time of its acquisition by St. Jude Medical, Pacesetter was the second largest pacemaker manufacturer worldwide.[20]
In January 1996, St. Jude Medical further diversified its business when it acquired Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Daig Corporation for $425 million.[21] Daig Corporation manufactured cardiac catheters for diagnostic and therapeutic uses.[21] Also in January of that year, St. Jude Medical became the sole owner of Heart Valve Company when it purchased Hancock Jaffe Laboratories' 50% share in the joint venture.[21] St. Jude Medical acquired Biocor Industria, a Brazilian manufacturer of tissue heart valves, in September 1996.[22]
In 1997, St. Jude Medical acquired Ventritex, a Sunnyvale, California-based manufacturer of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for $352 million.[23] At the time of its acquisition, Ventritex was the third-largest manufacturer of defibrillators.[23]
In February 1999, St. Jude Medical acquired Tyco International's Angio-Seal business.[24] Angio-Seal manufactured collagen-based plugs to close arterial holes made during arterial catheter procedures.[24] Matricaria stepped down as St. Jude Medical CEO in March 1999.[25] He was replaced by Terry Shepherd, who had served as president of St. Jude Medical's heart valve business since 1994.[25] Matricaria retained chairmanship of the St. Jude Medical board.[25]
2000s[edit]
In 2004, St. Jude Medical CEO Terry Shepherd retired.[26] The company's stock had increased 277% during his tenure as CEO.[26] St. Jude Medical COO Daniel Starks was appointed to replace Shepherd as the company's CEO.[26] Starks had previously served as chief executive officer of Daig Corporation from 1986-1996, when St. Jude Medical acquired the company.[26] Starks had been retained by St. Jude Medical and had served as company chief operating officer since 2001.[26]
In January 2005, St. Jude Medical acquired Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Endocardial Solutions for $272 million.[27] Endocardial Solutions manufactured diagnostic and therapeutic devices used to treat atrial fibrillation.[27] Later that year the company acquired Plano, Texas-based Advanced Neuromodulation Systems for $1.3 billion.[28] At the time of its acquisition, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems was the second-largest supplier of devices that use electrotherapy to treat chronic pain and nerve disorders.[28][29]
In 2008, St. Jude Medical acquired MediGuide, an Israeli company that developed technology that uses tiny sensors to locate medical devices inside of a patient's body and increase the amount of information available to a doctor during medical procedures.[30]
2010s[edit]
St. Jude Medical acquired AGA Medical for $1.3 billion in October 2010.[15] AGA Medical was a Plymouth, Minnesota-based company that manufactured products that treat heart defects, including plugs and patches that fix holes and other cardiac defects.[31][32] In 2010 the company also acquired LightLab Imaging, a company that developed optical coherence tomography technology that helps doctors treat heart disease.[33]
In 2010, St. Jude Medical invested in an option to acquire CardioMEMS Inc., a medical device company that developed a wireless sensing and communication technology to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in heart failure patients. CardioMEMS Inc. was acquired by St. Jude Medical in May 2014.[34][35]
In August 2012, St. Jude Medical reorganized its business operations.[36] The company folded its four product divisions into two operating units: the implantable electronic systems division; and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies division.[36] The company also centralized other functions including the marketing, information technology and legal departments.[36] St. Jude Medical's reorganization coincided with layoffs of about 5% of the company's global workforce.[36]
In 2013, St. Jude Medical acquired Endosense, a Swiss company that developed a catheter that measures the force a doctor places on a patient's heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure.[37] St. Jude Medical paid $130 million for the company.[37]
In June 2013, St. Jude Medical entered into a series of agreements under which the company made a $40 million equity investment in Spinal Modulation, Inc.[38] In May 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System.[39]
St. Jude Medical acquired Nanostim Inc., a Sunnyvale, California-based privately owned developer of miniaturized, leadless pacemakers, for $123.5 million in October 2013.[40] The acquisition followed the approval of Nanostim's leadless pacemaker by the European Union.[40] St. Jude Medical had secured the exclusive right to acquire Nanostim with a May 2011 investment in the start-up.[41]
St. Jude Medical continued the restructuring it started in 2014 with its consolidation of the company's two operating units—the implantable electronic systems and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies units—into single research and development division.[42] The company also consolidated its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations into a second division.[42]
In July 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire heart-device manufacturer Thoratec Corporation for $3.4 billion.[43] The acquisition was completed in October 2015.[44]
In September 2015, St. Jude Medical announced that Daniel Starks would retire as chairman, president, and chief executive officer. On January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau succeeded Starks as president, CEO and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of Directors. Starks would remain executive chairman of the board of directors.[9]
In late April 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion ($46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85 per share).[45][46]
On January 5th, 2017, Abbott announced that it had completed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical.

Operations[edit]
St. Jude Medical manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD); pacemakers; electrophysiology catheters; vascular closure products; cardiac mapping and visualization systems; optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems; structural heart repair products; and neurostimulation devices.[3] The company's operations are divided into two divisions: research and development; and manufacturing and supply chain.[47]
St. Jude Medical also operates six technology centers located in Brussels, Belgium, Beijing, China, Tokyo, Japan, Austin, Texas, St. Paul, Minnesota and Sylmar, California.[48][49][50] These centers offer training to physicians and allow them to simulate patient procedures using St. Jude Medical devices and technologies.[48][49]
Products[edit]
The company also manufactures the Assura line of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and implanted cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-Ds).[51][52] The ICDs and CRT-Ds use quadripolar lead technology, which utilizes four electrodes on a single lead to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart.[53]
In 2013, the company began marketing the Ilumen Optis device, which is a diagnostic and assessment tool for patients with coronary artery disease.[54] The device uses fractional flow reserve for measuring intra-arterial pressure and optical coherence tomography technology, which allows doctors to visually examine inside a patient's arteries.[55]
Technology[edit]
MediGuide[edit]
St. Jude Medical produces MediGuide, a cardiac navigation and visualization technology that provides real-time fluoroscopic images.[56][57] The system also gives doctors the ability to locate devices that are implanted with MediGuide-enabled sensors.[56][57] MediGuide reduces the duration of a patients' radiation exposure during cardiovascular procedures.[56][58]
Nanostim[edit]
In October 2013, the company acquired and began developing Nanostim leadless pacemakers. Nanostim technology consists of a miniaturized pacemaker implanted by a percutaneous, catheter-based procedure and placed into the heart. They are designed without the requirement for a lead, the thin wires inserted through a vein which connect the generator to the heart, or surgical pocket.[59]
CardioMEMS[edit]
In June 2014, St. Jude Medical acquired and began developing CardioMEMS HF System, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring technology. The wireless monitoring technology is used to assess cardiac performance via measurement of PAP and can be placed into the pulmonary artery.[60]
Controversies[edit]
In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped selling its Riata and Riata ST line of defibrillator leads over concerns that the leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion.[61][62] The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011.[62][63] In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor the performance of the Durata and Riata ST ICD leads.[64] The results of the analysis found that the insulated leads had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years.[64]
In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sent St. Jude Medical a warning letter detailing concerns regarding processes at the company's Sylmar, California facility.[65] The letter was sent following inspections of the plant in September and October 2012.[65] The letter did not raise any safety concerns about St. Jude Medical products.[65]
That same month the company sent the Food and Drug Administration a 34-page letter detailing the company's efforts to correct problems found during the October inspection.[66]
In 2014 a security vulnerability in St. Jude's pacemakers was reported by MedSec Holdings Ltd and confirmed by the FDA.[67]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 to further develop bi-leaflet artificial heart valves, which were originally created in 1972 at the University of Minnesota.[4][5] St. Jude Medical's bi-leaflet valve was developed in large part by Dr. Demetre Nicoloff of the University of Minnesota and St. Jude Medical employee Don Hanson.[5]
Company founder Manny Villafana took St. Jude Medical public in February 1977.[4] In October of that year, Dr. Nicoloff implanted the company's first artificial heart valve in a human patient.[5] St. Jude Medical's new heart valve was coated in pyrolytic carbon, which helped the valve prevent blood clotting.[4][5]
St. Jude Medical founding chief operating officer LaVerne Rees became chief executive officer in 1981.[10] Shortly after his appointment as St. Jude Medical CEO, Rees directed the company to begin development of its own carbon coating.[4] This decision led to a legal battle with CarboMedics, the sole supplier of carbon coating for the company's heart valves.[11] The St. Jude Medical board reassigned Rees in late 1984 after the legal dispute continued.[4][12]
In 1985, Lawrence Lehmkuhl replaced Rees as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[13] Lehmkuhl had previously served as a division president at American Hospital Supply Corporation.[13] Shortly after the appointment, St. Jude Medical settled its lawsuit with CarboMedics.[14] The two companies also entered into an agreement that allowed St. Jude Medical to continue developing and producing limited quantities of its own carbon coating.[4]
In 1986, the first St. Jude Medical heart valve created with the company’s own carbon coating technology was implanted into a human in Germany.[4] Later that year, St. Jude Medical expanded into tissue heart valves with its acquisition of BioImplant.[4][15]
1990s[edit]
The company established its International Division, located in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. In April 1991, St. Jude Medical engaged in a joint venture with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to create Heart Valve Company.[16][17] The joint venture was formed to design and market new tissue heart valves for the American market.[16] The first Heart Valve Company tissue heart valve was implanted in a human patient in 1994.[16]
In March 1993, Ronald Matricaria, a former president of Eli Lilly & Company's North American division, replaced Lehmkuhl as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[18] Lehmkuhl, who had presided over a ninefold increase in annual sales during his tenure as CEO, was named chairman of the St. Jude Medical board.[18][19]
Matricaria pushed for increasing diversification and expanded St. Jude Medical's acquisition hunt.[4] In June 1994, the company announced that it would acquire the Pacesetter, Inc., the heart pacemaker division of Siemens AG, for $500 million.[20] At the time of its acquisition by St. Jude Medical, Pacesetter was the second largest pacemaker manufacturer worldwide.[20]
In January 1996, St. Jude Medical further diversified its business when it acquired Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Daig Corporation for $425 million.[21] Daig Corporation manufactured cardiac catheters for diagnostic and therapeutic uses.[21] Also in January of that year, St. Jude Medical became the sole owner of Heart Valve Company when it purchased Hancock Jaffe Laboratories' 50% share in the joint venture.[21] St. Jude Medical acquired Biocor Industria, a Brazilian manufacturer of tissue heart valves, in September 1996.[22]
In 1997, St. Jude Medical acquired Ventritex, a Sunnyvale, California-based manufacturer of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for $352 million.[23] At the time of its acquisition, Ventritex was the third-largest manufacturer of defibrillators.[23]
In February 1999, St. Jude Medical acquired Tyco International's Angio-Seal business.[24] Angio-Seal manufactured collagen-based plugs to close arterial holes made during arterial catheter procedures.[24] Matricaria stepped down as St. Jude Medical CEO in March 1999.[25] He was replaced by Terry Shepherd, who had served as president of St. Jude Medical's heart valve business since 1994.[25] Matricaria retained chairmanship of the St. Jude Medical board.[25]
2000s[edit]
In 2004, St. Jude Medical CEO Terry Shepherd retired.[26] The company's stock had increased 277% during his tenure as CEO.[26] St. Jude Medical COO Daniel Starks was appointed to replace Shepherd as the company's CEO.[26] Starks had previously served as chief executive officer of Daig Corporation from 1986-1996, when St. Jude Medical acquired the company.[26] Starks had been retained by St. Jude Medical and had served as company chief operating officer since 2001.[26]
In January 2005, St. Jude Medical acquired Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Endocardial Solutions for $272 million.[27] Endocardial Solutions manufactured diagnostic and therapeutic devices used to treat atrial fibrillation.[27] Later that year the company acquired Plano, Texas-based Advanced Neuromodulation Systems for $1.3 billion.[28] At the time of its acquisition, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems was the second-largest supplier of devices that use electrotherapy to treat chronic pain and nerve disorders.[28][29]
In 2008, St. Jude Medical acquired MediGuide, an Israeli company that developed technology that uses tiny sensors to locate medical devices inside of a patient's body and increase the amount of information available to a doctor during medical procedures.[30]
2010s[edit]
St. Jude Medical acquired AGA Medical for $1.3 billion in October 2010.[15] AGA Medical was a Plymouth, Minnesota-based company that manufactured products that treat heart defects, including plugs and patches that fix holes and other cardiac defects.[31][32] In 2010 the company also acquired LightLab Imaging, a company that developed optical coherence tomography technology that helps doctors treat heart disease.[33]
In 2010, St. Jude Medical invested in an option to acquire CardioMEMS Inc., a medical device company that developed a wireless sensing and communication technology to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in heart failure patients. CardioMEMS Inc. was acquired by St. Jude Medical in May 2014.[34][35]
In August 2012, St. Jude Medical reorganized its business operations.[36] The company folded its four product divisions into two operating units: the implantable electronic systems division; and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies division.[36] The company also centralized other functions including the marketing, information technology and legal departments.[36] St. Jude Medical's reorganization coincided with layoffs of about 5% of the company's global workforce.[36]
In 2013, St. Jude Medical acquired Endosense, a Swiss company that developed a catheter that measures the force a doctor places on a patient's heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure.[37] St. Jude Medical paid $130 million for the company.[37]
In June 2013, St. Jude Medical entered into a series of agreements under which the company made a $40 million equity investment in Spinal Modulation, Inc.[38] In May 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System.[39]
St. Jude Medical acquired Nanostim Inc., a Sunnyvale, California-based privately owned developer of miniaturized, leadless pacemakers, for $123.5 million in October 2013.[40] The acquisition followed the approval of Nanostim's leadless pacemaker by the European Union.[40] St. Jude Medical had secured the exclusive right to acquire Nanostim with a May 2011 investment in the start-up.[41]
St. Jude Medical continued the restructuring it started in 2014 with its consolidation of the company's two operating units—the implantable electronic systems and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies units—into single research and development division.[42] The company also consolidated its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations into a second division.[42]
In July 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire heart-device manufacturer Thoratec Corporation for $3.4 billion.[43] The acquisition was completed in October 2015.[44]
In September 2015, St. Jude Medical announced that Daniel Starks would retire as chairman, president, and chief executive officer. On January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau succeeded Starks as president, CEO and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of Directors. Starks would remain executive chairman of the board of directors.[9]
In late April 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion ($46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85 per share).[45][46]
On January 5th, 2017, Abbott announced that it had completed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical.

Operations[edit]
St. Jude Medical manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD); pacemakers; electrophysiology catheters; vascular closure products; cardiac mapping and visualization systems; optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems; structural heart repair products; and neurostimulation devices.[3] The company's operations are divided into two divisions: research and development; and manufacturing and supply chain.[47]
St. Jude Medical also operates six technology centers located in Brussels, Belgium, Beijing, China, Tokyo, Japan, Austin, Texas, St. Paul, Minnesota and Sylmar, California.[48][49][50] These centers offer training to physicians and allow them to simulate patient procedures using St. Jude Medical devices and technologies.[48][49]
Products[edit]
The company also manufactures the Assura line of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and implanted cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-Ds).[51][52] The ICDs and CRT-Ds use quadripolar lead technology, which utilizes four electrodes on a single lead to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart.[53]
In 2013, the company began marketing the Ilumen Optis device, which is a diagnostic and assessment tool for patients with coronary artery disease.[54] The device uses fractional flow reserve for measuring intra-arterial pressure and optical coherence tomography technology, which allows doctors to visually examine inside a patient's arteries.[55]
Technology[edit]
MediGuide[edit]
St. Jude Medical produces MediGuide, a cardiac navigation and visualization technology that provides real-time fluoroscopic images.[56][57] The system also gives doctors the ability to locate devices that are implanted with MediGuide-enabled sensors.[56][57] MediGuide reduces the duration of a patients' radiation exposure during cardiovascular procedures.[56][58]
Nanostim[edit]
In October 2013, the company acquired and began developing Nanostim leadless pacemakers. Nanostim technology consists of a miniaturized pacemaker implanted by a percutaneous, catheter-based procedure and placed into the heart. They are designed without the requirement for a lead, the thin wires inserted through a vein which connect the generator to the heart, or surgical pocket.[59]
CardioMEMS[edit]
In June 2014, St. Jude Medical acquired and began developing CardioMEMS HF System, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring technology. The wireless monitoring technology is used to assess cardiac performance via measurement of PAP and can be placed into the pulmonary artery.[60]
Controversies[edit]
In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped selling its Riata and Riata ST line of defibrillator leads over concerns that the leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion.[61][62] The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011.[62][63] In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor the performance of the Durata and Riata ST ICD leads.[64] The results of the analysis found that the insulated leads had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years.[64]
In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sent St. Jude Medical a warning letter detailing concerns regarding processes at the company's Sylmar, California facility.[65] The letter was sent following inspections of the plant in September and October 2012.[65] The letter did not raise any safety concerns about St. Jude Medical products.[65]
That same month the company sent the Food and Drug Administration a 34-page letter detailing the company's efforts to correct problems found during the October inspection.[66]
In 2014 a security vulnerability in St. Jude's pacemakers was reported by MedSec Holdings Ltd and confirmed by the FDA.[67]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 to further develop bi-leaflet artificial heart valves, which were originally created in 1972 at the University of Minnesota.[4][5] St. Jude Medical's bi-leaflet valve was developed in large part by Dr. Demetre Nicoloff of the University of Minnesota and St. Jude Medical employee Don Hanson.[5]
Company founder Manny Villafana took St. Jude Medical public in February 1977.[4] In October of that year, Dr. Nicoloff implanted the company's first artificial heart valve in a human patient.[5] St. Jude Medical's new heart valve was coated in pyrolytic carbon, which helped the valve prevent blood clotting.[4][5]
St. Jude Medical founding chief operating officer LaVerne Rees became chief executive officer in 1981.[10] Shortly after his appointment as St. Jude Medical CEO, Rees directed the company to begin development of its own carbon coating.[4] This decision led to a legal battle with CarboMedics, the sole supplier of carbon coating for the company's heart valves.[11] The St. Jude Medical board reassigned Rees in late 1984 after the legal dispute continued.[4][12]
In 1985, Lawrence Lehmkuhl replaced Rees as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[13] Lehmkuhl had previously served as a division president at American Hospital Supply Corporation.[13] Shortly after the appointment, St. Jude Medical settled its lawsuit with CarboMedics.[14] The two companies also entered into an agreement that allowed St. Jude Medical to continue developing and producing limited quantities of its own carbon coating.[4]
In 1986, the first St. Jude Medical heart valve created with the company’s own carbon coating technology was implanted into a human in Germany.[4] Later that year, St. Jude Medical expanded into tissue heart valves with its acquisition of BioImplant.[4][15]
1990s[edit]
The company established its International Division, located in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. In April 1991, St. Jude Medical engaged in a joint venture with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to create Heart Valve Company.[16][17] The joint venture was formed to design and market new tissue heart valves for the American market.[16] The first Heart Valve Company tissue heart valve was implanted in a human patient in 1994.[16]
In March 1993, Ronald Matricaria, a former president of Eli Lilly & Company's North American division, replaced Lehmkuhl as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[18] Lehmkuhl, who had presided over a ninefold increase in annual sales during his tenure as CEO, was named chairman of the St. Jude Medical board.[18][19]
Matricaria pushed for increasing diversification and expanded St. Jude Medical's acquisition hunt.[4] In June 1994, the company announced that it would acquire the Pacesetter, Inc., the heart pacemaker division of Siemens AG, for $500 million.[20] At the time of its acquisition by St. Jude Medical, Pacesetter was the second largest pacemaker manufacturer worldwide.[20]
In January 1996, St. Jude Medical further diversified its business when it acquired Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Daig Corporation for $425 million.[21] Daig Corporation manufactured cardiac catheters for diagnostic and therapeutic uses.[21] Also in January of that year, St. Jude Medical became the sole owner of Heart Valve Company when it purchased Hancock Jaffe Laboratories' 50% share in the joint venture.[21] St. Jude Medical acquired Biocor Industria, a Brazilian manufacturer of tissue heart valves, in September 1996.[22]
In 1997, St. Jude Medical acquired Ventritex, a Sunnyvale, California-based manufacturer of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for $352 million.[23] At the time of its acquisition, Ventritex was the third-largest manufacturer of defibrillators.[23]
In February 1999, St. Jude Medical acquired Tyco International's Angio-Seal business.[24] Angio-Seal manufactured collagen-based plugs to close arterial holes made during arterial catheter procedures.[24] Matricaria stepped down as St. Jude Medical CEO in March 1999.[25] He was replaced by Terry Shepherd, who had served as president of St. Jude Medical's heart valve business since 1994.[25] Matricaria retained chairmanship of the St. Jude Medical board.[25]
2000s[edit]
In 2004, St. Jude Medical CEO Terry Shepherd retired.[26] The company's stock had increased 277% during his tenure as CEO.[26] St. Jude Medical COO Daniel Starks was appointed to replace Shepherd as the company's CEO.[26] Starks had previously served as chief executive officer of Daig Corporation from 1986-1996, when St. Jude Medical acquired the company.[26] Starks had been retained by St. Jude Medical and had served as company chief operating officer since 2001.[26]
In January 2005, St. Jude Medical acquired Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Endocardial Solutions for $272 million.[27] Endocardial Solutions manufactured diagnostic and therapeutic devices used to treat atrial fibrillation.[27] Later that year the company acquired Plano, Texas-based Advanced Neuromodulation Systems for $1.3 billion.[28] At the time of its acquisition, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems was the second-largest supplier of devices that use electrotherapy to treat chronic pain and nerve disorders.[28][29]
In 2008, St. Jude Medical acquired MediGuide, an Israeli company that developed technology that uses tiny sensors to locate medical devices inside of a patient's body and increase the amount of information available to a doctor during medical procedures.[30]
2010s[edit]
St. Jude Medical acquired AGA Medical for $1.3 billion in October 2010.[15] AGA Medical was a Plymouth, Minnesota-based company that manufactured products that treat heart defects, including plugs and patches that fix holes and other cardiac defects.[31][32] In 2010 the company also acquired LightLab Imaging, a company that developed optical coherence tomography technology that helps doctors treat heart disease.[33]
In 2010, St. Jude Medical invested in an option to acquire CardioMEMS Inc., a medical device company that developed a wireless sensing and communication technology to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in heart failure patients. CardioMEMS Inc. was acquired by St. Jude Medical in May 2014.[34][35]
In August 2012, St. Jude Medical reorganized its business operations.[36] The company folded its four product divisions into two operating units: the implantable electronic systems division; and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies division.[36] The company also centralized other functions including the marketing, information technology and legal departments.[36] St. Jude Medical's reorganization coincided with layoffs of about 5% of the company's global workforce.[36]
In 2013, St. Jude Medical acquired Endosense, a Swiss company that developed a catheter that measures the force a doctor places on a patient's heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure.[37] St. Jude Medical paid $130 million for the company.[37]
In June 2013, St. Jude Medical entered into a series of agreements under which the company made a $40 million equity investment in Spinal Modulation, Inc.[38] In May 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System.[39]
St. Jude Medical acquired Nanostim Inc., a Sunnyvale, California-based privately owned developer of miniaturized, leadless pacemakers, for $123.5 million in October 2013.[40] The acquisition followed the approval of Nanostim's leadless pacemaker by the European Union.[40] St. Jude Medical had secured the exclusive right to acquire Nanostim with a May 2011 investment in the start-up.[41]
St. Jude Medical continued the restructuring it started in 2014 with its consolidation of the company's two operating units—the implantable electronic systems and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies units—into single research and development division.[42] The company also consolidated its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations into a second division.[42]
In July 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire heart-device manufacturer Thoratec Corporation for $3.4 billion.[43] The acquisition was completed in October 2015.[44]
In September 2015, St. Jude Medical announced that Daniel Starks would retire as chairman, president, and chief executive officer. On January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau succeeded Starks as president, CEO and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of Directors. Starks would remain executive chairman of the board of directors.[9]
In late April 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion ($46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85 per share).[45][46]
On January 5th, 2017, Abbott announced that it had completed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical.

Operations[edit]
St. Jude Medical manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD); pacemakers; electrophysiology catheters; vascular closure products; cardiac mapping and visualization systems; optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems; structural heart repair products; and neurostimulation devices.[3] The company's operations are divided into two divisions: research and development; and manufacturing and supply chain.[47]
St. Jude Medical also operates six technology centers located in Brussels, Belgium, Beijing, China, Tokyo, Japan, Austin, Texas, St. Paul, Minnesota and Sylmar, California.[48][49][50] These centers offer training to physicians and allow them to simulate patient procedures using St. Jude Medical devices and technologies.[48][49]
Products[edit]
The company also manufactures the Assura line of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and implanted cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-Ds).[51][52] The ICDs and CRT-Ds use quadripolar lead technology, which utilizes four electrodes on a single lead to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart.[53]
In 2013, the company began marketing the Ilumen Optis device, which is a diagnostic and assessment tool for patients with coronary artery disease.[54] The device uses fractional flow reserve for measuring intra-arterial pressure and optical coherence tomography technology, which allows doctors to visually examine inside a patient's arteries.[55]
Technology[edit]
MediGuide[edit]
St. Jude Medical produces MediGuide, a cardiac navigation and visualization technology that provides real-time fluoroscopic images.[56][57] The system also gives doctors the ability to locate devices that are implanted with MediGuide-enabled sensors.[56][57] MediGuide reduces the duration of a patients' radiation exposure during cardiovascular procedures.[56][58]
Nanostim[edit]
In October 2013, the company acquired and began developing Nanostim leadless pacemakers. Nanostim technology consists of a miniaturized pacemaker implanted by a percutaneous, catheter-based procedure and placed into the heart. They are designed without the requirement for a lead, the thin wires inserted through a vein which connect the generator to the heart, or surgical pocket.[59]
CardioMEMS[edit]
In June 2014, St. Jude Medical acquired and began developing CardioMEMS HF System, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring technology. The wireless monitoring technology is used to assess cardiac performance via measurement of PAP and can be placed into the pulmonary artery.[60]
Controversies[edit]
In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped selling its Riata and Riata ST line of defibrillator leads over concerns that the leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion.[61][62] The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011.[62][63] In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor the performance of the Durata and Riata ST ICD leads.[64] The results of the analysis found that the insulated leads had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years.[64]
In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sent St. Jude Medical a warning letter detailing concerns regarding processes at the company's Sylmar, California facility.[65] The letter was sent following inspections of the plant in September and October 2012.[65] The letter did not raise any safety concerns about St. Jude Medical products.[65]
That same month the company sent the Food and Drug Administration a 34-page letter detailing the company's efforts to correct problems found during the October inspection.[66]
In 2014 a security vulnerability in St. Jude's pacemakers was reported by MedSec Holdings Ltd and confirmed by the FDA.[67]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 to further develop bi-leaflet artificial heart valves, which were originally created in 1972 at the University of Minnesota.[4][5] St. Jude Medical's bi-leaflet valve was developed in large part by Dr. Demetre Nicoloff of the University of Minnesota and St. Jude Medical employee Don Hanson.[5]
Company founder Manny Villafana took St. Jude Medical public in February 1977.[4] In October of that year, Dr. Nicoloff implanted the company's first artificial heart valve in a human patient.[5] St. Jude Medical's new heart valve was coated in pyrolytic carbon, which helped the valve prevent blood clotting.[4][5]
St. Jude Medical founding chief operating officer LaVerne Rees became chief executive officer in 1981.[10] Shortly after his appointment as St. Jude Medical CEO, Rees directed the company to begin development of its own carbon coating.[4] This decision led to a legal battle with CarboMedics, the sole supplier of carbon coating for the company's heart valves.[11] The St. Jude Medical board reassigned Rees in late 1984 after the legal dispute continued.[4][12]
In 1985, Lawrence Lehmkuhl replaced Rees as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[13] Lehmkuhl had previously served as a division president at American Hospital Supply Corporation.[13] Shortly after the appointment, St. Jude Medical settled its lawsuit with CarboMedics.[14] The two companies also entered into an agreement that allowed St. Jude Medical to continue developing and producing limited quantities of its own carbon coating.[4]
In 1986, the first St. Jude Medical heart valve created with the company’s own carbon coating technology was implanted into a human in Germany.[4] Later that year, St. Jude Medical expanded into tissue heart valves with its acquisition of BioImplant.[4][15]
1990s[edit]
The company established its International Division, located in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. In April 1991, St. Jude Medical engaged in a joint venture with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to create Heart Valve Company.[16][17] The joint venture was formed to design and market new tissue heart valves for the American market.[16] The first Heart Valve Company tissue heart valve was implanted in a human patient in 1994.[16]
In March 1993, Ronald Matricaria, a former president of Eli Lilly & Company's North American division, replaced Lehmkuhl as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical.[18] Lehmkuhl, who had presided over a ninefold increase in annual sales during his tenure as CEO, was named chairman of the St. Jude Medical board.[18][19]
Matricaria pushed for increasing diversification and expanded St. Jude Medical's acquisition hunt.[4] In June 1994, the company announced that it would acquire the Pacesetter, Inc., the heart pacemaker division of Siemens AG, for $500 million.[20] At the time of its acquisition by St. Jude Medical, Pacesetter was the second largest pacemaker manufacturer worldwide.[20]
In January 1996, St. Jude Medical further diversified its business when it acquired Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Daig Corporation for $425 million.[21] Daig Corporation manufactured cardiac catheters for diagnostic and therapeutic uses.[21] Also in January of that year, St. Jude Medical became the sole owner of Heart Valve Company when it purchased Hancock Jaffe Laboratories' 50% share in the joint venture.[21] St. Jude Medical acquired Biocor Industria, a Brazilian manufacturer of tissue heart valves, in September 1996.[22]
In 1997, St. Jude Medical acquired Ventritex, a Sunnyvale, California-based manufacturer of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for $352 million.[23] At the time of its acquisition, Ventritex was the third-largest manufacturer of defibrillators.[23]
In February 1999, St. Jude Medical acquired Tyco International's Angio-Seal business.[24] Angio-Seal manufactured collagen-based plugs to close arterial holes made during arterial catheter procedures.[24] Matricaria stepped down as St. Jude Medical CEO in March 1999.[25] He was replaced by Terry Shepherd, who had served as president of St. Jude Medical's heart valve business since 1994.[25] Matricaria retained chairmanship of the St. Jude Medical board.[25]
2000s[edit]
In 2004, St. Jude Medical CEO Terry Shepherd retired.[26] The company's stock had increased 277% during his tenure as CEO.[26] St. Jude Medical COO Daniel Starks was appointed to replace Shepherd as the company's CEO.[26] Starks had previously served as chief executive officer of Daig Corporation from 1986-1996, when St. Jude Medical acquired the company.[26] Starks had been retained by St. Jude Medical and had served as company chief operating officer since 2001.[26]
In January 2005, St. Jude Medical acquired Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Endocardial Solutions for $272 million.[27] Endocardial Solutions manufactured diagnostic and therapeutic devices used to treat atrial fibrillation.[27] Later that year the company acquired Plano, Texas-based Advanced Neuromodulation Systems for $1.3 billion.[28] At the time of its acquisition, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems was the second-largest supplier of devices that use electrotherapy to treat chronic pain and nerve disorders.[28][29]
In 2008, St. Jude Medical acquired MediGuide, an Israeli company that developed technology that uses tiny sensors to locate medical devices inside of a patient's body and increase the amount of information available to a doctor during medical procedures.[30]
2010s[edit]
St. Jude Medical acquired AGA Medical for $1.3 billion in October 2010.[15] AGA Medical was a Plymouth, Minnesota-based company that manufactured products that treat heart defects, including plugs and patches that fix holes and other cardiac defects.[31][32] In 2010 the company also acquired LightLab Imaging, a company that developed optical coherence tomography technology that helps doctors treat heart disease.[33]
In 2010, St. Jude Medical invested in an option to acquire CardioMEMS Inc., a medical device company that developed a wireless sensing and communication technology to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in heart failure patients. CardioMEMS Inc. was acquired by St. Jude Medical in May 2014.[34][35]
In August 2012, St. Jude Medical reorganized its business operations.[36] The company folded its four product divisions into two operating units: the implantable electronic systems division; and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies division.[36] The company also centralized other functions including the marketing, information technology and legal departments.[36] St. Jude Medical's reorganization coincided with layoffs of about 5% of the company's global workforce.[36]
In 2013, St. Jude Medical acquired Endosense, a Swiss company that developed a catheter that measures the force a doctor places on a patient's heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure.[37] St. Jude Medical paid $130 million for the company.[37]
In June 2013, St. Jude Medical entered into a series of agreements under which the company made a $40 million equity investment in Spinal Modulation, Inc.[38] In May 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System.[39]
St. Jude Medical acquired Nanostim Inc., a Sunnyvale, California-based privately owned developer of miniaturized, leadless pacemakers, for $123.5 million in October 2013.[40] The acquisition followed the approval of Nanostim's leadless pacemaker by the European Union.[40] St. Jude Medical had secured the exclusive right to acquire Nanostim with a May 2011 investment in the start-up.[41]
St. Jude Medical continued the restructuring it started in 2014 with its consolidation of the company's two operating units—the implantable electronic systems and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies units—into single research and development division.[42] The company also consolidated its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations into a second division.[42]
In July 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire heart-device manufacturer Thoratec Corporation for $3.4 billion.[43] The acquisition was completed in October 2015.[44]
In September 2015, St. Jude Medical announced that Daniel Starks would retire as chairman, president, and chief executive officer. On January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau succeeded Starks as president, CEO and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of Directors. Starks would remain executive chairman of the board of directors.[9]
In late April 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion ($46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85 per share).[45][46]
On January 5th, 2017, Abbott announced that it had completed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical.

Operations[edit]
St. Jude Medical manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD); pacemakers; electrophysiology catheters; vascular closure products; cardiac mapping and visualization systems; optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems; structural heart repair products; and neurostimulation devices.[3] The company's operations are divided into two divisions: research and development; and manufacturing and supply chain.[47]
St. Jude Medical also operates six technology centers located in Brussels, Belgium, Beijing, China, Tokyo, Japan, Austin, Texas, St. Paul, Minnesota and Sylmar, California.[48][49][50] These centers offer training to physicians and allow them to simulate patient procedures using St. Jude Medical devices and technologies.[48][49]
Products[edit]
The company also manufactures the Assura line of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and implanted cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-Ds).[51][52] The ICDs and CRT-Ds use quadripolar lead technology, which utilizes four electrodes on a single lead to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart.[53]
In 2013, the company began marketing the Ilumen Optis device, which is a diagnostic and assessment tool for patients with coronary artery disease.[54] The device uses fractional flow reserve for measuring intra-arterial pressure and optical coherence tomography technology, which allows doctors to visually examine inside a patient's arteries.[55]
Technology[edit]
MediGuide[edit]
St. Jude Medical produces MediGuide, a cardiac navigation and visualization technology that provides real-time fluoroscopic images.[56][57] The system also gives doctors the ability to locate devices that are implanted with MediGuide-enabled sensors.[56][57] MediGuide reduces the duration of a patients' radiation exposure during cardiovascular procedures.[56][58]
Nanostim[edit]
In October 2013, the company acquired and began developing Nanostim leadless pacemakers. Nanostim technology consists of a miniaturized pacemaker implanted by a percutaneous, catheter-based procedure and placed into the heart. They are designed without the requirement for a lead, the thin wires inserted through a vein which connect the generator to the heart, or surgical pocket.[59]
CardioMEMS[edit]
In June 2014, St. Jude Medical acquired and began developing CardioMEMS HF System, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring technology. The wireless monitoring technology is used to assess cardiac performance via measurement of PAP and can be placed into the pulmonary artery.[60]
Controversies[edit]
In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped selling its Riata and Riata ST line of defibrillator leads over concerns that the leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion.[61][62] The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011.[62][63] In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor the performance of the Durata and Riata ST ICD leads.[64] The results of the analysis found that the insulated leads had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years.[64]
In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sent St. Jude Medical a warning letter detailing concerns regarding processes at the company's Sylmar, California facility.[65] The letter was sent following inspections of the plant in September and October 2012.[65] The letter did not raise any safety concerns about St. Jude Medical products.[65]
That same month the company sent the Food and Drug Administration a 34-page letter detailing the company's efforts to correct problems found during the October inspection.[66]
In 2014 a security vulnerability in St. Jude's pacemakers was reported by MedSec Holdings Ltd and confirmed by the FDA.[67]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

HEART FAILURE


Our focus is on developing comprehensive solutions for treating heart failure, which affects more than 26 million people around the world. A cornerstone of our heart failure portfolio is our left ventricular assist device: a mechanical pump that supports patients living with advanced heart failure or who are awaiting heart transplantation. Our pulmonary artery pressure monitoring system is an implantable sensor that enables early detection of worsening heart failure to physicians. By offering a full spectrum of heart failure solutions — diagnostics, devices, data and analytics — we can help manage heart failure more holistically, and improve outcomes for patients.
Heart failure management products




CARDIAC RHYTHM MANAGEMENT


Hearts that beat too fast, too slow, or out of sync pump blood less effectively and create a lack of blood flow that can damage the brain, heart and other organs. Abbott now has a full offering of innovative devices to keep the heart beating at a healthy pace – including pacemakers that send low-energy pulses to the heart to restore its normal rhythm, implantable cardiac defibrillators that help slow abnormally fast beating hearts, and cardiac resynchronization devices that help the heart pump in a more coordinated way.
Cardiac rhythm management products




NEUROMODULATION


Abbott now has one of the most advanced offerings of specialized devices for people suffering from chronic pain and movement disorders, so they can live more active, full lives. Our solutions include spinal cord stimulation and dorsal root ganglion therapy for targeted pain syndromes and deep brain stimulation for movement disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease.

      10903 New Hampshire AvenueSilver Spring, MD  20993  WARNING LETTER  VIA UNITED PARCEL SERVICE                                  April 12, 2017 Mike RousseauPresidentAbbottCardiovascular and Neuromodulation15900 Valley View CourtSylmar, California 91342-3577   Dear Mr. Rousseau: During an inspection of your firm located in Sylmar, CA,on February 7 through February 17, 2017, investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm manufactures the Fortify, Unify, Assura (including Quadra) implantable cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, and the Merlin@home monitor.  Under section 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body. This inspection revealed that these devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(h), in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, packing, storage, or installation are not in conformity with the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the Quality System (QS) regulation found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 820. We received a response from Vishnu Charan, Vice President of Operations, dated March 13, 2017, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483 (FDA 483), List of Inspectional Observations that was issued to your firm. We address this response below, in relation to each of the noted violations. These violations include, but are not limited to, the following: 1.      Failure to establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive actions, as required by 21 CFR 820.100(a). For example: a.  FDA reviewed 42 of your firm’s Product Analysis Reports, produced between 2011 and 2014. These reports showed, in instances when your supplier’s analysis provided evidence that lithium cluster bridging had prematurely drained the battery, your firm repeatedly concluded that the cause of premature depletion of Greatbatch QHR2850 batteries “could not be determined.”  Your firm later categorized these as “unconfirmed” lithium bridges. Your firm’s Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) Procedure, (b)(4), Revision AA states, in Section 2.0, the level of corrective action and preventive action shall be commensurate with the significance and risk of the nonconformance. Further, Section 5.0 states the risk evaluation of nonconformances is based on three factors: severity, probability, and detectability.   By basing your firm’s risk evaluation on “confirmed” cases and not considering the potential for “unconfirmed” cases to have been shorts, your firm underestimated the occurrence of the hazardous situation. This delayed initiation of CAPA #13-017 Titled: Lithium Clusters Shorts in M2850 Cells, until December 18, 2013, and your firm continued to distribute devices containing this battery until October 2016. The adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time. Your firm provided a summary of, and implementation dates for, several corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions. However, in your firm’s response, you failed to provide evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions.  b.  Section 5 of both your SJM Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) SOP, (b)(4),  Revision D, and SJM Corrective and Preventive Action WI, (b)(4),  Revision C, defines your firm’s CAPA process and the supporting procedures and forms associated with activities performed within your firm’s CAPA process. Additionally, Figure 2 in your firm’s SJM Corrective and Preventive Action WI, (b)(4),  Revision C, describes the CAPA Risk Assessment and Resolution Process that proceeds after a CAPA file is opened.  Your firm failed to follow its CAPA procedures when evaluating a third party report, dated August 25, 2016, in that your firm released Merlin@home Cybersecurity Risk Assessment (b)(4), , Revision G, an updated risk assessment and its corresponding corrective action, Merlin@home EX2000 v.8.2.2, (pilot release on December 7, 2016 with full release on January 9, 2017), before approving the CAPA request for this issue, CAPA#17012 Titled: CRM Product Cybersecurity, on February 7, 2017.  Your firm conducted a risk assessment and a corrective action outside of your CAPA system. Your firm did not confirm all required corrective and preventive actions were completed, including a full root cause investigation and the identification of actions to correct and prevent recurrence of potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities, as required by your CAPA procedures. Additionally, your firm did not confirm that verification or validation activities for the corrective actions had been completed, to ensure the corrective actions were effective and did not adversely affect the finished device. We have reviewed your response and conclude that it is not adequate.  Your firm provided a summary of and implementation dates for several corrections, and corrective actions. However, in your firm’s response, you failed to consider systemic corrective actions and the necessary information to include evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions.  c.  Your management review and medical advisory boards did not receive relevant and complete information concerning the premature battery depletion issue, as required by Section 5.3 your firm’s procedure, Quality Management Review SOP (b)(4),  Revision R. On November 11 and November 12, 2014, two separate presentations were provided for management review and to your MAB for review concerning premature battery depletions. The presentation to your firm’s MAB included rates of occurrence of premature battery depletions caused by “confirmed” lithium cluster formations. The presentation did not include information on the potential for “unconfirmed” cases to be shorts, despite possessing evidence provided by your supplier regarding premature battery depletion caused by lithium bridges. This resulted in significant underestimations of the probability of occurrence of the hazardous situation. Additionally, both presentations stated there were no serious injury or death directly related to lithium cluster formations. However, the first related death to this issue occurred on (b)(6) (MDR#2938836-2014-13599). Your firm completed its returned device analysis, related to this death, on August 27, 2014. The analysis concluded the cause of premature battery depletion “could not be determined” despite evidence of lithium bridges, provided by your supplier. This death was not disclosed in these presentations for management or MAB review.  We have reviewed your response and conclude that it is not adequate. Your firm provided a summary of and implementation dates for several corrections, and corrective actions. However, in your firm’s response, you failed to consider systemic corrective actions and the necessary information to include evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions.  2.      Failure to establish and maintain procedures to control product that does not conform to specified requirements, as required by 21 CFR 820.90(a).   For example: On October 11, 2016,  your firm initiated a recall for your firm’s Fortify, Unify, and Assura Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs) and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Defibrillators (CRT-Ds) due to premature battery depletion. Subsequently, ten implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs), subject to this recall, were shipped from your firm’s distribution centers to St. Jude US Field Representatives. Between October 14 and October 26, 2016, an additional seven ICDs, also subject to this recall and in the control of St. Jude US Field Representatives, were implanted into patients.    The adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time.  Your firm provided a summary of, and implementation dates for, several corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions. However, in your firm’s response, you failed to provide evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions.  3.      Failure to ensure that design verification shall confirm that the design output meets the design input requirements, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(f). For example: Your firm has a design input, (b)(4),  of “the Remote Monitoring device shall only open network ports to authorized interfaces” which is documented in Merlin@home EX2000 (b)(4) Software System Requirements Specification, Document (b)(4). This is implemented as a design output in your firm’s Merlin@home Software Requirements Specification Uploads (b)(4). This design output was not fully verified during your firm’s design verification activities. According to your firm’s testing procedures, (b)(4), Final Configuration Test Procedures, (b)(4) and Final Configuration Test Procedures Document (b)(4),  the requirement was only partially verified by testing that the network ports opened with an authorized interface.   Your testing procedures did not require full verification to ensure the network ports would not open with an unauthorized interface.     The adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time. Your firm provided a summary of, and implementation dates for, several corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions. However, in your firm’s response, you failed to provide evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions. 4.      Failure to ensure that design validation shall include risk analysis, where appropriate, as required by 21 CFR 820.30(g).  For example:  a.  Your firm failed to accurately incorporate the findings of a third-party assessment you commissioned, dated April 2, 2014, into your firm’s updated cybersecurity risk assessments for your high voltage and peripheral devices. Specifically: 1.      Your firm’s updated Cybersecurity Risk Assessments, (b)(4) Cybersecurity Risk Assessment, (b)(4), , Revision A, April 2, 2015 and Merlin@home Product Security Risk Assessment, (b)(4), Revision B, May 21, 2014 failed to accurately incorporate the third party report’s findings into its security risk ratings, causing your post-mitigation risk estimations to be acceptable, when, according to the report, several risks were not adequately controlled.2.      The same report identified the hardcoded universal unlock code as an exploitable hazard for your firm’s High Voltage devices.  Your firm’s Global Risk Management Procedure, SOP (b)(4),  Section 5.3.3 of Revision T, Released November 2, 2012, and Section 5.1.3 of Revision X, Released November 8, 2016, requires your firm to assess if new hazards are introduced, or previously identified hazardous situations are affected, by risk control measures. Your firm identified the hardcoded universal unlock code as a risk control measure for emergent communication. However, you failed to identify this risk control also as a hazard.  Therefore, you failed to properly estimate and evaluate the risk associated with the hardcoded universal lock code in the design of your High Voltage devices.  The adequacy of your firm’s response cannot be determined at this time. Your firm provided a summary of, and implementation dates for, several corrections, corrective actions, and systemic corrective actions. However, in your firm’s response, you failed to provide evidence of implementation for your firm’s corrections, corrective actions and systemic corrective actions. b.  Section 5.1 of your firm’s Global Risk Management Procedure, SOP (b)(4),  Revision T, outlines your firm’s risk management policy, which states that “risk management shall be integrated into all product life cycle stages, in order to assure early identification and timely mitigation of risks that could impact patient safety.” Your firm’s Returned Product Analysis Record for (b)(4)  was completed by your firm on September 12, 2011, for a device that was explanted on July 1, 2011, due to premature battery depletion. This analysis included evidence of lithium ion cluster formation. However, your firm failed to identify lithium clusters as a hazardous situation and a potential cause of premature battery depletion, through its risk management process. This process is used for batteries that are used in the Unify, Fortify, Assura, and Quadra ICDs and CRT-Ds.  We have reviewed your response and conclude that it is not adequate. In your firm’s response, you failed to provide a description and evidence of implementation for corrections and corrective actions, to include consideration of systemic corrective actions. You should take prompt action to correct the violations addressed in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in regulatory action being initiated by the FDA without further notice. These actions include, but are not limited to, seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties. Also, federal agencies may be advised of the issuance of Warning Letters about devices so that they may take this information into account when considering the award of contracts. Additionally, premarket approval applications for Class III devices to which the Quality System regulation deviations are reasonably related will not be approved until the violations have been corrected. Requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments will not be granted until the violations related to the subject devices have been corrected. Please notify this office in writing, within fifteen business days from the date you receive this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct the noted violations, as well as an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations, or similar violations, from occurring again. Include documentation of the corrective action (which must address systemic problems) you your firm has taken. If your firm’s planned corrections and/or corrective actions will occur over time, please include a timetable for implementation of those activities. If corrections and/or corrective action cannot be completed within 15 business days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which these activities will be completed. Your firm’s response should be comprehensive and address all violations included in this Warning Letter. Your response should be sent to: Food and Drug Administration, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Office of Compliance, Field Inspections Support Branch, White Oak Building 66, Rm 3540, 10903 New Hampshire Ave., Silver Spring, MD 20993.   Refer to the Unique Identification Number (519686) when replying. If you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact: Lorie Erikson at lorie.erikson@fda.hhs.gov or (301)796-7511. Finally, you should know that this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations at your firm’s facility. It is your firm’s responsibility to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations administered by FDA. The specific violations noted in this letter and in the Inspectional Observations, FDA 483, issued at the close of the inspection may be symptomatic of serious problems in your firm’s manufacturing and quality management systems. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of the violations, and take prompt actions to correct the violations and bring the products into compliance.   Sincerely yours,/S/                                                            CAPT Sean M. Boyd, MPH, USPHSDeputy Director for Regulatory AffairsOffice of ComplianceCenter for Devices and Radiological Health

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
