Wildwood, New Jersey: thanks to a combination of economics, geography, and chance, this Jersey Shore vacation spot has, for more than four decades, been home to a wealth of immaculately preserved midcentury motels. These jewels of neon and bright colors remained frozen in time until recently; now, a substantial number have been demolished and many that remain face an uncertain future.  Determined to preserve them, photographer Mark Havens has captured their unique style over 10 years, sometimes shooting motel facades while workers were demolishing the backs. With essays by Joseph Giovannini and Jamer Hunt and evocative photographs, Out of Season celebrates the architecture of a bygone era of Jersey Shore summers.




Praise

"Photographer Mark Havens spent 10 years documenting the motels of Wildwood in coastal New Jersey - a land of beautiful modernist kitsch, full of pink stilts, zig-zag verandas and ubiquitous palm trees."
— The Guardian


"Captured over ten years, Philadelphia-based artist Mark Havens gives the motels of the New Jersey city of Wildwood a different moment in the spotlight, away from the off-highway, cheap and tacky film references that popular culture associate them with. Essentially a revolutionary architectural diary, the new tome titled Out of Season: The Vanishing Architecture of the Wildwoods historically marks a dialogue that is comparable to many mid-century modern architects."
— Wallpaper


"Out of Season: The Vanishing Architecture of the Wildwoods traces the vibrant 1950s architecture that once shaped the area and is now disappearing at the hands of developers."
— Hero


"Ten years in the making, this photo collection showcases the motels of Wildwood. . . . The photos offer details large and small: not simply obvious icons such as neon signs but close shots of roof and window composition, and studious attention to the often socializing-oriented courtyard or pool-focused motel designs. The book is in some sense a catalogue of kitsch, but with much of its subject imperiled, it serves as a call for preservation as well."
— Publishers Weekly


"Photographer Mark Havens captures the beauty of each space through small details, from the specific placement of each chair to the unbroken symmetry between every window and door. The book is Havens's decade-long project, composed of dozens of images, documenting the mid-century hotels in this seaside town, some still standing, others repurposed, and many that eventually succumbed to demolition."
— Modern Magazine


"Over a 10 year period, photographer Mark Havens explored the Wildwoods motels at their quietest moments. The book sequences the photographs from dawn to night. There are no people, no sun-seekers or tourists: just evocative photographs of a unique and vanishing form of architecture."
— Atlas Obscura


"This book takes a look at the prime coastal location of Wildwood, but not for the sweet boardwalk and sandy dunes--rather, the extraordinary well-preserved midcentury motels that dot the town. . . . photographer Mark Havens managed to capture the underlying kitschy spirit of each one."
— Interview


"Havens' book is a quiet but striking reminder of Wildwood's glory days as not only the epicenter of summer vacations in the mid-Atlantic, but of the bold moves of developers and architects alike during the 50s and 60s."
— Curbed.com


"At a time when luxury towers and cookie-cutter condo and retail sites now dominate America's landscapes, older buildings often fall victim to gentrification. Thankfully, Philadelphia-based photographer Mark Havens has embarked on a 10-year exploration to preserve the memory of some of the nation's most colorfully eclectic and iconic architecture: the vanishing motels of the Jersey Shore's Wildwood."
— The Daily Beast


"The photographer Mark Havens spent a decade photographing mid-century architecture along the New Jersey coast. . . More than 100 of those images have been compiled into a book. . . .[Havens] photographed the buildings at the beginning or end of the season, when artificial palm trees still bent over the decks, and the pools were still full of water."
— CityLab


"Mark Havens spent his childhood exploring the Jersey Shore's kitschy jewel: Wildwood. Once home to the country's largest concentration of midcentury hotel architecture, the barrier island's distinctive plastic-palm facade has given way to modern condominium development. . . He started photographing the tourist destination nearly 10 years ago, capturing the kidney-shaped pools, the looping neon signs, and the barrage of faded colors before they were gone."
— The Atlantic


"Can't get to the beach before the end of summer? Flip through the pages of Philadelphia artist Havens' cool photo book. It captures the vintage modernist architecture of Wildwood on the Jersey Shore. . . . Slather on the sunscreen, pour yourself a cold one and enjoy." 
— New York Post


"Some love the Jersey Shore for the sea and sand, others for the boardwalks. Photographer Mark Havens' favorite think about the shore is a bit less predictable: the architecture. In his new coffee-table book, Out of Season, Havens--a regular on the beaches of Wildwood, New Jersey--presents a collection of more than 100 photos of the stunning midcentury-modern motels of Wildwood." 
— DuJour


"Mark Havens' love for the Wildwoods' motels has been a consuming passion for the last 10 years. . . . Havens hope the new book that reflects his admiration for Wildwood motel architecture will increase peopl's appreciation for the examples that remain. . . Out of Season: The Vanishing Architecture of the Wildwoods features 105 photos spread over 224 pages." 
— The Press of Atlantic City

PORTRAIT: Mark Abrams, Port 68 
Susan Dickenson, January 5, 2011
 
Mark Abrams in Port 68's IHFC Interhall showroom during the October 2010 High Point Market.FOR MARK ABRAMS, TWO EVENTS stand out as career highlights, and both of them happened in 2009. One is the ARTS Award for product design he won that January in Dallas. The other is Port 68, the home decor company he and business partner Michael Yip premiered a few months later at the High Point market.     Based in Chicago, Port 68's collections of lamps, accent furniture, upholstered chairs, benches and decorative accessories are all designed by Abrams and reflect his personal penchant for good antiques, unique treasures and current fashion. His use of colors, textures and patterns freshen lamps, shades, oriental porcelain and a variety of decorative accessories, in a way that adds an element of the unexpected. All the while, the designs adhere to Port 68's mission to "bring fresh, classic, designer-driven products to the marketplace with a clear point of view and defined merchandising story."     Abrams' design story begins in his junior year at the University of Alabama, when he interned for Raymond Waites, also a native Alabamian, at Waites' company Gear, in New York. Waites offered Abrams a job upon his graduation the following June. Abrams and his current business partner first met in the early '90s at Alex & Ivy, a retail division of the Bombay Company where Abrams worked as creative director and buyer.     What ultimately led to your and Michael's decision to start Port 68? We were both transitioning away from a past business relationship - where he worked for the company, and I was licensing under my brand name Mark Abrams Design. Upon ending my license, and him leaving the company, we felt this was a good opportunity to continue our business relationship with the formation of our own company.







     What are your "official" titles? Michael is the president, and I'm the vice president of design and marketing.     What's the biggest challenge you face on a daily basis? Building our young business in this challenging economy.      How have you seen the industry change over the years? There is so much wonderful product out there. You have to find your niche and focus on being the best that you can be, in the style and category that you want to be known for. Buyers and consumers are much more educated in what they see and know about products. It's important to offer good customer service and great fresh product, and to treat your customers like business partners. When all that happens, we all win!     Who or what have been major influences/inspirations in your work? I would have to say wonderful antiques inspire me. Great interiors where you walk into a room and say "Wow!" Growing up in the South, I was fortunate to be exposed to Southern hospitality and wonderful old homes where the little old ladies still live like "Driving Miss Daisy." I remember my Aunt Bessie having carved mahogany chairs, floral carpets and live geraniums year-round in her sunroom. Great style can be as simple as a mass of red geraniums in the window.     Where do you live now? Off Lake Michigan in Chicago     Do you use Port 68 products to decorate your own home? Of course. Plus, some of the products that are in our collection are based on antiques that I have. I love to mix the old with the new.     What are some of your favorites? My Mandarin Spice lamp is a wonderful painted porcelain with a dragon pattern in the orange/ spice color. I also add a little zebra with our Kenya Collection.     What's in store for the future? We keep growing in products every season. Our plan is to keep bringing fashionable products that we love to the marketplace.

The 120mm gun fires the following ammunition - M865 TPCSDS-T and M831 TP-T training rounds, the M8300 HEAT-MP-T and the M829 APFSDS-T which includes a depleted uranium penetrator. Textron Systems provides the Cadillac Gage gun turret drive stabilisation system.The commander has a 12.7mm Browning M2 machine gun and the loader has a 7.62mm M240 machine gun. A 7.62mm M240 machine gun is also mounted coaxially on the right hand side of the main armament.Depleted uranium armourThe M1A1 tank incorporates steel-encased depleted uranium armour. Armour bulkheads separate the crew compartment from the fuel tanks.The top panels of the tank are designed to blow outwards in the event of penetration by a HEAT projectile. The tank is protected against nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) warfare.One L8A1 six-barrelled smoke grenade discharger is fitted on each side of the turret. A smoke screen can also be laid by an engine-operated system.In August 2006,GDLS was awarded a contract to produce 505 tank urban survivability kits (TUSK) for the US Army Abrams tanks.TUSK includes add-on reactive armour tiles, loader's armour gun shield (LAGS), tank infantry phone (TIP), Raytheon loader's thermal weapon sight with Rockwell Collins head-mounted display and BAE Systems thermal driver's rear-view camera (DRVC). TUSK entered service on M1A1 / M1A2 tanks in late 2007 and was deployed to Iraq.Australian M1A1 tanks are fitted with Saab Barracuda multispectral camouflage systems which reduce the tank's visual, radar and infra-red signature.Fire control and observationThe commander's station is equipped with six periscopes, providing a 360° view. The Raytheon commander's independent thermal viewer (CITV) provides the commander with independent stabilised day and night vision with a 360° view, automatic sector scanning, automatic target cueing of the gunner's sight and back-up fire control.The M1A2 Abrams tank has a two-axis Raytheon gunner's primary sight - line of sight (GPS-LOS) which increases the first round hit probability by providing faster target acquisition and improved gun pointing."The first M1 Abrams battle tanks were delivered to the US Army in 1980. In all 3,273 M1 tanks were produced for the US Army."The thermal imaging system (TIS) has magnification ×10 narrow field of view and ×3 wide field of view. The thermal image is displayed in the eyepiece of the gunner's sight together with the range measurement from a laser range finder.The Northrop Grumman (formerly Litton) Laser Systems eyesafe laser range finder (ELRF) has a range accuracy to within 10m and target discrimination of 20m. The gunner also has a Kollmorgen Model 939 auxiliary sight with magnification ×8 and field of view 8°.The digital fire control computer is supplied by General Dynamics - Canada (formerly Computing Devices Canada).The fire control computer automatically calculates the fire control solution based on - lead angle measurement, bend of the gun measured by the muzzle reference system, velocity measurement from a wind sensor on the roof of the turret and data from a pendulum static cant sensor located at the centre of the turret roof.The operator manually inputs data on ammunition type, temperature and barometric pressure.The driver has either three observation periscopes or two periscopes on either side and a central image intensifying periscope for night vision. The periscopes provide 120° field of view.The DRS Technologies driver's vision enhancer (DVE), AN/VSS-5, is based on a 328×245 element uncooled infra-red detector array, operating in the 7.5 to 13 micron waveband. A Raytheon driver's thermal viewer, AN/VAS-3, is installed on the M1A2 Abrams tanks for Kuwait.PropulsionThe M1 is equipped with a Honeywell AGT 1500 gas turbine engine. The Allison X-1100-3B transmission provides four forward and two reverse gears.The US Army has selected Honeywell International Engines and Systems and General Electric to develop a new LV100-5 gas turbine engine for the M1A2. The new engine is lighter and smaller with rapid acceleration, quieter running and no visible exhaust.The Global Armoured and Counter-IED Vehicles Market 2011-2021This project forms part of our recent analysis and forecasts of the global armoured and counter-IED vehicles market available from our business information platform Strategic Defence Intelligence.
