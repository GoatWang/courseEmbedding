 Business Highlight: 
Farmobile was founded in the fall of 2013 as a self-funded company with two visions in mind, which were to digitize global agriculture and to protect farmer data rights in the process.  Based in Kansas City, Farmobile develops real-time proprietary data collection tools that standardize geo-located agronomic and machine data, regardless of the manufacturer. The company is a champion for farmer data rights, ownership and data portability.

FARMOBILE IS
#FARMERPOWER

Farmobile is the farm data company.Farmers own their data outright.


We believe data is one of the most valuable things a farmer harvests, and yet too many of our neighbors around the country give their information away for a pittance. No one should ever know more about your farm than you.
From Big Ag to Silicon Valley and back again, the race to gather farm data is on. Some genetics companies, equipment manufacturers and freemium startups want an informational edge to target your margin. It's time to protect your data like the significant asset it really is. Own your data. Own your relationships. Own your margins. We exist to believe in #FarmerPower.
Farmobile empowers farmers with data driven technologies that farmers trust, prefer and love. We help farmers easily interact with their data, negotiate from a position of strength, and steward their land for generations to come.
We're from the farm ourselves, based in Kansas and built from the ground up with hard work and nothing else to our name, except a love of agriculture, the ability to write code and a deep desire to make a real difference.
We built our system based on what you told us matters most. You're in it for the long haul, and we are too. We are staunchly pro-farmer, pro-data rights, and pro-innovation. We're staffed and backed by incredibly talented people that think the same way you do.
Our product is affordable to a fault. It's the best design and code on the market. And we even have our own data-gathering hardware that ensures that the decisions you make based on our system are impeccably accurate.
We'd love to show you what we can do. Contact us today.

Founders & Execs






Jason Tatge
Co-Founder & CEO 
Jason Tatge serves as CEO.  Jason has been a driving entrepreneurial force behind leading internet & Ag-Tech companies for over 15 years. His previous company, Farms Technology, created an electronic marketplace to automate grain transaction and risk management processes, offering automated hedging algorithms accessible via smartphones and tablets. Farms Technology was purchased by DuPont/Pioneer in December 2012.
Following the successful exit of Farms Technology, Jason became intensely focused on using IoT devices to passively collect data from farm equipment as farmers operate on their land. Half of U.S. farmers leave this valuable data locked in their machines. Farmobile was created to provide Farmers with real time access and ownership to their farming information.
Jason earned a degree in Financial Economics from Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter MN and an MBA from The Fogelmen School at The University of Memphis.  Jason served as the Pipeline Member President, and is actively involved with the Entrepreneurial community. Jason and his wife live in Bucyrus, KS and have two children.




Heath Gerlock
Co-Founder and Director of Product
Heath Gerlock grew up row-crop farming and raising a variety of livestock in Southwest Iowa. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, his brother, sister and their families continue to farm. The challenges of farming during the 80’s and 90’s cultivated creativity, resourcefulness, a strong work ethic, and a passion to solve agriculture challenges.
Heath pursued a career in technology in 2000. In the decade following he successfully deployed hardware, internet, and mobile technology solutions for healthcare, agriculture, weather, finance, and ministry non-profits. Heath has honed skills in a variety of design disciplines ranging from traditional print, interactive displays, and mobile and web user interfaces. 
He is passionate about Agriculture, simplifying user experiences, and creating technology entirely in service of the customer.


Randy Nuss
Co-Founder and Director Engineering
Randy grew up and attended school in the Cornhusker state. His engineering pursuits have lead him to positions in the PC, cellphone, automotive, and healthcare industries. Randy has used his expertise in embedded systems and communication system design to develop products for HP, Intel, Stanley, Samsung, and Motorola.
Working in the Ag industry has allowed Randy to get his boots dirty -literally. Driving over 70,000 miles to farms, and getting on hundreds of machines, Randy has learned a few things. His goal is to normalize data from a lot of disparate systems, so it can be collected and managed in a single place. The precision Ag landscape can be confusing, but Farmobile is working hard to clear up the picture when it comes to data.
Randy knows there is always another machine or system out there to be learned, and he’ll be on the road to figure it out.




Chris Schibi
Chief Technology Officer
Chris has 33+ years of experience and has worked extensively across all the major computing platforms ranging from mainframe to mobile technologies. Throughout his career, he has been an early stage contributor specializing in startup ventures.
Prior to his most recent startup venture, Chris was the CTO of a well-established technology consulting firm in Kansas City helping both local and regional clients achieve demonstrable returns on large scale technology investments.
With a diverse background in executive leadership and as an entrepreneur, Chris understands the value of capital investment and how critical decision-making drives innovation while balancing the financial objectives of the business.


Jessi Kingsbury
Chief Operating Officer
Jessi has an extensive background in Finance, HR, and startup-to-success tech companies. Prior to joining the Farmer Power team at Farmobile, she was a founding employee and CFO of BATS Global Markets, a Kansas City based global stock exchange. She led many key projects and back office functions from BATS’ inception in 2005 and through its national and global high-growth stages. Previously she held the positions of Controller and Equity Trader at Tradebot Systems, a proprietary trading firm.
Jessi graduated from the Bloch School of Business at the University of Missouri – Kansas City with degrees in Finance and Economics. Jessi and her fireman husband live in Kansas City, MO and are the proud parents of three incredible kids. Jessi is driven to empower personal and company growth as Farmobile puts the true value of real-time data in farmer’s hands!




Justin Stouder
VP Software Development
Justin had the great privilege of growing up in a small town in rural Indiana.  In 2002, after graduating from Purdue University with a bachelor’s degree in Organizational Leadership and Supervision, he moved to Kansas City and started his career in Software Development.
With successful stints at Perceptive Software, EMC RSA, and LockPath, Justin brought his optimistic, can-do approach to Farmobile in December of 2015.  He considers it an incredible opportunity to combine his rural roots and passion for technology together in an exceptionally meaningful way on behalf of Farmers across the globe!
Justin’s favorite things to do involve spending time with his family, exercising, backpacking, and climbing Colorado’s fourteen-thousand foot mountains.  He lives in Overland Park, KS with his wife and two kids.


Matt Kamphoefner
VP Sales and Business Development
Born and raised on a corn, soybean and beef cattle operation in rural Missouri, Matt holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Avila University, graduating summa cum laude. Matt began his career with the USDA’s Risk Management Agency (RMA) holding various roles on the actuarial team, new product development, and later managing a team of economists. Combining rural roots with mathematics, Matt was able to represent the ‘voice of farmer’ as an early Product Team member, and also led Climate’s Overland Park, KS insurance office.
Having made farm visits in some 30 states, Matt is always eager to learn about the uniqueness of a new region. While his brother continues to run the fifth generation farm located outside St. Louis, Matt resides in Leawood, KS with his wife and three children.

Your data. Real-time. Anytime.
Watch current acitivity as it happens.
PUC is a small device that rides in your cab to gather your machine and agronomic data. View your digital information in the Farmobile app or the Dashboard – current or historical – from anywhere at any time.
Boost operational efficiency and glean new insights by sharing data layers and reports with your agronomist, insurance agent or co-op.
Coming Soon: Accept offers to sell your Electronic Field Records (EFRs) to approved third party buyers via the Data Store. You own the data so it’s always your choice to sell it.





Farmobile Benefits



                    Collect
                

                    The Farmobile PUC is a small connected device that you can install on farm machinery in minutes. Once installed, PUC will automatically collect data from connected cabs every second. PUC collects more data elements (agronomic and machine data) than any other technology and automatically formats to an EFR. Farmobile securely stores these data layers making it easy to view your digital fields in the Dashboard.
                





                    Share
                

Access or download EFRs anytime through the Farmobile Dashboard or from your mobile device. This makes it easy to share your EFR layers with trusted partners, such as insurance agents or agronomists to get them the information they need, when they need it.
                





                    Sell
                

                    Data becomes the infinite commodity as you sell single-use licensed copies to multiple buyers. By certifying EFRs in the Dashboard, these EFRs become eligible for sale, giving you a new profit opportunity. Farmobile is creating a marketplace where farmers can choose to sell their digital assets to vetted third-parties for the first time.  
                



Don't forget your Apps




Farmobile App


                    The lifeblood of the digital-ag economy is quality farm data straight from the field. Take your digital information with you at all times with your connected device. The Farmobile app is a full feature app that contains all elements of the Dashboard. 
                






Farmobile Notes App


                    The PUC is a magical data collection tool — geo-tagged and time-stamped — each second of engine and agronomic information is recorded and displayed. Sometimes, though, you might want to enhance that data with additional content. In seconds, you can add photos, text notes, or audio records that are geo-tagged and time-stamped. Importantly, view and share these notes in the context of your EFRs so that you can have all data in one place.
                





How it works.
Farmobile unifies disparate farm data so you can store, share and profit.



Collect from Mixed Fleets
PUC is a small device that installs on most brands of machinery in minutes.
PUC listens and wirelessly sends second-by-second data points to your secure Farmobile account.
Download list of machine & sensor info



Manage & Share Your EFRs
Farmobile builds standardized field-by-field data cards called EFRs (Electronic Field Records), the data standard for digital agricultural. Share your EFRs with those you trust. Your data is easy to view and share via the Farmobile app or Dashboard and automated daily reports.



ROI via Data Store
Implement a digital strategy with a clear ROI. The Data Store Guarantee of $2/acre revenue return is widely available in 2017. Then choose to deploy your independent dataset for services you subscribe. Digital assets accrue value over time, don’t leave 2017 in the cab.





Pricing
Collect your data. You can do this.
