    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

About the Sam Yagan Interview




I studied Applied Mathematics in college, and after working on SparkNotes and eDonkey, I co-founded OkCupid with 3 far more talented people: Chris Coyne, Max Krohn, and Christian Rudder. After we sold OkCupid to Match, I became the CEO of The Match Group, which includes not just Match and OkCupid, but also Tinder, Meetic, OurTime, and about 40 other brands around the world.
Incredulously, I have been named to TIME Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People in the World,” and Fortune Magazine’s “40 Under 40.”
The three most common new year's resolutions involve money/career, health/fitness, and relationships, making this our busiest time of the year as millions of people make finding love a renewed priority. I've got 12 years of experience running dating businesses and all the data at my fingertips, ready to help you if I can. AMA.
https://twitter.com/reddit_AMA/status/552114778504982528
Thanks so much for your questions! Please check out OkCupid, Match, Tinder, or any of our other products! I hope you enjoyed this AMA as much as I did. Best, Sam.
Sam Yagan Jan 05, 2015













I very clearly pointed out in my profile that I will totally NOT murder any of my potential matches but for some reason, I can't find true love.
Any ideas on how I can improve my odds?


Warlizard








Maybe have a more inviting username than "warlizard"? :)


Sam Yagan








Could you please implement a function on OkCupid that allows for people to search and see if they're in their matches' preferred age range? This is a common addition that gets asked for a lot on /r/okcupid


CatsPajammies








I'm not sure we'll do it exactly that way, but we have often discussed ways of enforcing people's age preferences. The problem is that not everyone cares about their age ranges equally, meaning that many people don't at all mind chatting with people outside their ranges -- their ranges are a preference, but not a firm filter.


Sam Yagan








Is online dating "good" for society? Why or why not, and what are the potential unintended consequences of this behavior?
Btw, I met girlfriend of over a year on OkCupid, so thanks! :)


bhalp1








I love this question. I've long believed that dating apps truly make society better, in several ways:
1) Undoubtedly, greater choice leads to the selection of higher quality spouses.
2) Technology makes it easier to meet people who are less similar (farther away, different socioeconomic levels, different ethnicity, etc.).
3) The ease of getting back in the dating market makes empowers people in bad relationships to leave them, knowing that loneliness isn't the only alternative to their current situation.


Sam Yagan








Being the CEO of a group that discernably specialises in finding love, have you personally used any of your services and subsequently found success? 


jairachi








Here's some OkCupid trivia: None of the four founders has ever been on an online date of any kind.


Sam Yagan








How has the role of data and algorithms changed in the life of OKCupid? I feel like initially, it was more data-driven and gave users more access to match percentages. Lately, the interface has felt more Tinder-like, focusing on spending less time per match and showcasing photos and quick blurbs of text if any. Do you think this trend of focusing on quick, picture-based interactions will continue? Thank you!


Joseph_KP








I wouldn't say it's about picture-based or not picture-based. Pictures are always important in any dating environment. More important, though, is the form factor. The average person checks her smartphone over 100 times a day and the average time a person spends in an app is about 90 second. Consumers now expect to get value from an app in under a minute, while we at OkCupid are as data-geeky as ever, the interface for users will continue to evolve to feel as current and relevant as possible.


Sam Yagan








But treadmills might lead to better dates.


read_dance_love








I think you've just come up with the next big thing!


Sam Yagan








Does the free-ness of OKC attract a different group of people as compared to Match's subscription fee? Do you think this would even go as far to affect the relationship that could be formed from each site? Which site see's the most traffic? How does that relate to matches? Last one, how it feel know you're sites have paired literally tens of thousands of people together?


link287








Each dating product attracts a different user, and "freeness" is just one component (Tinder & OkC attract different users; Match and OurTime attract different users, etc.). So, yes, Match users and OkC users are different. I hate talking about "better quality" when referring to human beings, but it is true that people who pay for Match likely have higher intent than people on OkCupid or Tinder.


Sam Yagan








Yea, I've heard that before. I've always wondered though, "why not?". Is there any specific reason you guys chose to not try out online dating yourselves? 


OkAlt








We were all dating our future wives when we started OkC. And before that, we were basically in college where online dating wasn't really pervasive.


Sam Yagan








You've owned and sold many successful companies. What are some of your best productivity tips?
Bonus question: What's your favorite color?


tonywork88








I'll take the extra credit first: Orange. :)
As for productivity:
1 - I view every minute as previous and try not to waste time doing anything that isn't very productive or very enjoyable.
2 - Email can be a huge waste of time or incredibly efficient. For me, it's the latter; I write about 25,000 emails a year and it's easily my primary mode of communication.
3 - I set priorities and try to stick to them. If I am working on something really important or really urgent, I ask myself why I am doing it.


Sam Yagan








Hey there! I actually just wanted to let you know that I found the love of my life on OkCupid. We've been together for 2 years.
How is the overall satisfaction rate for your other endeavors? 


NerfHerdess








That's awesome! You made my day! We get countless success stories from users across all of our products, so I think satisfaction rates are pretty high. At the end of the day, you get out of dating products what you put into them, so people who really engage earnestly usually find success.


Sam Yagan








Hi Sam! I was wondering what historical data tells us about all these new users (for both genders) that pop up at the beginning of the year, presumably because they made finding love part of their 2015 resolution? Sometimes I wonder how many of them will actually end up sticking around the OKCupid community, or will most of these 'rush' profiles end up being abandoned/deactivated in a few days, much like gym goers in January disappears after the first week, and not really worth messaging?
By the way, thank you for founding OKCupid! You've helped me find happy, meaningful relationships that helped me grow over the years :)


ottawapharmer








Great question. While certainly a few of the people who signup for dating apps in the new year's rush don't stick around, the vast majority do. Not sure how that compares with gym memberships, but my guess is that dating apps do better since they don't require you to actually get out of your house, show up at a gym, and then exercise. You can just fire up the app wherever you are and then have fun on dates. Dates are better than treadmills! :)


Sam Yagan








How active is OKC's user base outside of the US and EU?
Thanks for doing this AMA!


HerbalWine








OkC does really well in English-speaking countries and really poorly outside. It's on our list. :)


Sam Yagan








Why do high matches on okcupid ignore each other? Am I not grabbing peoples attention? Why is it harder for same sex daters to find dates on okcupid?


jbwncster








On your second question, I believe that OkCupid is the dating app of choice for most same-sex daters. We have always welcomed same-sex daters and individuals from other marginalized communities.
Why do high matches ignore each other? Well, most people ignore other people -- online and offline -- but Christian has done the research and we know for a fact that high match percentages definitely increase the probability that two people will communicate.
If you send me a link to your profile, I can try to see if I have any suggestions to make it more grabby. :)


Sam Yagan








What has been the biggest challenge of your career?


Iggtastic








Gosh, so many. I think the biggest challenge was turning OkCupid around. In 2009, OkC really wasn't doing well. Growth had slowed. We were running out of money. We'd been doing it for six years and the founders were all getting impatient. But we all dug in and saved the company, turning it in to what it is today.


Sam Yagan








Hi Sam, thanks for this AMA!
I was really wondering how a day in the life of Sam Yagan looks like.
Bonus question - What are some of your hobbies, and how do you get by a weekend?


dyorel








I spend a lot of time traveling (we have offices in Dallas, NYC, LA, Paris, Rio, SF, etc.), but when i wake up at home, I typically get up early (today was 5:15) go for a run (today was 5k) and get my kids ready for school and off to the bus stop. I try to be at work by 8 and spend most of my day talking to the people who run the various businesses (Tinder, Match, OkCupid, Meetic, etc) or our big functions (Technology, product, finance, marketing, analytics, etc.). Then home for dinner with the family, before catching up on email after the kids turn in.
Hobbies? I used to have them. Now I just have little kids. :)


Sam Yagan








What do you think is the biggest hurdle in making internet dating "cool"?


JustWing








It gets more and more mainstream every day. I dont even really care about "cool" i just want it to be "normal." I want everyone who wants love/friendship/dates/relationships to have them. I want to contribute to that mission every single day. And I dont want anyone to be deprived of affection or companionship because the most effective tool ever created -- online dating -- is somehow not "cool" or "normal" enough. It just makes me sad. 


Sam Yagan








What's your favorite kind of soup?


I_smell_awesome








Used to be cream of mushroom. Now probably something with butternut squash or corn. Or both.


Sam Yagan








How do you feel about people using your sites for side action? It's unfortunate, but I know it does happen.


BardLemon








Whenever I think about online dating, i always start with the offline dating analog. I don't condone "side action," whether found online or offline, but it's not the bar or the dating app at fault, of course, it's the "side actor."

Family and education[edit]
The son of Syrian immigrants, Al and Dr. Haifa Yagan,[3][4] Sam was instilled with an entrepreneurial spirit at a young age. He grew up in Bourbonnais, Illinois, and studied at the Illinois Math and Science Academy and eventually Harvard University. Yagan holds a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Economics from Harvard University and an MBA from Stanford University, where he earned distinction as a Siebel Scholar, an Arjay Miller Scholar, and the Henry Ford Scholar, the award granted to each class’s valedictorian.[5] His brother Danny Yagan is an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.[6] His wife Jessica Droste Yagan is the CEO of Impact Engine, an impact investing fund.[citation needed]

eDonkey, Inc.[edit]
By age 25 Yagan was the president of eDonkey (founded in 2002), a P2P file-sharing network. As the developer of eDonkey, Yagan testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee expressing a need for balance between innovation and intellectual property.[9]

I dont even really care about "cool" i just want it to be "normal."  I want everyone who wants love/friendship/dates/relationships to have them.  I want to contribute to that mission every single day.  And I dont want anyone to be deprived of affection or companionship because the most effective tool ever created -- online dating -- is somehow not "cool" or "normal" enough.  It just makes me sad.

In offline dating, race is one of the first things that someone notices about you.  Because you can't reveal your race over time as easily offline as you can online, the rejection often comes earlier.  Believe me, we care deeply about this topic and Christian wrote some pretty ground-breaking stuff on this topic on the blog: http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/your-race-affects-whether-people-write-you-back/.

Just a matter of priorities.

We've found that up to 60% men or so still leads to a high quality experience; once it gets much more than that, there can be ecosystem challenges.  Of course, that threshold varies by product.  On a linear product like Tinder, larger imbalances can be supported.

What are the cons to email?  I mean, sure, there's a time and a place for everything, but no one ever asks "Do you shop online" or "do you communicate online" yet people still ask "do you date online."  
Biggest pro is that you get dates. :)

I don't condone "side action," whether found online or offline, but it's not the bar or the dating app at fault, of course, it's the "side actor."

We get countless success stories from users across all of our products, so I think satisfaction rates are pretty high.  At the end of the day, you get out of dating products what you put into them, so people who really engage earnestly usually find success.

So, yes, Match users and OkC users are different.  I hate talking about "better quality" when referring to human beings, but it is true that people who pay for Match likely have higher intent than people on OkCupid or Tinder.

My guess is that was several years ago (2010 or 2011?), when we once had an issue with our admin tools.  As for our own employees, we log all of the user account access that happens, and review it for impropriety.

While certainly a few of the people who signup for dating apps in the new year's rush don't stick around, the vast majority do.  Not sure how that compares with gym memberships, but my guess is that dating apps do better since they don't require you to actually get out of your house, show up at a gym, and then exercise. You can just fire up the app wherever you are and then have fun on dates.  Dates are better than treadmills! :)

In 2009, OkC really wasn't doing well.  Growth had slowed.  We were running out of money.  We'd been doing it for six years and the founders were all getting impatient.  But we all dug in and saved the company, turning it in to what it is today.

I try to be at work by 8 and spend most of my day talking to the people who run the various businesses (Tinder, Match, OkCupid, Meetic, etc) or our big functions (Technology, product, finance, marketing, analytics, etc.).  Then home for dinner with the family, before catching up on email after the kids turn in.
Hobbies? I used to have them.  Now I just have little kids. :)

Let's see how apps + mobile data + social presence evolve over the next couple years before we look beyond that.

The problem is that not everyone cares about their age ranges equally, meaning that many people don't at all mind chatting with people outside their ranges -- their ranges are a preference, but not a firm filter.

Second look at http://www.amazon.com/Dataclysm-When-Think-Ones-Looking/dp/0385347375.
Finally, yes, I think technical backgrounds are probably the most helpful for people in business.

AMA. by Sam_Yagan in IAmA[–]Sam_Yagan[S] 320 points321 points322 points 2 years ago (0 children)I love this question.  I've long believed that dating apps truly make society better, in several ways:
1) Undoubtedly, greater choice leads to the selection of higher quality spouses.
2) Technology makes it easier to meet people who are less similar (farther away, different socioeconomic levels, different ethnicity, etc.).
3) The ease of getting back in the dating market makes empowers people in bad relationships to leave them, knowing that loneliness isn't the only alternative to their current situation.

Confessions of a Former Entrepreneur


Sam Yagan sold OkCupid to Match.com for a ton of money. Why is he feeling so antsy?


As told to Burt Helm







8 COMMENTS

Courtesy Subject
Sam Yagan, founder of OkCupid











Sam Yagan started his first company, SparkNotes, as a Harvard senior in 1999 and sold it the next year for $30 million. In January, he sold his third company, dating website OkCupid, to IAC for $50 million.
We got our first serious offer in September 2010. I never asked for it. Someone said, "Are you interested in selling?" I said, "We're not for sale, but I'd take a look." It was in the ballpark, so I called three other potential bidders. Four months later, we agreed to sell to Match.com [a subsidiary of IAC] for $50 million in cash. We felt like it was a chance to give our investors, our employees, and us a great return, and do right by our customers, since Match agreed not to change anything.
For the other 17 people here at OkCupid, nothing has changed. That's part of my job. I have a lot more meetings. I go to Dallas [where Match is based] once a month for two days. I also get to take things off my plate, like finance, HR, and legal, that were less interesting to me. I like being part of a big company's executive team. It's fun to stretch other parts of my brain, considering questions like, How should we think of acquisitions? I get to be privy to things that would never come up at a small company.
Plus, I think this year, my wife and I will actually get to go on vacation.
But on the other hand—all I know how to do is start companies. What do I say when people ask me what I do? "I work for a big company"? I mean, a lot of people do. It's great. But it's almost like having a sex-change operation. Part of me is like, What's my identity, if it's not the company I'm building?
There is a soul search that is happening parallel to my day-to-day life.
My OkCupid co-founders are my best friends. We were in each other's weddings. The other night, we went out to dinner. We spent half our time bullshitting around, and then we started discussing our future. Whether it's now or in a year or five years, do we want to start another company together? What are people's goals in life? I can imagine a life where a big paycheck and the cool perks and being part of the executive team of a big company would be great. I'd love to summer in the Hamptons. But I'm still in a building phase. I'm 34 years old. In most jobs, your early 30s to early 40s are your power years. So if this is my power decade, should I be saying, This is the time for my big entrepreneurial move? Should I try to build a billion-dollar company? Should we put all our money together and say, What is the next LinkedIn or Groupon or Facebook?
If I start again, I can now fundraise better, but I still start at Square One. It's still going to be four guys in a small office with Ikea desks. Part of me is like, Is that still appealing? And it is.
Life is just a set of experiences. As long as there are new experiences for me in a corporate job, I don't think I have to be an entrepreneur. The cool thing about being an entrepreneur is I can guarantee to myself that it's going to be new, because I'm going to make it so.

Knows your potential.  Pushes you until you get there.  Throws in massive amounts of knowledge along the way.  Ignore his advice at your own peril.  We're lucky to have his honest feedback.  Dry sense... more of humor so we got along well.  No better feeling than when he tells you he's confident you'll succeed.

And before that, we were basically in college where online dating wasn't really pervasive.”Dissatisfied with this answer, one Redditor quipped: “Sounds like a ringing endorsement!”Nonetheless, Yagan reiterated his belief that online dating was “the most effective tool ever created” for finding “affection or companionship.” He also offered guidance to one frustrated Redditor, going by the name “Warlizard,” who wondered why he had yet to find “true love” on an online dating site.Yagan ventured: “Maybe have a more inviting username than 'warlizard'? :).”The king of the “swipe right” universe declined to confirm if a paid version of Tinder was in the works, nor was he able to satisfy everyone with a question to ask in the limited time available.As one put it: “So, just like on OkCupid, you respond a couple times and disappear?”Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

Yagan hires Orbitz, Groupon, Braintree vets to join battle with Amazon


Sam Yagan didn't waste any time assembling a high-octane team that reads like a greatest hits of Chicago tech.Since he was named CEO in July of Amazon competitor ShopRunner, Yagan has hired former Orbitz Chief Technology Officer Roger Liew; Shafiq Shariff, former head of product and engineering at Groupon Goods; Ozan Kaya as chief financial officer from Kapow; Lindsay Verstegen, head of talent, from Braintree; Greg Ball, former vice president of technology at Orbitz; and Margaret Jastrebski, who was vice president of product management at Signal. He also hired Stacey Bernhard, a former sales exec at Match.com, as chief operating officer.ShopRunner provides shipping and other e-commerce services to consumers for 150 retailers such as Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Eddie Bauer. Yagan bet that stars who had worked for big companies might be looking to get back to something more like a startup.







​ "I like the notion of helping the underdogs compete," says Liew, who left Orbitz after it was bought by Expedia in late 2015. "I can get to know all the engineers." At Orbitz he led a team of 850 people. ShopRunner has an engineering team of about 25. Liew and Verstegen also see an opportunity to do better on diversity. "We've done a terrible job," Liew says of tech companies. But to avoid the trap that has led most tech companies to have too few women and minorities, Yagan and his team will have to shift gears and not just look to former friends and colleagues they've worked with in the past when filling new jobs. "It's our first hurdle," Verstegen says.Yagan and the team are holed up temporarily at 1871, but they're looking for new digs. With the management team in place, Yagan says he'll likely make another 30 or so hires this year, most of them in Chicago. ShopRunner, which has large offices near Philadelphia and in San Mateo, Calif., has about 70 employees. Yagan took the job only because ShopRunner was willing to let him stay in Chicago and build a team here."I was able to hand-pick a great team," he says. "It provides a blueprint, showing there are ways to bring companies here."Now comes the hard part—taking on Amazon, which is believed to have more than 60 million subscribers to its Prime membership service, which offers free shipping. ShopRunner, backed by Alibaba, has about 4 million members, up from 3 million a year ago. Yagan wants to double the users this year.Game on.
