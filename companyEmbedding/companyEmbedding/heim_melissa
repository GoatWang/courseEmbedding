Melissa "Mel" Heim to Serve as Executive VP Operations of Eastside Distilling
        																																																								
              
















 News provided by
Eastside Distilling, Inc.

PORTLAND, Ore., Dec. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Eastside Distilling, Inc. (OTCQB: ESDI) ("Eastside" or the "Company") today announced the appointment of its Master Distiller, Melissa "Mel" Heim, to the additional role of Executive Vice President of Operations. As Executive Vice President, Ms. Heim is now the senior-most operational manager at the company's Portland headquarters and production facility.










 







							 		Eastside Distilling, Inc. appoints its Master Distiller, Melissa "Mel" Heim, to the additional role of Executive Vice President of Operations.
							  



 

 
 



Ms. Heim, who earns industry accolades for her keen palate, holds the distinction of being the first female master distiller west of the Mississippi. Before joining Eastside, Ms. Heim perfected her spirit crafting skills under the tutelage of the master distiller of Portland's Rogue Distillery & Public House. Appropriately for her new job position, Ms. Helm co-founded and served as president of Clear Boots Society, an organization that supports women's leadership in the spirits industry.
A Portland native, Ms. Heim is an active soccer player in the PDX adult recreation league and, as a pre-teen, set Oregon records by achieving her first of three black belts in the Korean martial art of Tae-Kwon-Do with over twenty years of mixed martial arts experience. She graduated from Canby High School in 2001 and went on to study English at the University of Oregon where she was a member of the school's Tae-Kwon-Do Club.  
Grover Wickersham, Executive Chairman of Eastside Distilling, commented, "As our new Exec VP, Mel will continue to put the highest possible quality into our spirits as we increase production to meet growing demand both here in Oregon and in exotic new markets like China, Canada and Seattle."
Wickersham continued, "Mel has truly 'paid her dues' and earned her new senior leadership role. Despite being a youthful and energetic 33 years old Master Distiller, Mel is already a modestly grizzled ten-year veteran of the craft spirits movement. Mel has created by herself, or helped to create, a portfolio of whiskeys including Burnside Bourbon, Barrel Hitch, Cherry Bomb, Marionberry, and our popular Portland Potato Vodka and Coffee Rum. Mel, in my opinion, is just hitting her stride, and we at Eastside expect that she will be helping us offer our loyal customers some insanely great new spirits in the future." 
"I am excited to take on a greater leadership role with Eastside Distilling," said Melissa Heim, Executive VP of Operations.
Ms. Heim continued, "Eastside is helping Oregon make a significant contribution to the boom in craft distilling. We've been enjoying strong growth trends in whiskeys and bourbons over the last few years with increased popularity among millennials and women. Eastside plans to fully benefit from these trends by continuing to provide innovative and high quality spirits at affordable prices. I truly enjoy making and offering small batch, unique products like our beer schnapps made from local Portland beers, and our limited release bourbons aged in Oregon Oak, which is something I'm very proud we pioneered and are still the best at crafting."  
About Eastside Distilling Eastside Distilling, Inc. (OTCQB: ESDI) is located in Southeast Portland's Distillery Row, and has been producing high-quality, master crafted spirits since 2008. Makers of award winning spirits, the company is unique in the marketplace and distinguished by its highly decorated product lineup that includes Barrel Hitch American Whiskies, Burnside Bourbon, Below Deck Rums, Portland Potato Vodka, and a distinctive line of infused whiskeys. All Eastside spirits are master crafted from natural ingredients for unparalleled quality and taste. The company is publicly traded under the symbol OTCQB: ESDI.

                                Report abuseTranscript of MY NAMEmissys lifeenjoyMy name is Melissa Jane Heim. Melissa is from the greek origin and its meaning is honeybee. Heim is German and means home. Melissa also means strong,independent beatiful and intelligent woman.MY NAMEMy lifeMy life has been crazy 18 years on this earth and ive experienced a lot ! I hope you enjoyed the presentationSome BirthFactsI was born on Febuary 4th 1998 at Kaiser Permenete in Riverside, CA My Mom was 19 and my dad was 20I was a late baby and came out a month late I weighed 7 lb and 8 ozs FOODI love food and my favorite foods are chinese foods and mexican ! Orange chicken and Burritos may not be good together but alone they are AMAZINGEARLY YEARS Obviously I dont remember everything from my earliest years 1-5 years of age. I can tell you I was a well behaved child and I loved school.FAVORITE COLORI love colors !  I could never have a consistent fav color I always just bounced around and picked out my favorite but in all reality I love the rainbow I love animals , ive always had a passion for animals. Dogs , cats , birds , horses , wild animals just everything! Animals are a huge part of my life and who I am because im a total nature freakFAMILY: I have a huge family. On my mothers side and fathers side i think I have a total of 200 cousins or more. I only have 1 sibling though. Shes younger than me by 3 years. My parents are also still pretty young and Im the eldest cousin and granddaughter Ethnicity My background and ethnicity is mainly german and argentinian. I also have a lot of greek in me .. as well as indian. Im only about a half a quarter and the tribe is Black Foot.   TV shows I like to watchI dont watch much television but my favorite shows are The Walking Dead and Finding Carter these are my favorite because of the action in them. Family TraditionsFamily Traditions that we have is The Heim Christmas Party every year long long before my parents were even a thought had this tradition.My Grandparents Most my grandparents are still alive. My mom and dads side are still very alive but my great grandparents are the only ones who aren't around anymore.Memories of grandparentsMy biggest memories with my grandma is cooking. We would visit her in texas and she would overwhelm me with lots of recipes of biscuits and sweet tea, my grandpa always had me out by the cars and taught me how to work with an engine so I didnt have to be a damsel in distress.   In school In school My favorite subjects were language arts and history , my least favorite was math. I was a pretty good kid in school , I did my work and had lots of friends. I always looked foreword to school ! My friends in schoolIve always been a little more mature and thats kinda made it hard for me to connect to other kids. I always had friends i just couldnt relate on the same level. FearsI only have 1 fear and thats rollarcoasters. They terrify me! Thats the only thing that scares me though. Its just the way the adrenaline runs through ! ITS NOT FOR ME LIKES Animals , shopping , horses , dirtbackriding! I love being active and staying busy. I love all of these things ! They are apart of me.MMA 1 sport I did was MMA I did it for 4 years , My parents thought it would help with my temper which it did , It taught me self discipline and to control my anger. Although I did have to give up this amazing sport after suffering from a back injury.I also did crossfit but soon realized it wasnt for me. They were a bunch of meat heads. It was still fun though and i loved the experienceMy career , the present! This year has been a crazy crazy year. NOT the best but not the worst either. I think this is important to put in because its really  huge part of me. First it started out with working 2 fast food jobs. 1 at flame broiler and the second one was waba grill. These jobs were horrible and made me want my career even more. Medical is what I chose. Career cont..So I got into a program to allow me to learn how be a medical assistant and internship, this was big for me. I quit my other jobs and devoted all my time to the program. Career cont...After many trials and tribulations I finally got my job. I had bounced around extern site after extern site untill i finished and earned the job i have now.My current jobMy current job is a surgical assistant, I help the surgeon put in stitches and take them out. I also help with mild surgeries such as wart , mole and skin tag removals My futureI plan on going to school and becoming a surgeon, I hope that I will be successful and have awesome patients.
