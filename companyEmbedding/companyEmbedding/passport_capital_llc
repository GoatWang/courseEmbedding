Ever since the US Government passed new laws requiring passports for all travel out of the country, passport applications have been at an all-time high. This is especially true for those travelers visiting Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.

provides you no guarantee of getting your passport for weeks.
Passport expediting services exist to fill this gap. By paying a service fee (which varies, according to how fast you need your passport), you can receive your new or renewed passport in as little as 24 hours.

Choosing a Passport Company
Passport demand has significantly increased over the last several years, creating a back log of requests and many angry travelers.  Requesting a passport through the US passport agency can take as long as four to six, or longer, to process. If you've decided to utilize a passport company to help with your passport needs be aware that these companies vary greatly in several aspects and finding a solid company,
that you can count on, for a fair price will save you time and money.
There are a variety of qualities you should compare when evaluating passport companies. Some of these include:

Turnaround Time. Some passport companies are able to expedite your passport and have it in your hands in 48 hours or less.  While others need at least 5 to 7 days to deliver a new passport.  When looking for a passport company identify what their specific turnaround times are and what each time frame costs.  You'll see a significant differences in charges across many companies.
Website Functionality. When you're searching for expert advice on what is needed for your passport renewal, what you can use in place of your missing birth certificate, how to obtain more passport pages, and more you'll want a company that offers a savvy website that is easy to use and loaded with information. Also, look for websites that provide online passport status information so
that
you may feel confident in the progress of your passport application.
Expert Advice. When you are looking for expert advice on what is needed for your passport renewal, or any other challenging questions - you'll want a company that offers plenty of information either on line or via the phone. Some companies provide everything you need to know while others are short on information and big on sales pitch.
Customer Service.  Getting your needs met, reducing your panic and answering all of your complicated passport questions is what you'll want in a company that needs to produce your passport fast.  Customer service levels between passport companies can vary greatly and you'll want to choose a company where the customer is always first. Look for companies that offer several methods of communication
and have extended hours to assist you - whenever needed.

When choosing a passport company, the internet provides the best resources for investigating and locating a quality passport company that you can feel confident with.  Consider using independent product review websites to quickly locate a strong passport company. They do a good job of quickly comparing and contrasting website functionality, prices, customer service and prior performance for you.
