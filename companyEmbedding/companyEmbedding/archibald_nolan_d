Archibald joined Black & Decker as President & Chief Operating Officer in September 1985. When appointed President & Chief Executive Officer in March 1986 at the age of 42, Archibald was the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 Company. Archibald launched DeWalt in 1992 and built what is now the world’s largest professional and industrial power tools brand.He served as Chief Executive Officer for Black & Decker for 24 years. At the time of the merger with Stanley in March 2010, Archibald was the second longest serving CEO of the largest 1000 companies in the United States that were not family controlled.
Archibald is a recipient of the American Marketing Association’s Edison Achievement Award for significant and lasting contributions to marketing excellence and product innovation. He has been cited by Business Week as one of the top six managers in the United States and by Fortune Magazine as one of the country’s “ten most wanted” executives. Archibald serves as a member of the Board of Directors of Lockheed Martin Corporation, Huntsman Corporation and Brunswick Corporation. His previous board memberships include: ITT Corporation, the [[Johns Hopkins University]] Board of Trustees, the Board of Directors of the Associates of the Harvard Business School.
Education and athletics[edit]
Archibald graduated from Dixie State College (now Dixie State University) where he was an honor student and All-American basketball player. He led his team to the National Junior College finals in Hutchinson, Kansas and was recruited by over 50 major universities in the United States. Archibald graduated from Weber State University, cum laude, where he was Scholar Athlete of the Year in 1968. He was an All-Conference basketball player under Coach Dick Motta and played on Weber State’s first team to participate in the then 32-team NCAA basketball tournament. He was one of fifteen Division I basketball players out of 4,000 named an Academic All-American.
Archibald went on to earn a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School in 1970. Archibald was invited in both 1969 and 1970 to try out for the Chicago Bulls in the National Basketball Association. He was offered a contract in 1970 to play for the Pittsburgh Pipers in the American Basketball Association.
In 1993, the National Association of Basketball Coaches honored Archibald, along with four other former All-American basketball players, (including Elvin Hayes), as their “Silver Anniversary NCAA All-American Basketball Team”. Archibald is the only athlete in Weber State’s history to receive this honor.

Business[edit]
Archibald joined Black & Decker as President & Chief Operating Officer in September 1985. When appointed President & Chief Executive Officer in March 1986 at the age of 42, Archibald was the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 Company. Archibald launched DeWalt in 1992 and built what is now the world’s largest professional and industrial power tools brand.He served as Chief Executive Officer for Black & Decker for 24 years. At the time of the merger with Stanley in March 2010, Archibald was the second longest serving CEO of the largest 1000 companies in the United States that were not family controlled.
Archibald is a recipient of the American Marketing Association’s Edison Achievement Award for significant and lasting contributions to marketing excellence and product innovation. He has been cited by Business Week as one of the top six managers in the United States and by Fortune Magazine as one of the country’s “ten most wanted” executives. Archibald serves as a member of the Board of Directors of Lockheed Martin Corporation, Huntsman Corporation and Brunswick Corporation. His previous board memberships include: ITT Corporation, the [[Johns Hopkins University]] Board of Trustees, the Board of Directors of the Associates of the Harvard Business School.
Education and athletics[edit]
Archibald graduated from Dixie State College (now Dixie State University) where he was an honor student and All-American basketball player. He led his team to the National Junior College finals in Hutchinson, Kansas and was recruited by over 50 major universities in the United States. Archibald graduated from Weber State University, cum laude, where he was Scholar Athlete of the Year in 1968. He was an All-Conference basketball player under Coach Dick Motta and played on Weber State’s first team to participate in the then 32-team NCAA basketball tournament. He was one of fifteen Division I basketball players out of 4,000 named an Academic All-American.
Archibald went on to earn a Master’s Degree in Business Administration from the Harvard Business School in 1970. Archibald was invited in both 1969 and 1970 to try out for the Chicago Bulls in the National Basketball Association. He was offered a contract in 1970 to play for the Pittsburgh Pipers in the American Basketball Association.
In 1993, the National Association of Basketball Coaches honored Archibald, along with four other former All-American basketball players, (including Elvin Hayes), as their “Silver Anniversary NCAA All-American Basketball Team”. Archibald is the only athlete in Weber State’s history to receive this honor.
Personal life[edit]
Nolan Archibald and his wife, Margaret (Hafen), have seven sons and one daughter: Jason, Lance, Jared, Jordan, Anthony, Cameron, Austin and Ashley. Seven are graduates of Brigham Young University. Jared graduated from Harvard University and received an MBA from Stanford University’s School of Business. Following BYU, Jason graduated from Duke Medical School and the five-year Johns Hopkins University Orthopedic Surgery Residency Program. Five sons have graduated from the Harvard Business School. All the sons were Eagle Scouts and served missions for the LDS Church. Nolan and Margaret Archibald also have 28 grandchildren.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
