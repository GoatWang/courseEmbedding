        Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P.'s Most Brilliant Moves in 2017 So Far
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Matthew DiLallo)

        Updated 8 hrs ago





































































































Last year was an active one for Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE: BIP). The global infrastructure giant invested more than $2.8 billion in a combination of acquisitions and organic growth projects, which drove 14% growth in its funds from operations (FFO), enabling the company to increase its distribution to investors by 11%. While the company hasn't been quite as busy in 2017, it has still made some brilliant moves that will help it deliver high-end growth in the coming years.Finally getting some closureOne of the best moves Brookfield Infrastructure Partners made last year was leading a consortium to acquire a 90% stake in a natural gas transmission business in Brazil from oil giant Petrobras (NYSE: PBR). The draw is the fact that the system generates stable and growing cash flow since Petrobras locked up 100% of the volumes under long-term ship-or-pay contracts with customers that also came with full inflation indexation. It's an asset that likely wouldn't have been available at the price Brookfield paid if it wasn't for Petrobras' financial troubles and Brazil's economic and political woes.

A Brazilian federal judge initially granted an injunction against the acquisition, saying it wasn't sufficiently publicized to foster competition, thus allowing Brookfield to score such a great deal. However, the company fought that challenge and won, which enabled it to close the transaction in early April. Because of that, this acquisition should fuel robust FFO growth for Brookfield in 2017.Making a new connection in IndiaOne of Brookfield's newest operating platforms is communication towers, which it added to its portfolio in 2015 after buying a stake in the largest independent communications tower business in France. That segment is about to expand after the company signed an agreement to purchase a portfolio of mobile tower assets in India earlier this year. Brookfield expects to invest $200 million for its share in the portfolio, and it should close the deal sometime in the third quarter.What's smart about this transaction is that it provides the company with a platform from which to leverage its footprint in India by acquiring additional tower portfolios in the country. In fact, according to reports, the company is in advanced talks to buy two other smaller tower portfolios in the country. These transactions would give the company an extensive collection of communications towers in one of the fastest-growing emerging markets, which could provide immediate growth upon closing the deals as well as long-term organic expansion opportunities.Image source: Getty Images.Refilling the organic growth pipeline
After deploying $850 million in capital into organic growth projects last year, Brookfield had drained its backlog down to $1.4 billion by year-end. However, thanks to two big wins in the first quarter, the company boosted its growth pipeline back over $2 billion worth of projects, which should drive growth over the next two to three years.The largest win in the first quarter was in the company's U.K. regulated distribution business, which won the right to acquire up to 850,000 smart meters. With that award, the company has now secured 1.5 million smart meters for that business. The company expects to invest $400 million in capital to deploy these meters by 2019, which it anticipates will earn "solid risk-adjusted returns." In addition, the company's Brazilian toll road business recently won a 30-year concession to operate and expand a nearly 450-mile toll road in the country. The company paid $215 million up front and will invest up to $90 million over the next few years to expand and upgrade the road, which connects with its existing network and will widen its footprint in one of the most economically attractive regions in the country.Increased visibility to create valueBrookfield Infrastructure Partners believes it can grow its distribution to investors by 5% to 9% annually just from the embedded growth of its portfolio. That said, it has enhanced those growth prospects by making several brilliant moves this year. Because of that, the company is more likely to grow the distribution at or above the high end of its range, which should create more value for long-term investors.

        Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P.'s Most Brilliant Moves in 2017 So Far
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Matthew DiLallo)

Last year was an active one for Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE: BIP). The global infrastructure giant invested more than $2.8 billion in a combination of acquisitions and organic growth projects, which drove 14% growth in its funds from operations (FFO), enabling the company to increase its distribution to investors by 11%. While the company hasn't been quite as busy in 2017, it has still made some brilliant moves that will help it deliver high-end growth in the coming years.Finally getting some closureOne of the best moves Brookfield Infrastructure Partners made last year was leading a consortium to acquire a 90% stake in a natural gas transmission business in Brazil from oil giant Petrobras (NYSE: PBR). The draw is the fact that the system generates stable and growing cash flow since Petrobras locked up 100% of the volumes under long-term ship-or-pay contracts with customers that also came with full inflation indexation. It's an asset that likely wouldn't have been available at the price Brookfield paid if it wasn't for Petrobras' financial troubles and Brazil's economic and political woes. 
Image source: Getty Images.With Brookfield expecting to earn a low-teens annual return given its purchase price, its top priority this year was to close the deal, which was easier said than done. A Brazilian federal judge initially granted an injunction against the acquisition, saying it wasn't sufficiently publicized to foster competition, thus allowing Brookfield to score such a great deal. However, the company fought that challenge and won, which enabled it to close the transaction in early April. Because of that, this acquisition should fuel robust FFO growth for Brookfield in 2017.Making a new connection in IndiaOne of Brookfield's newest operating platforms is communication towers, which it added to its portfolio in 2015 after buying a stake in the largest independent communications tower business in France. That segment is about to expand after the company signed an agreement to purchase a portfolio of mobile tower assets in India earlier this year. Brookfield expects to invest $200 million for its share in the portfolio, and it should close the deal sometime in the third quarter.What's smart about this transaction is that it provides the company with a platform from which to leverage its footprint in India by acquiring additional tower portfolios in the country. In fact, according to reports, the company is in advanced talks to buy two other smaller tower portfolios in the country. These transactions would give the company an extensive collection of communications towers in one of the fastest-growing emerging markets, which could provide immediate growth upon closing the deals as well as long-term organic expansion opportunities.Image source: Getty Images.Refilling the organic growth pipeline
After deploying $850 million in capital into organic growth projects last year, Brookfield had drained its backlog down to $1.4 billion by year-end. However, thanks to two big wins in the first quarter, the company boosted its growth pipeline back over $2 billion worth of projects, which should drive growth over the next two to three years.The largest win in the first quarter was in the company's U.K. regulated distribution business, which won the right to acquire up to 850,000 smart meters. With that award, the company has now secured 1.5 million smart meters for that business. The company expects to invest $400 million in capital to deploy these meters by 2019, which it anticipates will earn "solid risk-adjusted returns." In addition, the company's Brazilian toll road business recently won a 30-year concession to operate and expand a nearly 450-mile toll road in the country. The company paid $215 million up front and will invest up to $90 million over the next few years to expand and upgrade the road, which connects with its existing network and will widen its footprint in one of the most economically attractive regions in the country.Increased visibility to create valueBrookfield Infrastructure Partners believes it can grow its distribution to investors by 5% to 9% annually just from the embedded growth of its portfolio. That said, it has enhanced those growth prospects by making several brilliant moves this year. Because of that, the company is more likely to grow the distribution at or above the high end of its range, which should create more value for long-term investors.

Brookfield Infrastructure Partners is a publicly traded (NYSE: BIP) (TSX: BIP.UN) limited partnershipwith corporate headquarters in Toronto, Canada, that engages in the acquisition and management of infrastructure assets on a global basis.[2]
Until a spin-off in January 2008, Brookfield Infrastructure was an operating unit of Brookfield Asset Management, which retains a 30 percent ownership and acts as the partnership's general manager.[3] The company's assets carried a book value of US$21.3 billion, on December 31, 2016.[4]
Brookfield Infrastructure Partners owns and operates a global network of infrastructure companies in utilities, transportation, energy and communications infrastructure. It invests in transmission and telecommunication lines, toll roads, ports and pipelines. The company has an equity market capitalization of about US$11.8 billion with an investment-return target of 12 to 15 percent.[5] Its annualized total returns since inception have been 18% on the NYSE and 26% on the TSX.[4]
Sam Pollock is the chief executive officer of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners.[6] He has held this position since 2006, and has been with Brookfield Asset Management since 1994.[7]
Operations[edit]
After the spin-off from Brookfield Asset Management, Brookfield Infrastructure operated timber properties and electricity transmission lines. In September 2008, the company announced it would expand and diversify its global operations by buying infrastructure holdings from distressed Babcock & Brown, thus adding approximately US$8 billion of assets under management.[8][9]
In 2010 the company completed a merger with Australian company Prime Infrastructure in which it held a minority interest.[10]
In 2012, the company participated in a joint venture with Spain’s Abertis Infraestructuras to purchase 60 percent of toll operator Obrascon Huarte Lain Brasil in a deal valued at US$1.7 billion.[11]
Also in 2012, the company and its partners agreed to acquire the remaining 45% of the AVN toll road in Chile for a total purchase price of $590-million, after making an initial investment in 2011.[12]
In 2014, the company and its investment partners agreed to acquire 50% of the French telecommunications units of TDF for $2.2 billion.[13]
In 2016, the company announced an agreement with Qube Holdings and other investment partners to buy Asciano Ltd. an Australian rail and port operator, for US $6.55 billion, (A$8.9 billion.)[14] That same year, the company also announced that it and its investment partners would acquire a 90% stake in a Brazilian natural gas pipeline from Petroleo Brasileiro SA for US $5.2 billion.[15]
The company made over $2 billion of new investments in 2016, including its first ventures into businesses in Peru and India. The company also invested in organic projects valued at $850 million, growing the size of its utilities rate base, road and rail networks and energy systems.[16][17]

(together with its subsidiaries other than the Filer and its subsidiaries, Brookfield) and its related entities to provide management, administrative and advisory services under a master services agreement. Following the Reorganization, New US Holdco will also retain Brookfield for the provision of such services by becoming a party to the master services agreement.
7. The Filer is not in default of any requirement of the Legislation or equivalent legislation in any of the Jurisdictions.
8. In connection with an offering of debt securities by the Debt Issuers, the Filer applied for and was granted substantially the same exemptive relief as the Exemption Sought pursuant to a June 26, 2012 decision document (the 2012 Decision).
The Reorganization
9. Pursuant to the Reorganization, the Holding LP will incorporate a new subsidiary under the laws of the State of Delaware (New US Holdco).
10. New US Holdco will be authorized to issue 500,000 common shares initially and one preferred share (the New US Holdco Preferred Share). The Holding LP will own all of the common shares of New US Holdco. An indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield will own the New US Holdco Preferred Share, which will have an aggregate value of US$5 million. The New US Holdco Preferred Share will be redeemable for cash at the option of New US Holdco, subject to certain limitations, and because of certain US tax implications, will be entitled to vote (one vote per share). The New US Holdco Preferred Share will not be an equity security as such term is defined in the Act. The issuance of the New US Holdco Preferred Share will be exempt from the requirements of MI 61-101 because the fair market value of that share will be less than 25% of the market capitalization of the Filer.
11. New US Holdco will own all of the issued and outstanding voting securities of Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation, currently a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, which will be converted to a Delaware limited liability company named Brookfield Infrastructure LLC in connection with the Reorganization (US Holdco). All of the issued and outstanding voting securities of US Holdco are currently owned by the Holding LP. In connection with the conversion, all of the issued and outstanding preferred shares of US Holdco will be converted into common shares of US Holdco.
12. Following the Reorganization, New US Holdco will execute a guarantee and become a guarantor of the Securities (as defined below) and US Holdco will continue to be a guarantor of the Existing Debt Securities (as defined below) pursuant to the existing guarantee to which it is a party.
13. Following the Reorganization, the Filer will no longer satisfy the conditions of the 2012 Decision because a party other than the Filer, Brookfield, the Infrastructure General Partner (as defined below) and the Holding LP will have a direct ownership of the voting securities of US Holdco.
The Issuers and the Holding LP
14. The Debt Issuers have issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of debt securities (the Existing Debt Securities) guaranteed by the Filer, the Holding LP and each of the Holding Entities except New US Holdco. The Debt Issuers may, subject to market conditions, issue additional debt securities (the New Debt Securities, and together with the Existing Debt Securities, the Debt Securities), any new series of which will be guaranteed by the Filer, the Holding LP and each of the Holding Entities except US Holdco.
15. The Existing Debt Securities were jointly issued, and any New Debt Securities will be jointly issued, by Brookfield Infrastructure Finance ULC, an Alberta unlimited liability company (the CDN Debt Issuer), Brookfield Infrastructure Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the US Issuer), Brookfield Infrastructure Finance Pty Ltd, a proprietary company limited by shares incorporated in Australia (the AUS Issuer) and Brookfield Infrastructure Finance Limited, a Bermuda corporation (the BRM Issuer, together with the CDN Debt Issuer, the US Issuer and the AUS Issuer, the Debt Issuers), each an entity that is in effect an indirect subsidiary of the Filer.
16. Brookfield Infrastructure Preferred Equity Inc. (the CDN Pref Issuer, and together with the Debt Issuers, the Issuers) will be an issuer of preferred shares (the Preferred Shares and together with the Debt Securities, the Securities), which will be guaranteed by the Filer, the Holding LP and each of the Holding Entities except US Holdco. No Preferred Shares are currently outstanding.
17. The Issuers were formed under the laws of their respective jurisdictions in May 2012 prior to the filing of a preliminary short form prospectus for an offering of Securities and are currently reporting issuers in all of the Jurisdictions and not in default of any requirement of the Legislation or equivalent legislation in any of the Jurisdictions.
18. The CDN Debt Issuer and the CDN Pref Issuer are each a wholly-owned subsidiary of Brookfield Infrastructure Holdings (Canada) Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the Province of Ontario (Can Holdco); the US Issuer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of US Holdco; and the AUS Issuer and the BRM Issuer are each wholly-owned subsidiaries of BIP Bermuda Holdings I Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda (BRM Holdco, and together with Can Holdco, US Holdco and New US Holdco, the Holding Entities).
19. Following the Reorganization, the Holding LP will own all of the common shares of all the Holding Entities except US Holdco and Brookfield will own all of the preferred shares of all the applicable Holding Entities (the Holdco Preferred Shares). New US Holdco will own all of the common shares of US Holdco. The Holdco Preferred Shares will be redeemable for cash at the option of the Holding Entities, subject to certain limitations, and, except for the New US Holdco Preferred Share, will not be entitled to vote, except as required by law. The Holdco Preferred Shares will not be equity securities as such term is defined in the Act.
20. All of the outstanding voting securities of each Issuer are held directly or indirectly by the respective Holding Entity that is its parent.
21. The Filer owns approximately 70.5% of the outstanding limited partnership interest in the Holding LP with the remaining limited partnership interest held by Brookfield. The limited partnership units of the Holding LP held by Brookfield are subject to a redemption-exchange mechanism pursuant to which Brookfield has the right to require that the Holding LP redeem all or a portion of its limited partnership units of the Holding LP for a cash amount equal to the fair market value of one Unit multiplied by the number of limited partnership units of the Holding LP to be redeemed. In connection with the redemption, the Filer has the right to purchase all the limited partnership units of the Holding LP to be redeemed in exchange for Units on a one for one basis.
22. The Managing General Partner has a 0.01% general partnership interest in the Filer and acts as the general partner of the Filer and Brookfield Infrastructure GP L.P. (the Infrastructure General Partner) has an approximate 0.5% general partnership interest in the Holding LP and acts as the general partner of the Holding LP.
23. The Managing General Partner and the Infrastructure General Partner are wholly-owned by Brookfield.
24. In December 2010, the Filer and Brookfield executed a voting agreement (the Voting Agreement) pursuant to which Brookfield agreed that any voting rights with respect to the Holding LP and the Infrastructure General Partner (including its general partner) will be voted in accordance with the direction of the Filer with respect to: (a) the election of directors of the general partner of the Infrastructure General Partner (provided such directors meet the eligibility requirements stipulated in the by-laws of the general partner); and (b) the approval or rejection of the following matters relating to any such entity, as applicable: (i) any sale of all or substantially all of its assets; (ii) any merger, amalgamation, consolidation, business combination or other material corporate transaction, except in connection with any internal reorganization that does not result in a change of control; (iii) any plan or proposal for a complete or partial liquidation or dissolution, or any reorganization or any case, proceeding or action seeking relief under any existing laws or future laws relating to bankruptcy or insolvency; (iv) any amendment to the limited partnership agreement of the Filer or the Holding LP; or (v) any commitment or agreement to do any of the foregoing. As a result, the Filer has consolidated the Holding LP (and all of the Holding LP's assets, including the Holding Entities other than New US Holdco) into its financial statements. Following the Reorganization, New US Holdco will also be consolidated in the financial statements of the Filer.
25. On completion of the Reorganization, the Filer, the Holding LP and the Holding Entities will be "credit supporters" (as defined in NI 51-102).
26. Each of the Issuers operates as a financing company and has no significant assets or liabilities unrelated to the Securities and does not have any ongoing business operations of its own.
27. Each Issuer will be a "credit support issuer" (as defined in NI 51-102).
28. The Filer does not directly satisfy the definition of "parent credit supporter" (as defined in NI 51-102) as a result of the indirect ownership of the Issuers through the Holding LP. Therefore, the Securities will not be "designated credit support securities" (as defined in NI 51-102). If the Exemption Sought is granted, the Filer and each Issuer will: (a) treat the Filer as a parent credit supporter and comply with the conditions in section 13.4(2.1) of NI 51-102 that apply to parent credit supporters; and (b) treat the Debt Securities, the Preferred Shares and the Resulting Preferred Shares (as defined below) as designated credit support securities and comply with the conditions in section 13.4(2.1) of NI 51-102 that apply to designated credit support securities, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the decision.
29. The Preferred Shares will be issuable in one or more series having such rights, restrictions and privileges determined by the directors of the CDN Pref Issuer.
30. The Preferred Shares will satisfy the definition of "designated credit support securities" (as defined in NI 51-102), but for: (a) the fact that the Filer does not directly satisfy the definition of "parent credit supporter" (as defined in NI 51-102); and (b) the Preferred Shares may be convertible, in certain circumstances, at the option of the holder or the CDN Pref Issuer, into Preferred Shares of another series (the Resulting Preferred Shares).
31. The CDN Pref Issuer does not directly satisfy the eligibility criteria in Part 2 of NI 44-101 in order to be able to file a prospectus in the form of a short form prospectus for Preferred Shares that are convertible into Resulting Preferred Shares.
32. The Filer does not meet the test set forth in section 13.4(2)(a) of NI 51-102 and, by virtue of section 13.4(4) of NI 51-102, is unable to meet the test set forth in section 13.4(2)(b)(ii) of NI 51-102.
33. The Issuers have filed a short form base shelf prospectus dated July 12, 2012 in each of the Jurisdictions, in reliance upon section 2.4 of NI 44-101 and National Instrument 44-102 -- Shelf Distributions (NI 44-102), which qualifies for distribution to the public C$750,000,000 of Securities. Any future prospectus will be prepared pursuant to the short form procedures contained in NI 44-101 and, if applicable, NI 44-102 and will comply with the requirements set out in Form 44-101F1 and, if applicable, NI 44-102, other than the Prospectus Disclosure Requirements.
34. The Debt Securities are governed by a trust indenture dated as of October 10, 2012 among the Debt Issuers and Computershare Trust Company of Canada, as trustee, as supplemented (the Indenture). Under the terms of the Indenture, the Debt Issuers are jointly and severally liable for the Debt Securities.
35. Following the Reorganization, the Filer, the Holding LP and each of the Holding Entities (other than US Holdco with respect to any new series of Securities) will, and other subsidiary entities (as defined in MI 61-101) of the Holding LP (collectively with the Filer, the Holding LP and each of the applicable Holding Entities, the Guarantors) may provide full and unconditional joint and several guarantees (collectively, the Guarantees) of the payments to be made by the Issuers in respect of the Debt Securities, the Preferred Shares and the Resulting Preferred Shares (if applicable), as stipulated in agreements governing the rights of holders of the Debt Securities, the Preferred Shares and the Resulting Preferred Shares (if applicable), that result in the holders of such securities being entitled to receive payment from the Guarantors within 15 days of any failure by the Issuers to make a payment, as contemplated by paragraph (d) of the definition of "designated credit support security" in NI 51-102.
Offering of Securities
36. At the time of the filing of any short form prospectus or shelf prospectus supplement in connection with an offering of Securities:

(a) each Issuer will comply with all of the filing requirements and procedures set out in NI 44-101, other than the Qualification Requirements in the case of the CDN Pref Issuer, and, if applicable, NI 44-102, except as permitted by the Legislation;
(b) the prospectus will be prepared in accordance with the short form prospectus requirements of NI 44-101 and, if applicable, NI 44-102 other than the Prospectus Disclosure Requirements, except as permitted by the Legislation;
(c) the Filer will continue to exercise its voting rights in accordance with the Voting Agreement;
(d) the Filer will continue to be a reporting issuer under the Legislation;
(e) the prospectus will incorporate by reference the documents of the Filer set forth under Item 11.1 of Form 44-101F1;
(f) the prospectus disclosure required by Item 11 of Form 44-101F1 will be addressed by incorporating by reference the Filer's public disclosure documents referred to in paragraph 36(e) above; and
(g) the Filer will continue to satisfy all of the criteria in section 2.2 of NI 44-101, as applicable, pursuant to Part 4 of NI 71-102.

37. Prior to issuing any New Debt Securities:

(a) the Filer will provide its Guarantee in respect of the New Debt Securities; and
(b) the Issuers will be jointly and severally liable for the New Debt Securities under the Indenture.

38. Prior to issuing any Preferred Shares, the Filer will provide its Guarantee in respect of such Preferred Shares and any Resulting Preferred Shares (if applicable).

The Essential Features of Cloud ERP

		Introduction
For businesses facing the challenges of a fast-paced, global marketplace, the cloud has become
an appealing alternative to traditional on-premises deployments. Opting for cloud-based ERP,
particularly software as a service (SaaS) ERP, can save manufacturers time and money while giving
them access to the capabilities they need to stay competitive -- including anywhere, anytime access
to ERP data.
As the cloud ERP software market expands and matures, organizations would be wise to evaluate
the cloud's effects, now and in the future. But despite the benefits of flexibility, cost savings
and scalability, putting ERP in the cloud is not yet the best choice for every organization. Many
continue to proceed with caution, often because cloud-based ERP requires moving data outside
company walls. While the benefits may eventually outweigh the risks, it's a good idea to devise a
plan for data security and governance, or even consider a hybrid deployment that leaves the most
sensitive data in-house.
In this guide, learn more about major trends and vendors in the ERP market, discover some best
practices for getting the most out of a cloud deployment, and read some real-world examples that
explore the ups and downs of the journey to cloud-based ERP.


1Trends-

Trends in cloud-based ERP

2Best practices-

Finding the best path to cloud-based ERP
A major part of the cloud ERP decision is calculating return on investment (ROI). As companies come to terms with the inevitability of the cloud, they strive to find the approach that will offer them the best payoff down the road. The articles in this section explain the many forms of cloud ROI and the various ways to approach the cloud. Even organizations that decide to keep ERP on-premises for now should recognize that the cloud remains on the horizon, and should plan accordingly. 


Opinion
