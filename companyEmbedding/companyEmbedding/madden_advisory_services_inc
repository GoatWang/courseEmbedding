Our Firm
Madden Advisory Services, Inc. is an independent, fee-only firm, specializing in customized Personal Financial Planning and Asset Management. Our firm provides a broad spectrum of financial services, delivered by Certified Financial Planners®. The CFP® mark assures you that our planners are dedicated to the highest professional standards of education, ethics, experience and excellence. In today’s complex financial environment, with constant advertisements for products and services, even the most savvy of investors can be left confused. As an independently owned firm, we have no proprietary products, no quotas, and no commission schedules. We answer only to our clients and their needs. Our clients’ assets are held by independent custodians.Flexibility - Because your circumstances or objectives may change, your financial plan should not be etched in stone. To make it flexible, our planners work to develop your customized plan, provide on-going review, and make periodic adjustments or enhancements that directly respond to your changing situations and needs.Advanced Financial Planning Tools - As the profession of financial planning grows, its tools become more advanced. Our firm can develop your plan using specialized computer software. Our services include business evaluations, retirement income planning, estate projections, and alternate planning strategies, including charitable gifting.Professional Associations - Our planners can tap the talents and specializations of their fellow associates when necessary. These relationships are particularly helpful when a complex financial plan is being prepared. During preparation, and especially during implementation and execution of your plan, your planner can work with other professionals (attorneys, accountants, etc.) who advise you concerning your financial affairs.
