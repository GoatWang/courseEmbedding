Stryker Poised on Solid Product Portfolio and Acquisitions


July 18, 2017, 10:05:00 AM EDT

 On Jul 17, we issued an updated research report on Kalamazoo, MI-based Stryker Corporation SYK  , one of the largest medical device companies in the global orthopedic market. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company has a diversified product portfolio which cushions it against any significant sales shortfall during economic downturns. Stryker's pipeline includes products for Hip, Knee and Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgeries. MAKO results in the last quarter were solid, with almost 18 global robot installations, of which 11 were in the U.S. Furthermore, the platforms of bone cement, sports-medicine, bones substitute, soft tissue repair, trauma and extremities, endoscopy and more fortify the company's market position. Stryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost its growth profile. In June, the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire NOVADAQ Technologies Inc. for $11.75 per share, or $701 million with a net purchase price of $654 million. The transaction is structured as an arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by NOVADAQ's shareholders. Additionally, the acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control added $245 million to the company's net sales in the last quarter. Stryker has been focusing on international growth as well. In particular, the company's Medsurg product line has witnessed strong demand in the European and Australian markets in the first quarter of 2017. On the flip side, China might prove to be a challenging market. Stryker's strong guidance is also a catalyst. For the second quarter of 2017, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.48-$1.52 per share. For the full year, the company estimates adjusted earnings in the band of $6.35-$6.45. Stryker expects organic sales growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for full-year 2017. Over the last six months, the stock represented a strong return of 18.6%, higher than the Zacks classified Medical - Products  sub-industry's gain of 17.3%. The current level is also significantly higher than the S&P 500's return of 8.9% over the same time frame.     Other Key Picks  A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW  , CryoLife, Inc. CRY  and EDAP TMS SA EDAP  . Notably, EDAP TMS sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences and CryoLife have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here  .  EDAP TMS represents an impressive return of 37.05% for the last three months. The company delivered a solid earnings surprise of 533.3% in the last reported quarter. Edwards Lifesciences has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.2%. Notably, the stock represents an impressive one-year return of 9.6%. CryoLife yielded a strong return of 9.6% over the last one month. The stock delivered a positive earnings surprise of 80% in the last reported quarter.  5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   Policies  If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course. Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

Novadaq, the leader in fluorescent imaging technology, is a Canadian company established in 2000. Novadaq technology gives surgeons surgical visualization capabilities. The technology is expected to complement Stryker’s advanced imaging portfolio and enhance the company’s surgical offerings. The technology will also help accelerate Stryker’s focus on providing solutions and services to customers aimed at a lower cost. Novadaq’s portfolio is expected to be integrated with Stryker’s MedSurg business.



Deal synergies
Stryker expects the deal to dilute the adjusted net EPS (earnings per share) by $0.03–$0.05 per share in 2017. However, the adjusted 2017 EPS forecast continues to be $6.35–$6.45. The acquisition is expected to be neutral in 2018 and accretive thereafter.
Management’s views
Timothy J. Scannell, Stryker’s Group President, MedSurg, and NeuroTechnology, said, “This acquisition aligns with our focus on enabling our customers to see and do more by enhancing cross-specialty surgical visualization. Novadaq’s unique, innovative technology complements our advanced imaging portfolio and expands our product offerings into open and plastic reconstructive surgery. Their innovative technology can reduce post-procedure complication rates and the cost of care for a broad variety of surgical treatments.”
Rival bidder for Novadaq?
According to Canaccord Genuity analyst Jason Mills, a competitive bid might emerge for Novadaq from the likes of Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Medtronic (MDT), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). He thinks Novadaq’s portfolio is a potential strategic fit for all of these companies.
Any events related to the deal might trigger stock price changes for Stryker stock and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). VOO has ~0.26% of its total holdings in Stryker.
Next, we’ll discuss the company’s recent product approval in Stryker’s interventional spine segment.

Trump admin considering new sanctions on China over North Korea ties




				 16 July, 2017,  03:40 | Author: Hope Soto			















 


 
 
 

"If Trump were to give up on Chinese support in terms of containing North Korea, then there's a risk of increased trade tensions between the US and China, which could negatively impact China's overall export performance", said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.The new measures would target select companies and minor financial firms but no big banks, and could be announced within a matter of weeks, according to the report.China, North Korea's most important economic partner, has been increasing restrictions against North Korean activity in the country.After Trump publicly pressed Beijing to rein in economic support for the rogue regime, trade between China and North Korea grew more than 37 percent in the first quarter, a statistic available in April but which Trump didn't publicly acknowledge until last week.But Beijing is also eager to avoid riling Trump.New Defense Minister Song Young-moo vowed to drastically "reform" South Korea's military in the face of growing provocations from the North, saying Friday during an inaugural speech in Seoul that achieving "self-reliant defense capabilities" was the goal.

					Grande lotta per superare l'ultimo taglio, tutti in pista per l'ultimo giro: le Ferrari si mettono davanti ma Hamilton le passa. LA DIRETTA E LA DIFFERITA TV - La gara sarà visibile in diretta su Sky e in differita sulla Rai .
					The new data reflects China's attempt to pull off a delicate balancing act between the USA and North Korea, where it wants to prevent the regime collapsing because it worries about what that would mean for regional stability.The 68-year-old had come under fire for driving under the influence of alcohol in 1991 and for playing golf in his post-retirement years on anniversaries of such national tragedies as the sinking of the Cheonan warship and North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong Island.China insists none of its current trade with Pyongyang is in violation of worldwide sanctions.On Wednesday, China's foreign ministry bristled at questions about ongoing trade with Pyongyang that seems to skirt United Nations sanctions meant to isolate the regime - and reiterated its hostility to broader economic sanctions. "UN Security Council sanctions are not a total ban on shipments".Whether the new penalties are put in place will depend on how a high-level economic meeting between US and Chinese officials in Washington next week goes and on how China responds to USA pressure on Pyongyang, according to Reuters.

Babe Parilli, Bear Bryant's first championship QB, dead at age 87
Postado Julho 16, 2017





Vito "Babe" Parilli, a member of the Patriots' Hall of Fame and one of the greatest quarterbacks in the history of the American Football League, has died at the age of 87.Parilli lettered three years at quarterback for the Wildcats and set Kentucky records for touchdowns with 50, leading United Kingdom to wins over Oklahoma in the Sugar Bowl and TCU in the Cotton Bowl.He was a consensus All-American in 1950 and 1951. He was an AFL All-Star for the Patriots in '63, '64 and '66.The fourth overall pick in the 1952 NFL draft, Parilli bounced around six franchises (five in the AFL/NFL and one in the CFL) during a career that spanned almost two decades. He racked up 31 touchdown passes in 1964, which stood as a Patriot record until Tom Brady broke it in 2007. His career ended with the New York Jets where he earned a Super Bowl ring as Joe Namath's back-up in Super Bowl II.

Product Features


Dermacell is decellularized using Matracell, a proprietary and patented technology that removes at least 97% of donor DNA without compromising the desired biomechanical structure or biochemical properties for its intended use.
After being rendered acellular, Dermacell undergoes a terminal sterilization step to ensure a Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) of 10-6.
Low-dose gamma irradiation performed at ultra-low temperatures is used to reach surgical device-grade sterility, which lowers the probability of an active organism in the graft to 1 in 1,000,000 – lower than 10-3 or, a 1 in a 1,000 chance.

Company Profile





Changing the way you see your patients









NOVADAQ’s global mission is to enable physicians with point-of-care imaging solutions that provide real time clinically significant and actionable information to improve care quality and lower healthcare costs. Using NOVADAQ’s SPY fluorescence imaging technology, physicians can personalize therapy and achieve optimal results through the precise visualization of blood flow in vessels, micro-vessels, tissue perfusion and critical anatomical structures during the course of treatment. SPY technology enables the delivery of personalized therapies and the achievement of the optimal results for each individual patient.
More than 260 peer-reviewed publications demonstrate that the use of SPY technology will reduce post-procedure complication rates and the cost of care for a broad variety of surgical treatments for cancer, cardiovascular diseases and other conditions, helping to ensure that patients benefit from the very best possible treatment and outcome.


SPY Fluorescence Imaging Systems are United States Food and Drug Administration 510(k) cleared, Health Canada licensed, CE Marked and registered worldwide for use in multiple surgical specialities and medical applications.
The endoscopic version of SPY technology, known as PINPOINT, combines the fluorescence imaging capabilities of SPY with the high definition visible light visualization to establish a new standard in the quality and performance of minimally invasive surgery.
NOVADAQ’s SPY PHI Portable Handheld Imager, combines the imaging modes of both the SPY Elite and PINPOINT systems into an easy to use point and shoot imaging platform that allows surgeons to visualize blood flow in vessels and related tissue perfusion during plastic, microsurgical, reconstructive and gastrointestinal procedures.
NOVADAQ’s LUNA System is used to visualize blood flow and tissue perfusion while treating patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that impairs blood flow to the extremities and increases the risk for the development of complications such as acute and chronic non-healing wounds and limb loss.

Alliances
In addition to the company’s direct sales, NOVADAQ has formed alliances with leading companies in certain markets in which SPY Imaging and the SPY technology platform has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs.






Intuitive Surgical Alliance
In January 2009, NOVADAQ announced an alliance with Intuitive Surgical®, Inc., to develop a SPY Imaging system to be integrated into the da Vinci Surgical Robotic System (as integrated, the “FIREFLY System”) and to become the exclusive supplier of certain hardware components of the FIREFLY System and the fluorescence agent required to perform procedures.



Lifenet Health Alliance
In December 2014, LifeNet Health and NOVADAQ jointly announced an agreement whereby Novadaq became the exclusive worldwide distributor of LifeNet Health’s DermACELL tissue products. DermACELL is a technologically advanced Acellular Dermal Matrix that can be used in breast reconstruction surgeries, as well as in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers and chronic non-healing wounds for use in wound and breast reconstruction surgery.



Maquet Alliance
In January 2012, NOVADAQ named MAQUET Cardiovascular the exclusive United States distributor of the TMR Heart Laser System and the associated disposable products. TMR is a procedure aimed at improving blood flow to areas of the heart that cannot be successfully  treated by alternative standard revascularization techniques and is often performed adjunctively with CABG.



Arthrex Alliance
In October 2015, NOVADAQ entered into a Co-Marketing Agreement with Arthrex, Inc. allowing the two companies to combine their devices by integrating NOVADAQ’s “plug and play” PINPOINT upgrade kit into Arthrex’s Synergy System to enable Fluorescence Imaging. Both companies continue to sell their own standalone systems in addition to selling the combined systems. NOVADAQ directly supplies clinical support for the PINPOINT System and related disposable kits required to perform fluorescence imaging to Arthrex customers who purchase upgrade kits.

Fewer complications lead to lower healthcare costs
Published literature has long demonstrated the significant costs associated with surgical complications. This data was taken from a study conducted at the Cleveland Clinic that compared the estimated average cost of care for patients that developed mastectomy flap necrosis (n=5) to patients with no wound healing issues (n=5). The results were estimated to be $22,659 in increased cost per patient in the group that developed mastectomy flap necrosis.2

Cardiac Surgery





SPY Imaging in Cardiac Surgery
Nearly 400,000 Americans undergo coronary artery bypass surgery, also known as “CABG”, each year.  CABG is performed to treat blockages in coronary arteries that are typically caused by fatty build up or “atherosclerotic plaque” that develops on the vessel walls.  Blockages interfere with normal blood flow to the heart muscle, often resulting in patient symptoms such as excessive sweating, left arm, jaw or chest pain.  As blockages become more severe, they can lead to irregular heart rhythms, heart attack or “myocardial infarction” and in the worst cases, sudden death. During the performance of CABG, surgeons typically use a vessel from the chest wall and/ or the lower leg to create a “detour” or bypass for blood to flow from the aorta to the native coronary artery past the location of the blockage. Bypass grafts are intended to restore adequate blood flow or “perfusion” to the heart muscle.




Overview

Clinical References










SPY Fluorescence Imaging technology enables surgeons to treat every patient as a unique individual and to perform the most optimal procedure for that specific person. During CABG surgery, SPY allows cardiac surgeons to visually assess the quality of blood flow in native coronary arteries, bypass grafts and the micro-vessels supplying blood to myocardial tissue while in the operating room. If, during the course of creating the bypass grafts, the surgeon observes that blood flow has not been optimally restored, the surgeon can decide if revisions to the grafts should be performed. SPY imaging is the only method that allows surgeons to see blood flow in coronary vessels and tissue during the operation and to make modifications to optimize revascularization during the operation. SPY imaging does not involve ionizing radiation or nephrotoxicity, which potentially can be harmful to some patients.
SPY imaging has been the topic of a substantial body of evidence supporting its use in CABG surgery.  In 2009, cardiac surgeon researchers presented results from 350 patients undergoing CABG including SPY imaging enrolled in the VICTORIA Multicenter Registry. VICTORIA data showed that the complication rates, including reoperation and long length of stay, were 50% lower than expected compared to similar patients enrolled in the Society of Thoracic Surgeon’s (STS) national cardiac database. The STS database is one of the longest standing and largest existing medical data sets that exists today.


The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid independently studied cost data in 2008 and 2009, and concluded that the use of SPY in CABG resulted in average cost reductions of $2,000 – $4,000 per patient. In today’s healthcare environment, cost savings resulting from reductions in complications are critical to achieving the goals of healthcare reform. Medicare established ICD-9-code 88.59 to describe the use of SPY in coronary artery bypass surgery.
A Sentara Heart Hospital independent study of more than 700 patients undergoing CABG demonstrated that total costs of CABG were 4.2% lower and average length of stay 6-16% lower in 358 patients where the CABG procedure included SPY Imaging versus the 225 cases performed without SPY.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
