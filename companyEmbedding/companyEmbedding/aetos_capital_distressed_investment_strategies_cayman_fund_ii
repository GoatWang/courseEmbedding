Strategies for Investing in Uncertain Markets
In an uncertain market, one thing is certain: Market declines are an inevitable part of investing.
These 5 investment strategies can help you ride out the bumps and keep your eyes on the big picture.












Stay Calm and Get Professional Advice

Avoid making quick moves on your own, as tempting as it may be. Instead, meet with your financial professional and share your concerns.
Resist making decisions on the basis of single events.
Re-examine your investment goals, time horizon and risk tolerance with your financial professional to make sure they remain appropriate.




 






Maintain a Diversified Investment Portfolio

Work with your financial professional to spread your risks.
Consider selecting a mix of mutual funds that invests in stocks and bonds. Additionally, keeping an appropriate amount of your portfolio in money market or cash equivalent mutual funds and other liquid investments can help you meet short-term needs. 
Include funds that invest outside the United States. Non-U.S. markets often move in their own market cycles.
Diversification doesn’t guarantee a profit, but over time it can help to reduce the effects of volatility.


Maintain a Diversified Investment Portfolio




 






Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times















Avoid moving everything into stocks at the hint of good news — or everything into cash following bad news.
Instead of fearing a down market, view it as an opportunity to buy shares at potentially lower prices.
Consider investing a fixed amount every month or quarter, a strategy known as dollar cost averaging. You won’t have to guess which way the market is going. You also won't risk the possibility of investing all of your money at the top of the market. (Please note that this strategy of regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.)


Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times


Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times




 






Invest for Income

Consider mutual funds that stress the role of dividends — or bond funds that produce a steady stream of interest payments.
Income-producing investments can provide a cushion during a down stock market. After all, a dividend is yours whether the stock price is rising or falling. 


Invest for Income




 






Avoid Jumping In and Out of the Market

Successful market timing during a bear market is extremely difficult because it requires two near-perfect actions: getting out at the right time and getting back in at the right time. As a result, investors typically end up buying high and selling low.
One reason it’s difficult: A bear market is not usually characterized by a straight-line decline in stock prices. Instead, it tends to be jagged — showing bursts of stock price increases and then declines that bring with them corresponding feelings of euphoria and concern.

 Staying the Course 
 


















Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 


Regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss. Investors should consider their willingness to keep investing when share prices are declining.

 Fed Rate Decision: Near-Zero For Now, But Higher Soon?  












The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates close to zero, as concern about global economic conditions cast a shadow over an otherwise fairly bright outlook for the U.S. economy.
Looking forward, the Fed is expected to raise rates gradually, and an increase of 0.25%, for example, would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy.
Over time, higher interest rates can be beneficial for bond investors, enabling reinvestment in issues offering higher yields.
Rising rates have a varied impact on stocks. Selective investors who emphasize company-specific research should continue to find attractive longer term income and return opportunities.

 MARKET COMMENTARY   |  September 2015  |  FEATURING Timothy D. Armour & Robert W. Lovelace 
 Q&A With Portfolio Managers Tim Armour and Rob Lovelace  











Perspective on Recent Market Selloff Triggered by China Woes
Global stocks have tumbled in recent days amid investor concerns about slowing economic growth in China. A sharp decline in Chinese stocks and a surprise currency devaluation have further stoked fears that the outlook for China is deteriorating, and events there could hurt its global trading partners, including Japan, Europe and ultimately the United States. China lowered interest rates and eased reserve requirements on banks in an attempt to calm investors and stimulate the economy. Against this backdrop, portfolio managers Tim Armour and Rob Lovelace share their thoughts on the unfolding events:

China now accounts for roughly 15% of the world’s gross domestic product and therefore has a greater impact than ever before on the global economy.
The most significant catalyst of the selloff was China’s unexpected decision to devalue its currency, delivering a shock to financial markets.

Global stocks plummeted as fears that China’s economy may be weaker than previously expected hit every sector of the markets. Financial and consumer discretionary stocks fell the most, particularly those with high exposure to Asia. Defensive sectors, such as utilities and telecommunication services, fared somewhat better. High-grade bonds were essentially flat amid concerns about rising U.S. interest rates. The dollar lost ground against the euro and the yen.

 MARKET COMMENTARY   |  May 2015 
 World Markets Review for April 2015   











Global stocks rose modestly amid a strong rally in the energy sector. Rising oil prices, surging M&A activity and central bank stimulus measures helped to support world stock prices despite a slowdown in U.S. economic growth during the first quarter. Emerging markets rallied as market observers pushed back the timing of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve to later in the year. Bond markets declined and the dollar lost ground against the euro, the pound and most other currencies.

Overview
Aetos Capital (“Aetos”) provides customized portfolio solutions to institutional investors.  Our investment professionals bring deep experience across a broad range of asset classes including hedge funds, public and private equity, credit and real estate.  As dedicated fiduciaries, we employ a disciplined approach to asset allocation, manager selection, and portfolio construction that emphasizes comprehensive risk management at every step.
At Aetos, we are committed to providing our clients with exceptional service that is highly customized to meet their long-term investment goals.  To this end, we remain a wholly independently-owned, SEC-registered investment advisor1 with offices in New York and California. Since inception, we have grown steadily and organically to become the multi-billion dollar firm we are today.
______________
1 SEC registration does not imply in any manner whatsoever that Aetos has been sponsored, recommended, or approved, or that its abilities or qualifications have in any respect been passed upon by the United States or any agency or any office thereof.


















Approach | Aetos Capital



















































Approach
Investment Process





Building portfolios that seek to preserve capital and maximize alpha
At Aetos, we take a differentiated approach to identifying the fundamental sources of alpha, driven by our understanding of the nature of market inefficiencies and the potential rewards for providing liquidity.  We leverage this understanding to construct portfolios that are designed to preserve capital and maximize alpha generation over a wide range of market environments.
Our approach is both long-term and tactical.  We make core allocations to our highest-conviction managers that we believe are best-equipped to navigate through market cycles.  At the same time, our research team identifies developments in financial and economic conditions that create near-term investment opportunities, allowing us to make adjustments to our clients’ portfolios in the context of their longer-term goals.

Core Principles

Advantage
Below are four key factors that we believe differentiate Aetos from our peers:
Fiduciary Perspective
Aetos’ Co-Founder Anne Casscells brings a unique perspective to investing, having previously served as Chief Investment Officer of Stanford Management Company.  Our senior investment professionals also average more than 20 years of hedge fund investing experience as fiduciaries, in addition to deep capital markets expertise across asset classes, securities, and investment strategies.
Knowledge Sharing/“Extension of Staff”
At Aetos, we pride ourselves on the high level of knowledge transfer with our clients’ investment staffs, whereby individuals have access to senior Aetos investment leadership.  In addition to portfolio details, we share economic and market insights across traditional and alternative strategies, as well as provide training and education on best practices across areas such as strategy allocation, investment and operational due diligence, and risk management.
Significant Investor in Hedge Funds and Other Alternative Investment Strategies
Aetos is large enough to access the most sought-after hedge funds, yet nimble enough to identify unique alpha sources and make investments of meaningful size.  Our size and industry stature often enable us to negotiate favorable terms on behalf of clients.
Customized Investment Solutions
Creating customized portfolios is in Aetos’ DNA, starting with our first portfolio in 2001.  Currently, approximately 80% of our current assets under management are in highly customized mandates, including multi-strategy and specialty portfolios structured according to our clients’ investment needs.
















History | Aetos Capital

Advantage





History
Aetos was founded in 2001 by Anne Casscells, formerly the Chief Investment Officer of the Stanford Management Company, and Michael Klein, formerly the President of Morgan Stanley’s institutional funds business. With decades of deep capital markets and related fiduciary experience, our founding partners and broader team bring together a unique and complementary set of talents and skills.
Aetos was founded on the premise of working with institutions to create best-in-class investment programs, complementing their internal resources. Our goal is to provide a solution for institutions to invest in a superior risk-adjusted way, as well as to serve as an extension of our clients’ staff, seeking to provide high-touch service and to serve as a trusted partner.
















Investment Process | Aetos Capital



















































Approach
Investment Process





Investment Process
Aetos implements a fundamentally-based investment process, coupled with a disciplined approach to strategy allocation, manager selection and portfolio monitoring. Risk management is incorporated throughout every step of our investment process, and is an integral component of manager evaluation and portfolio construction from start to finish.
Strategy Allocation

Analyze fundamental data and capital market trends to assess relative attractiveness of various investment strategies
Anticipate shifts in public policy (including fiscal and monetary policy) and determine potential impacts on investor portfolios

Combine qualitative and quantitative analysis of managers to assess competitive advantage and ability to generate alpha
Engage managers at multiple levels of seniority and responsibility (holistic team perspective)
Perform extensive diligence on managers’ operational, business and legal infrastructures
Employ proprietary and third-party reference check systems

Portfolio Construction

Construct diversified, high-conviction portfolios using “core/satellite/opportunistic” model, aiming to be relatively concentrated by manager and well-diversified by strategy
Tailor portfolio exposures specifically to client objectives
Utilize constrained mean-variance optimization techniques, stress tests and VaR analyses

Manager and Portfolio Monitoring

Perform detailed monthly reviews of manager performance, positions, and risk exposures based on quantitative data and regular conversations with managers

Strategies for Investing in Uncertain Markets
In an uncertain market, one thing is certain: Market declines are an inevitable part of investing.
These 5 investment strategies can help you ride out the bumps and keep your eyes on the big picture.












Stay Calm and Get Professional Advice

Avoid making quick moves on your own, as tempting as it may be. Instead, meet with your financial professional and share your concerns.
Resist making decisions on the basis of single events.
Re-examine your investment goals, time horizon and risk tolerance with your financial professional to make sure they remain appropriate.




 






Maintain a Diversified Investment Portfolio

Work with your financial professional to spread your risks.
Consider selecting a mix of mutual funds that invests in stocks and bonds. Additionally, keeping an appropriate amount of your portfolio in money market or cash equivalent mutual funds and other liquid investments can help you meet short-term needs. 
Include funds that invest outside the United States. Non-U.S. markets often move in their own market cycles.
Diversification doesn’t guarantee a profit, but over time it can help to reduce the effects of volatility.


Maintain a Diversified Investment Portfolio




 






Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times















Avoid moving everything into stocks at the hint of good news — or everything into cash following bad news.
Instead of fearing a down market, view it as an opportunity to buy shares at potentially lower prices.
Consider investing a fixed amount every month or quarter, a strategy known as dollar cost averaging. You won’t have to guess which way the market is going. You also won't risk the possibility of investing all of your money at the top of the market. (Please note that this strategy of regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss.)


Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times


Invest Regularly — In Good and Bad Times




 






Invest for Income

Consider mutual funds that stress the role of dividends — or bond funds that produce a steady stream of interest payments.
Income-producing investments can provide a cushion during a down stock market. After all, a dividend is yours whether the stock price is rising or falling. 


Invest for Income




 






Avoid Jumping In and Out of the Market

Successful market timing during a bear market is extremely difficult because it requires two near-perfect actions: getting out at the right time and getting back in at the right time. As a result, investors typically end up buying high and selling low.
One reason it’s difficult: A bear market is not usually characterized by a straight-line decline in stock prices. Instead, it tends to be jagged — showing bursts of stock price increases and then declines that bring with them corresponding feelings of euphoria and concern.

 Staying the Course 
 


















Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 


Regular investing does not ensure a profit or protect against loss. Investors should consider their willingness to keep investing when share prices are declining.

 World Markets Review for November 2015  











Global stocks produced mixed returns amid investor worries about sluggish economic growth and expectations for higher U.S. interest rates. European equities advanced on the promise of new monetary stimulus measures, however, U.S. stocks were flat and emerging markets retreated. Bonds also declined as Federal Reserve leaders indicated that a rate hike is likely in December. The dollar rose sharply against the euro and the yen.

Global stocks rallied as central bank stimulus and rising M&A activity helped offset ongoing concerns about a slowing world economy.

 MARKET COMMENTARY   |  September 2015 
 Fed Rate Decision: Near-Zero For Now, But Higher Soon?  












The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates close to zero, as concern about global economic conditions cast a shadow over an otherwise fairly bright outlook for the U.S. economy.
Looking forward, the Fed is expected to raise rates gradually, and an increase of 0.25%, for example, would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy.
Over time, higher interest rates can be beneficial for bond investors, enabling reinvestment in issues offering higher yields.
Rising rates have a varied impact on stocks. Selective investors who emphasize company-specific research should continue to find attractive longer term income and return opportunities.

 MARKET COMMENTARY   |  September 2015  |  FEATURING Timothy D. Armour & Robert W. Lovelace 
 Q&A With Portfolio Managers Tim Armour and Rob Lovelace  











Perspective on Recent Market Selloff Triggered by China Woes
Global stocks have tumbled in recent days amid investor concerns about slowing economic growth in China. A sharp decline in Chinese stocks and a surprise currency devaluation have further stoked fears that the outlook for China is deteriorating, and events there could hurt its global trading partners, including Japan, Europe and ultimately the United States. China lowered interest rates and eased reserve requirements on banks in an attempt to calm investors and stimulate the economy. Against this backdrop, portfolio managers Tim Armour and Rob Lovelace share their thoughts on the unfolding events:

China now accounts for roughly 15% of the world’s gross domestic product and therefore has a greater impact than ever before on the global economy.
The most significant catalyst of the selloff was China’s unexpected decision to devalue its currency, delivering a shock to financial markets.

Global stocks plummeted as fears that China’s economy may be weaker than previously expected hit every sector of the markets. Financial and consumer discretionary stocks fell the most, particularly those with high exposure to Asia. Defensive sectors, such as utilities and telecommunication services, fared somewhat better. High-grade bonds were essentially flat amid concerns about rising U.S. interest rates. The dollar lost ground against the euro and the yen.

Emerging markets stocks declined, weighed down by a sharp drop in Chinese shares and falling commodities prices. High-grade bonds gained from a flight-to-safety trade.

 MARKET COMMENTARY   |  July 2015

Global stocks produced mixed returns as signs of improving economic growth were offset by fears of rising interest rates and a worsening debt crisis in Greece. Telecommunications stocks proved to be a bright spot, driven higher by M&A activity, while the rate-sensitive utilities sector fell the most. Emerging markets stocks advanced, supported by monetary easing in China. Bonds declined and the dollar slipped 4% against the euro.

 World Markets Review for April 2015   











Global stocks rose modestly amid a strong rally in the energy sector. Rising oil prices, surging M&A activity and central bank stimulus measures helped to support world stock prices despite a slowdown in U.S. economic growth during the first quarter. Emerging markets rallied as market observers pushed back the timing of an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve to later in the year. Bond markets declined and the dollar lost ground against the euro, the pound and most other currencies.

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
