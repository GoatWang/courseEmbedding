What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

SCROLL DOWN





YOU've never had sushi like this before
 



 we want the freedom to eat when it suits us best.Our Maki hand rolls are inspired by the aesthetics and practicality of Japanese maki-zushi and temaki rolls. They are beautifully presented and incorporate simply prepared fresh ingredients, unique and deliberate combinations of flavors. But that's not the best part. Rolls are individually packaged to ensure each nori wrapper is kept separate and crisp until the moment they're ready to be eaten. Just peel, roll & eat! Goodbye, soggy seaweed. This is how a sushi hand roll should taste. OUR ingredientsOur food is packed with a wholesome blend of local, seasonal and nutritious ingredients. We procure fresh ingredients from responsible suppliers and local producers. We love organic and support sustainable business practices for fishing and farming methods.WE deliver locallyWith The following Services:               Caviar / Postmates / Uber Eats

                Ambar's owners have converted the former Boulevard Woodgrill space in Clarendon.

Maki Shop, the fast-casual sushi spot that made waves when it launched in Logan Circle in 2015, has raised $200,000 for a second location in Bethesda and hopes to raise more.
The restaurant, which comes from former Kushi owner Darren Norris, is hoping to raise a total of $900,000 for the restaurant, which will be located at the Georgetown Square Shopping Center at 10400 Old Georgetown Road, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                            Ambar's owners have converted the former Boulevard Woodgrill space in Clarendon.                        
Goran Kosanovic










 


Maki Shop announced on Facebook in August that it was working with Equity Eats on a new location in Bethesda. The SEC filing lists Josh Dworken, Mark Levin and Todd Ciuba as managers of Maki Shop Store 3 LLC. We’ve reached out for more on their plans and will update the story if we hear back.




Happy Tart: This gluten-free bakery in Alexandria’s Del Ray neighborhood is looking to serve people from more than just its signature hand cart. The store has applied to add a restaurant component to the bakery at 2307A Mount Vernon Avenue. The proposal would put 10 seats inside and 20 in the alley in front of the bakery, alongside the neighboring building. The current space does not have any seating. The Alexandria Planning Commission approved the proposal Oct. 4




 


Ambar: Balkan restaurant Ambar opened its second D.C.-area location Wednesday, this one in Clarendon. The restaurant, which has its first location on Capitol Hill’s Barracks Row, is located in the former Boulevard Woodgrill space at 2901 Wilson Blvd. The eastery from Serbian natives Ivan Iricanin and Uros Smiljanic features cuisine from the Mediterranean peninsula, wines from that region and a Rakia bar featuring the traditional fruit-based spirit. The restaurant will be open daily for lunch and dinner and for brunch on weekends.
Dirty Habit: The new restaurant in the Hotel Monaco in D.C. opened Saturday, bringing an “edgy” design and a menu of global small plates to the space at 555 Eighth St. NW. The food comes from Executive Chef Kyoo Eom — who also served as the chef of Dirty Habit’s predecessor, Poste — and the drinks from head bartender Sarah Ruiz. The restaurant is located in a glass-enclosed space in the building’s central courtyard that was expanded after Poste closed. The new structure has remote-controlled, retractable glass walls.

Rebecca Cooper covers retail, restaurants, tourism and the arts.

“Wonderful store, though hard to find!”


Reviewed July 10, 2016




I highly recommend this store if you are looking for quality products from Ecuador! If you can't find them, keep looking! I initially gave this store a poor review because I thought they were out of business. It was not at the location listed and the tourist info office across the street had never heard of them. But a couple of days later I unexpectedly found the store in a new location! They told me that they had been closed because of the recent move. I am so glad I found them because their merchandise is top notch and I feel good that the money is going to support the artisans themselves. Since that time I see that they have updated their address online.

“More than just a shop”


Reviewed January 10, 2016




Although it is one of the best shops for handmade products in the city, we were delighted by the actual work done behind scenes. They work with local producers on a fair trade basis, but more interestingly they are linked to a community tourism network. The way in which both sustain each other entrepreneurship was inspiring as they are showing economic alternatives for local people while rescuing their cultural heritage.

“Not worth the detour ”


Reviewed December 26, 2015



via mobile




Visited after reading the good trip advisor comments but the shop was a disappointment. Although the staff were friendly, the stock was limited and not really artisanal. A few Panama multi coloured hats but not many gift items. If passing then perhaps walk in however the shop is not worth a detour.

“A NICE LITTLE SHOP FOR HAND MADE”


Reviewed December 14, 2015




I believe that all their merchandise is ECUADORIAN hand made.They have clothing and jewelry. And the prices are in line with other similar shops.

Arthur HSaint Louis, Missouri388103Reviewed July 31, 2016 If you are looking for a unique (and usable) souvenir, go to Maki Fair TradeMaki Fair Trade has unique and beautiful products. Alpaca garments, shawls that look nothing like those available in the States, woven baskets with napkin rings fitted inside, hats expertly made and in bright or muted colors. Also, just outside Maki, you have a great view...MoreThank Arthur H Eric Francisco O, Gerente at MAKI FairTrade, responded to this reviewResponded August 2, 2016Dear Arhtur, thanks for your visit and your support to fairtrade and our artisans. We hope to see you soon. Hugs, Eric.



Ann MDetroit, Michigan1814Reviewed July 10, 2016 Wonderful store, though hard to find!I highly recommend this store if you are looking for quality products from Ecuador! If you can't find them, keep looking! I initially gave this store a poor review because I thought they were out of business. It was not at the location listed and...MoreThank Ann M Eric Francisco O, Gerente at MAKI FairTrade, responded to this reviewResponded July 11, 2016Dear Ann we are very sorry that you can't find us but we are happy to see you again and grateful for your comments and your support to fair trade.

topicsterLondon, United Kingdom21Reviewed January 10, 2016 More than just a shopAlthough it is one of the best shops for handmade products in the city, we were delighted by the actual work done behind scenes. They work with local producers on a fair trade basis, but more interestingly they are linked to a community tourism network....More1  Thank topicster MarcelaOrellanaCalle, Director de Relaciones Públicas at MAKI FairTrade, responded to this reviewResponded February 2, 2016Thanks for visiting us and recommend our store, all our artisans are grateful for people like you who support fair trade. we hope you come back soon.



LondonPilotLondon212112Reviewed December 26, 2015 via mobile Not worth the detour Visited after reading the good trip advisor comments but the shop was a disappointment.
Although the staff were friendly, the stock was limited and not really artisanal. A few Panama multi coloured hats but not many gift items.
If passing then perhaps walk in however...More1  Thank LondonPilot MarcelaOrellanaCalle, Director de Relaciones Públicas at MAKI FairTrade, responded to this reviewResponded December 28, 2015We are very sorry that your visit did not meet your expectations.
Indeed our stock was affected by the reception of visitors during the holiday season . We appreciate your candor because it allows us to improve. We hope your next visit be more enjoyable....More



johnfooteCuenca, Ecuador9335Reviewed December 14, 2015 A NICE LITTLE SHOP FOR HAND MADEI believe that all their merchandise is ECUADORIAN hand made.
They have clothing and jewelry. And the prices are in line with other similar shops.3  Thank johnfoote MazhyxOrellana, Director de Relaciones Públicas at MAKI FairTrade, responded to this reviewResponded December 18, 2015Thanks for visiting us and supporting fair trade.

Use decor to complement home and office furnishings. Choose blinds and curtains in colors that accentuate existing furniture and art that matches the style of the room you're decorating. Place clocks and decorative thermometers on your walls for visual appeal that ties your space together.

Stylish Accent Pieces
Decor such as accent and coffee tables adds a finishing touch to your room while providing an extra level of functionality. Use end tables from OSP Designs and Simpli Home beside couches and chairs to give guests a place for drinks and refreshments. Select coffee tables from Modway and International Concepts to display reading material in waiting areas. Use these accent pieces to display other decor such as decorative baskets, bowls, and boxes.

Protect Flooring
Floor decor not only provides a simple way to tie the style and theme of your room together, it also protects your flooring. Choose rugs from Safavieh and nuLOOM to coordinate with all types of furniture. Select chair mats from Staples and Floortex to ensure office chairs don't damage the flooring you choose to match your office space. Stair treads allow you to add a decorative touch to steps in your home or office while offering extra protection against accidents.

Artistic Touches
Use wall decor such as art and photography to capture the interest of visitors to your home or office. Abstract and modern art adds a sophisticated vibe to your space, while motivational art works well in employee areas to ensure morale stays high. Vintage art brings a nostalgic ambiance to any room and compliments retro furniture choices.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

The Express Gold LLC formation package includes everything from the Standard package with a 7-10 business day turnaround, plus a Federal Tax ID (EIN) (discounted and expedited), a tax consultation with 1-800Accountant, and a 30-day trial of attorney advice.

D.C. Cheap Eats 2015: 20 New Dishes Under $10, Mapped
The best new options in affordable cuisine in the D.C. area.

  
    by

    
Eater Staff

When it comes to D.C. area cheap eats, many people can name the standards: a bowl at Pho 75, a banh mi from D.C. sandwich, some pupusas from...anywhere. But are D.C.'s hottest and newest restaurants delivering when it comes to affordable cuisine.
Here are 20 new affordable eats worth checking out in a variety of neighborhoods around town, all priced under $10. Give each of them a try when it's not a good day to spend half a paycheck. Another idea: visit new locations of existing restaurants for further affordable options, including Bonchon (now in Navy Yard), the Rosslyn Wiseguys and the Atlas District Ben's Chili Bowl.

Go Fish — Find Super-Trendy Poke at These Places in D.C.
 Pokémon is everywhere--and so is the Hawaiian dish of a similar name

Poke at Conosci
Official




What began as a Hawaiian fishermen's snack is now spreading across the D.C. area. Poke, the raw fish dish, can be found everywhere from multiple interpretations at Arlington Hawaiian restaurant Hula Girl to hand roll and bowl versions at downtown's Maki Shop. Pop-up and truck operation Abunai even offers poke made with tofu instead of tuna (D.C. saw another poke pop-up, Poke Pop D.C., in May at Prequel, too). There's also a new Northern Virginia Poké-Man food truck that couldn't have started rolling at a better time with the Pokémon craze in full effect.
The team behind Chasin' Tails also plans to do a vegetarian version in addition to traditional fish when poke goes fast-casual at Lei'd later this year. California's Honeyfish Poke also is looking to expand here.
It's said that poke was first made when fishermen in Hawaiian began mixing throw-away scraps of fish with seasonings to have as a snack. Although poke can be made with raw octopus, salmon, or even shellfish, it's usually associated with tuna now.
Today seasonings and toppings typically have a Japanese bent. Soy sauce, green onions, sesame seeds, furikake, and wasabi are common, but some D.C restaurants are getting experimental and making it with preserved lime, Macadamia nut, or toasted coconut.
— Updated by Tierney Plumb and Missy Frederick







1 Abunai

This roving food truck does a vegetarian poke with fried tofu, watercress, carrots, onions, tomato, soy ginger dressing, and rice. It's served with a side of furikake mac salad. Check their social media accounts for locations.
