Farkas founded Island Capital Group LLC in May 2003 and is its Managing Member, Chairman and CEO.  Mr. Farkas was previously Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Insignia Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE: IFS), a global real estate services company that he founded in 1990 and was merged with CB Richard Ellis in July 2003 to form the world's largest commercial real estate services company. In its heyday, Insignia was the largest owner and operator of multifamily residential housing and among the largest owners and operators of commercial space in the United States, owning, controlling or managing approximately 350,000 apartments and over 200 million square feet of commercial space. The portfolio had a gross capitalization in excess of $10 billion.
Immediately subsequent to Mr. Farkas’ merging of Insignia with CBRE in 2003, he founded Island Capital Group, a real estate merchant banking firm specializing in real estate investing, real estate operating businesses and real estate securities.  Island presently owns controlling interests in a number of businesses which manage, in the aggregate, in excess of $180 billion of assets.  Among these are C-III Capital Partners, one of the largest CMBS investors and Special Servicers in the US., and Island Global Yachting, the leading owner and operator of yachting oriented resorts in the western hemisphere.
Mr. Farkas is an avid philanthropist, sailor and cook.  He is a supporter of and involved in The Fresh Air Fund, Playwrights of New York (PONY), The Arthur Miller Foundation, NARAL, the ASPCA, AMFAR, The Doe Fund, The Young Women’s Leadership Network, Trinity School, Harvard University and various other health, education and welfare oriented charities.  He serves as Graduate Chairman of the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 (www.hastypudding.org). The Hasty Pudding Institute resides at Farkas Hall, one of the primary performing arts centers at Harvard University, so named in connection with a major gift given to the University by Mr. Farkas.

Mr. Farkas received a B.A. degree from Harvard University in 1982, where he majored in economics.

Farkas Subsidiary Implementing New Technology


				May 19			


In today’s real estate market, having a competitive edge is imperative. NAI Tampa, a member of the NAI Global network, has partnered with the marketing firm Buildout to help make their business dealings more effective.
Buildout created new online resources and apps for NAI. The new services allow NAI to automatically create and deliver documents upon request to a client. Since NAI has clients all across the globe, this helps with different time zones.
Along with website and digital upgrades, brokers are now implementing drones into their usual tools. The video captured by drones allows clients to see exactly how the property looks and what the surrounding area is like. They also allow for tours of a property.
While a drone tour is exciting, sometimes a client wants to feel like they are actually in the building. Another tool that commercial real estate agencies are now utilizing is virtual reality (VR). Firms are now beginning to use VR goggles to show clients what the property looks like and what it could look like if it were furnished. The possibilities are endless.
NAI Tampa still believes that classic methods such as email blasts and direct phone calls are the most effective. With so many new possibilities, it is no wonder that even firms with tried and true methods like NAI are making strives into new technology based ones.
As a subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners, NAI Global has been widely successful. With a variety of clients, NAI and C-III Capital Partners have been able to work together to bring their services to clients around the world.







Farkas Subsidiary Promotes VP to COO


				May 01			


Earlier this year, NAI Hiffman, a member of NAI Global, announced that it would be promoting Michael Flynn from Vice President to Chief Operating Officer. This is part of NAI Hiffman’s plan to expand their current operations.
Flynn has been in the commercial real estate business for over 30 years. His experiences in the industry combined with his leadership skills have made him the perfect candidate for this position. He was also one of the original team members that helped launch NAI Hiffman in 2000. Since then, he has continued to climb into various leadership roles while also helping to expand NAI Hiffman.
With this new position, Flynn will also continue to serve on the NAI Global Member Leadership Board.
NAI Hiffman specializes in commercial real estate in the greater Chicago area. This branch of NAI is responsible for some of the largest leasing deals in Chicago. Since 2000, many of NAI Hiffman’s brokers have been recognized for being amongst the top producers in NAI Global’s annual recognition program.
The NAI Global network of real estate brokers spans across the world with over 6,700 members in over 400 offices. Each of these members, like Michael Flynn, are experts in their respective commercial real estate markets. In total, NAI Global manages over 380 million square feet of property.
Andrew Farkas’ subsidiary, C-III Capital Partners, acquired NAI Global in 2011. His company, Island Capital Group, has strived to diversify their portfolio and make themselves known as real estate industry leaders. Since getting his start in commercial real estate, Farkas has been known for his successful achievements as well as his company’s diverse portfolio.







Farkas Subsidiary Nationally Ranked


				Apr 10			


U.S. Residential Group, a subsidiary of C-III Capital Partners, has been ranked one of the top 50 managers of 2017.
Earlier this week, the National Multifamily Housing Council released its 2017 rankings in a variety of categories. These include top owners, general contractors, developers and syndicators. These rankings help to determine the major players in the real estate business, specifically, those properties that house multiple families.
U.S. Residential Group this year rose to the number 30 spot on the top 50 managers list. This year, they managed 42,928 units of housing. This is an increase of over 2,000 unites since the 2016 rankings.
As a full-service multi-housing community management company, U.S. Residential Group manages over 200 properties across the United States. In 2016, C-III acquired Resource America. Earlier this year, U.S. Residential combined its operations with Resource America. This combination and the move into C-III allowed all three companies to diversify their portfolios of properties across the country.
C-III Capital Partners is known for its track record of creating value in a diverse range of markets. Their services include primary and secondary loan servicing, loan origination, fund management, and principal investment. They provide services to over $60 billion worth of commercial real estate.
C-III is a controlled affiliate of Island Capital Group. The firm is located in New York City and was founded by Andrew Farkas in 2003. As the founder and CEO of Island Capital Group, Farkas has had a long track record of successful achievements in real estate. His company’s acquisition of C-III Capital Partners has allowed the two companies to grow exponentially and become leaders in the world of real estate.







Farkas Subsidiary Member Reports Rise in SC Office Market


				Mar 31			


This quarter, NAI Avant broker Scott Peevy reported shifts in the office space market in Charleston, South Carolina. He reports that rates for office space rentals in the popular Southern city began to level off at the end of 2016 but that investment opportunities are very attractive right now.
Current trends show a great deal of redevelopment projects beginning in areas that are in great need of it. This is of great importance seeing as Charleston is known for having a large shortage on office space. This causes high rent rates with lower vacancy numbers. These numbers and the shortages show that the market for new office spaces is extremely attractive right now.
According to the NAI broker, investors are currently working to obtain better returns on office spaces thanks to the projections that occupancy rates will rise along with rental rates. Investors are seriously considering making major improvements to second-tier office spaces as they hold the highest vacancy percentages (10.5%) in Charleston. Along with this, demand for newly renovated spaces is showing a major rise.
Peevy also reports that there is a major surge in retail projects in the city. Which is particularly healthy for the market as it allows for more diversity in businesses in the area.
Scott Peevy is a broker for NAI Avant, a member of the NAI Global Network of real estate brokers and experts. The major network has over 400 offices located around the world with more than 7,000 real estate experts. Their portfolio features over 425 million square feet of property internationally.
NAI Global is a subsidiary of Andrew Farkas’ Island Capital Group. The company is the parent company of C-III Capital Partners. C-III acquired NAI Global in 2016. This acquisition of NAI allowed C-III to diversify their portfolio while also helping both firms to remain leaders in the market.







Farkas’ Real Estate Network Ranked Top 4 Globally


				Mar 17			


This month, the Lipsey Company released their Top 25 Commercial Real Estate Brands list. For the second year in a row, NAI Global was voted into the number four spot.
The Lipsey Company’s survey has been the industry standard for the past 16 years. They have set the hierarchy for the top real estate brands in the world. Over 100,000 real estate industry professionals from around the world were tasked with completing the survey.

Grand Sphinx Farkas to Honor Barclay at Gala


				Feb 24			


Harvard University’s Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 and Grand Sphinx, Andrew Farkas, will be honoring Paris Barclay as the 2017 recipient of the Order of the Golden Sphinx award at the annual Order of the Golden Sphinx Gala in New York City on April 3rd.
Established in 1770, the Hasty Pudding Institute is the oldest collegiate social club in the nation. The club is a premiere preforming arts organization that strives to unite Harvard undergraduate students in friendship, conversation and camaraderie. Since its creation, Hasty Pudding has grown significantly and now is made up of The Hasty Pudding Club, Hasty Pudding Theatricals and Harvard Krokodiloes.
Each year the Hasty Pudding Institute recognizes one individual in the entertainment industry for their contributions to the performing arts. Each recognized individual is bestowed the club’s highest honor, the Order of the Golden Sphinx award, and is celebrated at the annual Order of the Golden Sphinx Gala.
Certainly a well-deserving recipient of this award, Paris Barclay is an Emmy award-winning director and currently serves as the President of the Directors Guild of America. Graduating Harvard in 1979, Barclay was a member of the Hasty Pudding club as an undergrad and participated in the club as a former singer of the Krokodiloes and composer two Hasty Pudding Theatricals shows.
As the 2017 recipient of the Order of the Golden Sphinx award, Barclay joins a prestigious club filled with extraordinarily talented members like Clive Davis, legendary music producer; Daryl Roth, Tony Award-winning Broadway producer; David Heyman, box office-hit producer, and many more.
This year’s honoree celebration will be held at the Paramount Hotel in New York City and attendees will have an opportunity to enjoy performances by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and Harvard Krokodiloes. Chairman and Grand Sphinx of the Hasty Pudding Institute, Andrew Farkas, will also be in attendance and recently noted his excitement for this year’s nominee.
As an active alumni and former president of the Hasty Pudding Institute, Andrew Farkas not only serves as the Chairman but also “Grand Sphinx” of the club. In 2011, thanks to a generous donation from Farkas, the Hasty Pudding club was able to make improvements to the theatre in which they perform all shows. The gift marked the renaming of the theater to Farkas Hall, which serves as a presentation the Farkas family’s commitment maintain the club’s facilities.

Sitting Down with Andrew L. Farkas '82


He is the kind of man whose calendar is always full. Prominent among these commitments is this evening’s Hasty Pudding Man of the Year event, when he will be recognized as the theater’s new namesake.


        By Reina A.E. Gattuso
Feb 9, 2012




“I bleed Crimson,” pronounces Andrew L. Farkas ’82, sitting at the light wooden bar at Henrietta’sTable, the posh restaurant attached to theCharles Hotel. Indeed, the former president of the Hasty Pudding Club has made his love for his alma mater quite public. Due to his recent donation, New College Theater now bears the name Farkas Hall.
It’s winter, but Farkas is tan. He has an air of monied efficiency: a clipped, genial tone and a sense of unadulterated self-assurance. He is the kind of short man, he boasts, who is not intimidatedby tall women. “My wife,” he says. “is 6’3”in heels.” He is the kind of man whose calendar is always full. Prominent among these commitments is this evening’s Hasty Pudding Man of the Year event, when he will be recognized as the theater’s new namesake.
Farkas is familiar with the Hasty Pudding Club—as an undergraduate he was its president for two years. He says that it was his fondness for the Club, and the Theatricals which call 12 Holyoke Street home, that inspired the gift.
Since his Harvard days, Farkas has founded Island Capital, a hugely successful real estate firm. More relevant to tonight’s festivities, however, is abusiness enterprise he was involved with while at Harvard. “When I was undergraduate president, the Pudding was in a tremendous amount of trouble,” Farkas says. “It was basically broke.” So Farkas did something that he admits has since become a major component of his lifestyle, if not of his business model: he threw a party.
“I got the Copley Plaza Hotel to give me 900 bottles of champagne for a very, very cheap price,”he recounts. “Then I sold tickets, basically door-to-door, for a gala in honor of the Hasty Pudding.” The party grossed about $35,000, covering the Club’s operating budget for that year.
Farkas rhapsodizes about the Pudding, recounting strings of facts about the organization: “It’s been around since 1770....It’s the oldest college social club in the United States by far. Five presidents of the United States were members. The Hasty Pudding Theatricals is the third-oldest theatrical organization in the world.”
The Pudding is not the only club at Harvard to which Farkas has kept ties after graduating. He was in the A.D. Club as an undergraduate, and he is rumored to have flown all of the Final club’s members to Las Vegas.
“I will not comment on anything that goes on in the A.D. Club,” Farkas responds to the rumor, in a voice that suggests that he is accustomed to talking to reporters about things he will not comment on.
Farkas will, however, confirm the rumors currently circulating that he wanted to name the theater “The Farkatorium.” “The Farkatorium sounds to me like Thunderdome,” he says with a smile—though the University, apparently, was slightly less amused.
But it’s not the first time the Farkas name has been a source of tension. The family has long been linked to Harvard—Farkas’ father, brother, daughter, nephews, and cousins all attended the school. But Farkas says with playful matter-of-factness that he was “brutally, relentlessly, ruthlessly” mocked for his unconventional surname. “It probably formed who I am today, having to overcomethat torment,” he says.
When asked for advice he pauses for a moment, then offers: “Harvard is just the greatest place on earth.” It’s the kind of phrase that would qualify as “gushing” if he weren’t so composed. “It really is,” he affirms, his voice building. “If you’re fortunate enough to be here, it’s really important that you pause and remind yourself of that.”
Maybe that’s easy to say when your name graces a building—but there’s something about the man’s conviction that could persuade the rest of us too.
Though Farkas himself never participated in the Hasty Pudding’s most famed ritual, he has no qualms about attending his dedication in whatever dress is necessary. “If I have to do it while wearing panties and a bra, I’ll do it.”

Perhaps no man would become more important to Andrew M. Cuomo’s political and personal finances than the real estate magnate Andrew L. Farkas.But in 1997 the two men were sworn enemies.Mr. Cuomo, then the nation’s housing secretary, was pursuing a case in which Mr. Farkas’s company had paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to a landlord. Mr. Farkas believed that his company, Insignia Financial Group, was being unfairly singled out for what had been a widespread and accepted industry practice.Eventually, Mr. Cuomo settled the case, clearing the way for  Insignia  to complete the sale of its apartment business for $910 million in 1998. And three years later, he began a friendship with Mr. Farkas, astonishing Insignia’s workers who had lived through the battle.That relationship proved hugely beneficial to both men.Mr. Cuomo received hundreds of thousands of dollars for his campaigns, and, in a three-year stretch between political races, a job working for Mr. Farkas that paid him more than $2.5 million.

Now, as Mr. Cuomo runs for governor on a pledge to clean up Albany, the relationship is drawing renewed fire.Mr. Cuomo’s Republican opponent, Carl P. Paladino, suggests Mr. Farkas essentially repaid Mr. Cuomo  for going easy on his company in the case with the Department of Housing and Urban Development.“Here’s a man who stole millions of dollars, and Andrew gives him a pass,”  Mr. Paladino said on a radio show this week.Mr. Cuomo brushes off the charge, saying the idea that he, HUD officials and the Justice Department conspired to give Mr. Farkas a pass  in exchange for personal rewards for Mr. Cuomo much later is preposterous. And there is little evidence to support it.But the subject remains delicate enough that Mr. Cuomo declined repeated requests to be interviewed about it, and his unabashed reliance on Mr. Farkas stands out in a time in which Mr. Cuomo scrupulously seeks to avoid even the appearance of controversy.Mr. Farkas, in a telephone interview, said that befriending Mr. Cuomo back in 2001 required overcoming his own deep suspicion and anger. And he said he had taken  a big role in Mr. Cuomo’s career knowing full well how it might look.“The truth is, there’s a friendship here, a love and a respect here, and a bond, that surmounts all of this stuff,” Mr. Farkas said. “Because there is nothing about all of this noise that is remotely inappropriate or improper.”

Mr. Farkas likened their 2001 détente to the wary peacemaking of two old warriors.But in 1997, he and Mr. Cuomo were more like crown princes of the housing world. Mr. Farkas, the heir to the Alexander’s department store fortune, had spent years amassing apartment portfolios, building Insignia into the nation’s largest owner and manager of multifamily property. Mr. Cuomo had just taken over at HUD, with promises to clean up fraud and waste.In a  campaign with the Justice Department, Mr. Cuomo authorized a  lawsuit against A. Bruce Rozet, a notorious HUD landlord, accusing him of taking kickbacks from the management company he had hired to run his buildings. Insignia had taken over that management company, and continued the arrangement, turning over one-third of its HUD fees to Mr. Rozet.Insignia was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, but the allegation that it had broken the law by splitting its fees inflamed Mr. Farkas and threatened his company. “The finger was being pointed directly at Farkas, and the charge was led by Cuomo,” said a former Insignia executive. “It couldn’t have gotten more personal.”

Insignia settled in 1998, paying a total of $7.4 million — the government had alleged $7.6 million in kickbacks — and providing evidence against Mr. Rozet. The former executive said Insignia feared that the government could otherwise bar  it from handling HUD properties, a crippling blow.A prosecutor in the case, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Insignia had received no special treatment; rather, HUD and the Justice Department were less aggressive with Insignia than with Mr. Rozet because Insignia had inherited the fee-splitting arrangement and because of a lack of  evidence that it had intended to break the law.But Mr. Farkas was deeply embittered toward Mr. Cuomo.It was not until the summer of 2001 that the two men actually met; Mr. Farkas happened to be in the office of a friend when Mr. Cuomo arrived to talk about his run for governor.

As Mr. Farkas sat there, seething, he recalled, Mr. Cuomo realized who he was and asked for a meeting.“I figured I’d never see or hear from the man again,” Mr. Farkas said. But when he returned to his office, he found a message from Mr. Cuomo.The two had a long, intense conversation. Mr. Farkas complained that HUD had mistreated his company and that the case was “terribly disruptive” and meritless. Mr. Cuomo asked to put their past differences behind them, but Mr. Farkas insisted that he also talk  with Insignia’s managers and directors. Again, Mr. Cuomo surprised him by doing so, earning “mixed reviews,” Mr. Farkas said.

But Mr. Farkas was impressed, and increasingly, enamored of Mr. Cuomo. He was still new to politics, and was “a little scared of it,” but he began helping Mr. Cuomo with fund-raising. Then Mr. Cuomo’s father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo,  asked him to serve as Andrew’s finance chairman.Mr. Farkas said it was he who broached their adversarial past, asking: “What are people going to say? People love to make allegations about things. Are you concerned?’ And they said, ‘No, we’ve thought about it; we’re not concerned.’ ”The turnabout staggered workers at Insignia, who bridled at requests to contribute to Mr. Cuomo. Said one executive: “In the beginning a lot of us on the inside had a hard time taking that relationship seriously.”Mr. Cuomo’s run for governor in 2002 failed, and the next year, he found himself in the midst of a difficult divorce. Mr. Farkas, having made another fortune amassing and selling Insignia’s commercial real estate business, was building up a new venture, Island Capital, and offered Mr. Cuomo a job.Mr. Cuomo’s title was vice president. He helped in both big-picture and small-bore ways, offering political advice, mediating disputes and counseling Mr. Farkas on dealing with foreign governments.In one case, Mr. Cuomo got Mr. Farkas to listen to opponents of a luxury marina planned for the Virgin Islands, which would have restricted access to the bay for public-housing tenants who lived across the street. And he helped broker a deal in which Mr. Farkas sold the West Village Houses, a subsidized complex in Manhattan, to the tenants. Mr. Farkas said Mr. Cuomo persuaded him to accept a lower price than he could have exacted to avoid a public battle that “would not be good for the man I wanted to be.”Mr. Cuomo did not treat his job as a sinecure; colleagues and adversaries called him diligent and astute. But by 2005, eyeing a run for attorney general, he began spending more time preparing for that campaign, associates said.In May 2006, a wealthier Mr. Cuomo left Island Capital to campaign full time. Mr. Farkas said he agreed to serve as Mr. Cuomo’s finance chairman again, but reminded Mr. Cuomo to expect more attacks over their adversarial past.

“Are we O.K. with that?” Mr. Farkas said he asked.“We’re fine with it,” he said Mr. Cuomo told him.Mr. Farkas said he understood why their relationship was  viewed with suspicion. But he insisted his motives were pure, saying he was not seeking any personal gain.“I need this kind of thing like I need a hole in my head,” he said. “There’s nothing in this for me. I do this purely out of love for the man, and because the future of this state is important to my family.”

Andrew L. Farkas ’82 and Sandi Goff Farkas

March 30, 2012






As an undergraduate, Andrew L. Farkas ’82 spent some of his most memorable times with Harvard’s Hasty Pudding Club, the social organization long tied to Harvard’s creative life. So when the opportunity arose to celebrate the stunning performing arts space for students that now fills the club’s original 1888 home, and to showcase Hasty Pudding history in its lobby, he seized it.
His gift, which named the building Farkas Hall, is a threefold gesture of appreciation for Harvard College, the Hasty Pudding, and his father, Robin L. Farkas ’54, MBA ’61.
Through a major renovation and expansion, Harvard transformed the deteriorated 1888 structure at 12 Holyoke St. into a vibrant performance, rehearsal, and learning space for Harvard undergraduates. The six-story complex, under construction from 2005 to 2007, retained its original façade and entryway but now houses a handsome 270-seat theater with state-of-the-art lighting and sound systems, a moveable stage, and other modern amenities, along with a dance studio, classrooms, and offices for arts-related student groups. It was dubbed the New College Theatre until being renamed in October 2011.
Thanks to Farkas and his wife, Sandi, the brick building—long occupied by the Hasty Pudding Club and Hasty Pudding Theatricals—also showcases the organizations’ pivotal role at Harvard through posters, photographs, and plaques displayed in the elegant Hasty Pudding Lobby. The space has been both refreshed but preserved, “and that is wonderful,” says Andrew, who served as club president for two years and is now a real estate investor in New York. “This is the Hasty Pudding’s historic home.”
"Harvard gave me a canvas on which to reinvent myself. I loved every second of it.”

Farkas Hall honors Robin Farkas, who raised Andrew and his brother, Bradford L. Farkas ’84, MBA ’90, on his own for many years. “He has been my father, my mentor, my best friend, and my role model, and he talked me into choosing Harvard,” Andrew explains. “My Harvard experience completely informed who I became. I arrived as an awkward, insecure fellow with great ambition but modest direction. Harvard gave me a canvas on which to reinvent myself. I loved every second of it.”
His academic highlight was writing an economics thesis for (the late) Otto Eckstein, Warburg Professor of Economics. Outside class, the Adams House resident found his niche in the A.D. final club and Hasty Pudding Club, which began in the late 1700s and required members to bring pots of grain pudding to meetings. Five U.S. presidents, from John Adams to John F. Kennedy, belonged. The country’s oldest collegiate social club, now based on Garden Street, spawned the Hasty Pudding Theatricals and its famously outrageous all-male revues, as well as the Harvard Krokodiloes and Radcliffe Pitches a cappella groups, which have offices in Farkas Hall. 
Today, Farkas, a father of three who is coleading his 30th Reunion Class Gift Committee, is chairman and CEO of Island Capital Group, a real estate-oriented private equity firm. Sandi is a playwright, screenwriter, and founder of Playwrights of New York, which supports emerging playwrights with fellowships.
Several generations of Farkases attended a dedication in February, among them Arielle Farkas ’13, also a Hasty Pudding member. It was a reminder of how the family’s legacy is now written into the narrative of this irreplaceable building and performance space, Farkas Hall.
