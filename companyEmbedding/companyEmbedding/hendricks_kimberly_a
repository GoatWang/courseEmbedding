Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices. A board-certified doctor is more likely than a non-board-certified doctor to have the most current skills and knowledge about how to treat your medical condition.50Conditions TreatedAdhesive CapsulitisAnkylosing SpondylitisArthritisAutoimmune DiseasesBone DisordersBursitisChronic Neck PainDegenerative Disc DiseaseDermatomyositisDupuytren's ContractureEnthesopathy of Hip (incl.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0 SanctionsWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?No sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.Background CheckWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0 Board ActionsWhat are board actions?No board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.Background CheckWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.EducationPIKEVILLE COLL          SCH OF OSTEO MEDMedical School | Graduated 2004Awards & RecognitionWhat is a recognized doctor?Awards & HonorsDr. Hendricks has no awards or honors listed.Media & PublicationsDr. Hendricks has no media or publications listed.Awards & RecognitionWhat is a recognized doctor?Healthgrades Recognized Doctor designation identifies leading doctors who:Are board certified.Have not had their license surrendered or revoked since Healthgrades started collecting data in 2000.Have no malpractice judgments, adverse arbitration awards, or monetary settlements for the last five years in the states in which Healthgrades can collect malpractice data.Are free of state or federal disciplinary actions (sanctions) for the last five years.Healthgrades updates the Recognized Doctor list quarterly based on board certification data. Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Languages SpokenEnglishMemberships & Professional AffiliationsDr. Hendricks does not have any memberships or affiliations listed.

She honestly cares about you.  15-Tiffany in Dayton, OH | Sep 20, 2016This was the worst doctor visit ever! It only took 3 weeks to even get ahold of them to schedule because the front desk help is lazy and doesn't answer the phone. Then when I finally did get there, the front desk personnel was having a conversation with another employee and didn't even acknowledge that I was standing right in front of them! It has been 5 days since they said they called in my script for lupus but they didn't. They've had my test results for 2 business days and haven't called.55Waynesville, OH | Sep 13, 2016Fabulous care of her patients.  She has always done more than any other Dr. in the care of our daughter  who was a juvenile when she began with Dr. Hendricks.   55-LML in Dayton, OH | Aug 26, 2016Dr. Hendricks is the 3rd Rheumatologist I've seen and actually liked. She is prompt, considerate of my time and opinions,  and I've never felt rushed. She is open to any questions or input from me. Much appreciated and refreshing!15-Autumn Hawkins in Dayton, ohio | Aug 25, 2016I'm very unsatisfed with the care that Dr.Hendricks has provided me, small things such as recommending me to a pain specialist, not helping when I really needed help with forms needing to filled out.  All she cares about is putting you on Chemo medication that don't work and giving steroids!  Just terrible and heartless.  I have Lupus & Fibromyalgia. 15Jun 12, 2016Very reactive, does nothing unless patient suggests it. Not very knowledgeable of autoimmune arthritis. Does not return patients' phone calls, the nurses told me that only they could relay messages to her, and then they would never call me back. 55-Rhonda in Kettering | May 17, 2016Dr. Hendricks is absolutely the best! She takes her time and truly cares about her patients! She has empathy and her staff is the best!!!!!! I'm blessed to have her. 25Huber Heights | Mar 26, 2016Dr Hendrix is very brief and has little empathy for the disability that comes along with these kinds of illnesses. Her staff is horrible they don't care and they do the bare mminimum. They just want to get you out of the office.55-Angela in Dayton, OH | Feb 17, 2016I have never had a bad experience with Dr.Hendricks or her staff. She is always on time and very informative. I would recommend anyone needing treatment of a autoimmune disease to come to her!More CommentsHave you seen Dr. Kimberly Hendricks, DO?Leave a Review.Are you Dr. Hendricks?Make it easy for patients to share their feedback.
