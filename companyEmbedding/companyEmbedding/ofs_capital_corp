				OFS Capital Corporation - Initiation Note



OFS Capital Corp.
BUY (OFS, $10.75)
Low Leverage, Strong Growth Potential, and Sound Asset Quality - Initiating With A BUY Rating And $14 Price Target.
August 31, 2015

Investment Conclusion. We are initiating coverage of OFS Capital Ltd. (OFS) with a BUY rating and $14 price target. OFS Capital should be able to post strong NII/share (net investment income per share) growth through 2016 and increase its regular dividend, as we see it. OFS’s debt was entirely SBA (Small Business Administration) debentures as of 2Q15, putting regulatory leverage at zero. Thus despite the stock being at a substantial discount to NAV, the company has no need to issue equity to grow the portfolio significantly. A second SBIC (Small Business Investment Company) license has been applied for and would permit OFS to issue $75 million more in debentures not counted as regulatory leverage. The company has been rotating out of lower yielding club loans into more direct originations which have caused NIM (net investment margin) and effective yields to increase since 2013. While the dollar amount of club deals is relatively smaller at $28 million, OFS should be able to continue to improve effective yield going forward. Returns on equity (ROE) should also steadily improve as the company takes on more balance sheet leverage to grow the portfolio. OFS has solid asset quality with one small investment on non-accrual status as of 6/30/15, representing 1.6% of the portfolio at cost. Despite the sound asset quality and above average growth potential, OFS trades at 6.8x our $1.54 adjusted NII estimate for 2016 and at a 27% discount to NAV (net asset value). Our $14 price target implies an estimated 2016 P/ NII of 9.1x, dividend yield of 9.7%, and P/NAV of 0.94x compared to the BDC sector averages of 8.7x, 11.3%, and 0.88x, respectively.

*Adjusted net investment income = net investment income + write-off of deferred financing closing costs + incentive fee expenses associated with write-off

Five-star stocks sell for the biggest risk-adjusted discount whereas one-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic value. Based on a fundamentally focused methodology and a robust, standardized set of procedures and core valuation tools used by Morningstar's Equity Analysts, four key components drive the Morningstar Rating: 1. Assessment of the firm's economic moat, 2. Estimate of the stock's fair value, 3. Uncertainty around that fair value estimate and 4. Current market price.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
