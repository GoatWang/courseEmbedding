Background and history[edit]
1970s[edit]
The company that became Armor All was started in 1972 by entrepreneur and marketer Alan Rypinski.[1] In 1979, Rypinski sold all of the rights to the Armor All brand name and protectant to the San Francisco-based consumer products company McKesson Corporation.[1]
1980s[edit]
By 1987, Armor All's sales exceeded $100 million and company profits grew to $17 million, and in 1988 Armor All purchased Borden, Inc.'s car care products line, which included well-known name brands such as Rain Dance, Rally, and No. 7.[1] This acquisition significantly broadened the company's product line, which increased the company's gains through 1989.[1] By 1990, the company's net income dropped to less than $20 million, and then sharply worsened to less than $7 million in 1991.[1]
1990s[edit]
Sales climbed from a 1990s low of $134 million in 1993 to $217 million in 1995 (fiscal year ended March 31, 1995), as net income climbed back toward $25 million.[1] For the remainder of the decade, Armor All further capitalized upon the well-known Armor All brand name to encourage international growth and add new products.[1]
Nielsen CDG UK was appointed car care distributor for Armor All products by Clorox UK.[2] Nielsen CDG is part of the Convenience Distribution Group supplying petrol (gasoline) stations in the United Kingdom.[3]
Present[edit]
In 2010, Clorox sold Armor All and STP to Avista Capital Partners. It named the business Armored AutoGroup. In 2008, Armor All released a complete line of automotive vacuums. In April 2015, the Armored AutoGroup was acquired by Spectrum Brands.[4]

Background and history[edit]
1970s[edit]
The company that became Armor All was started in 1972 by entrepreneur and marketer Alan Rypinski.[1] In 1979, Rypinski sold all of the rights to the Armor All brand name and protectant to the San Francisco-based consumer products company McKesson Corporation.[1]
1980s[edit]
By 1987, Armor All's sales exceeded $100 million and company profits grew to $17 million, and in 1988 Armor All purchased Borden, Inc.'s car care products line, which included well-known name brands such as Rain Dance, Rally, and No. 7.[1] This acquisition significantly broadened the company's product line, which increased the company's gains through 1989.[1] By 1990, the company's net income dropped to less than $20 million, and then sharply worsened to less than $7 million in 1991.[1]
1990s[edit]
Sales climbed from a 1990s low of $134 million in 1993 to $217 million in 1995 (fiscal year ended March 31, 1995), as net income climbed back toward $25 million.[1] For the remainder of the decade, Armor All further capitalized upon the well-known Armor All brand name to encourage international growth and add new products.[1]
Nielsen CDG UK was appointed car care distributor for Armor All products by Clorox UK.[2] Nielsen CDG is part of the Convenience Distribution Group supplying petrol (gasoline) stations in the United Kingdom.[3]
Present[edit]
In 2010, Clorox sold Armor All and STP to Avista Capital Partners. It named the business Armored AutoGroup. In 2008, Armor All released a complete line of automotive vacuums. In April 2015, the Armored AutoGroup was acquired by Spectrum Brands.[4]

YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!5 of 5Easy to apply, hints providedArmor All® 78004 - Extreme Tire Shine, 22 oz.This product works great because a) it's relatively cheap and b) gives a good shine without looking hideous

Basically, it doesn't provide that ultra-greasy look you might get at a $50 detail operated by some homeless looking guy who applied a layer of grease to your tires. Instead, you get a new-tire looking effect that simply looks good all the time.

Easy to apply- just spray on. However, make sure you try to spray on uniformly and don't put too much. But before you do that, if you're applying this while the car is in your garage or driveway, cut up some cardboard boxes and drive over them. This way, all the residual droplets wont stain your concrete. Let the liquid sit for the recommend amount of time, then go out and use a paper towel to dab, not scrub, away excess dirt and liquid. Make sure you do not leave any traces of liquid because if you do so, the next time you drive your car, centrifugal force will stream even small traces of excess liquid right off to your side panels. JPosted by John (Asheville, NC) / January 20, 2015Was this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!4 of 5Armor All Leather Cleaning Wipes - Very good for leather seat cleaning - cannister is hit or miss thThe first time we used them, I was very surprised at the amount of grime that came off of the seats. Now that we use these wipes regularly, the seats look great and less dirt exists.

The reason for four stars -- the quality control of the wipes' canister is just not good, as we have had brand new packages opened dry, others drying out within a short period of time, and then others staying nice and damp all the way until the last wipe was used. Since we like the wipes but no longer trust the canister, we immediately dump all contents (wipes and fluid) into a large zip-lock bag for safekeeping. That works well, but we really should not have to do this... so, four stars instead of five.

Highly recommend this product if you have a similar need... but think about keeping them in a zip-lock bag or something with a good seal.JPosted by Jim (Ross, ND) / January 12, 2015Was this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!5 of 5Truly MultipurposeArmor All® 78513 - Multi-Purpose Cleaner Trigger, 16 oz.I've been using this since I got my first car in 2003. It gets out all the dirt scratches from stepping into the car, and any stains on your upholstery. I always use it to scrub out stains in my floor mats, it's great! I love that it doesn't leave a film like the original Armor All, but I guess that's because the original has a different purpose. This is the only thing I use to clean my car with, and unfortunately the only place I can find it locally is on base, which I no longer have access to. Honestly, I love this stuff so much I'd be happy to get it as a gift.

Someone once thought it funny to pour orange soda into my car when it was hot out and I left my window cracked--too bad I didn't have this then! It's worked so well at getting out soda and juice stains; the interior of my car (mats included) is a light beige, so it gets dirty way too easily--this removes stains quickly and keeps it looking new. JPosted by Jose (Hollis Ny, NY) / January 8, 2015Was this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!3 of 5It could be betterArmor All® 77958 - Extreme Tire Shine, 15 oz.It does make the tires shine and look nice, however it claims to last for weeks and it doesn't. Days at best, and any rain washes it right off. The trigger bottle is incredibly cheap. If you tilt it at all it won't spray, which is annoying because you have to kinda turn the bottle sideways to spray the lower part of the tire to coat everything evenly. When there's enough left for just a couple more applications it gets frustrating because it doesn't want to spray. FPosted by Fred (Fort Collins, CO) / January 3, 2015Was this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!4 of 5Great if they stay dryThese wipes are great to keep in your car. A can to clean the vinyl, a can to protect it and a can to clean the glass.

It sure beats keeping a roll of paper towels and a bottle of surface cleaner and glass cleaner in your car. I tuck these in the center console and just pull them out when I'm in a drive-thru or at a long red light.

The regular price is a little higher than what you might pay at an auto parts store, so you need to keep an eye out for price drops, but you get 75 towels all-together, so they'll last a long time. It's nice if you have Amazon Prime and can get the free shipping. Otherwise, you might get a better deal elsewhere.

I've bought similar wipes in the past and the problem I've always had is that they tend to dry up after a few months. I've only had these for a few weeks, so I can't attest to the longevity yet, but so far, they've stayed quite moist. If I still have some wipes left after a few months, I'll update my review with the results. JPosted by Joseph (Hillsboro, OR) / December 27, 2014Was this review helpful for you? YesThis review was helpful for 0 user!5 of 5This is THE BEST CLEANER for anything periodArmor All® 17233 - Multi-Purpose Cleaner Pump, 4 oz.I have been using this cleaner for over 25 years and it is the best product available for cleaning anything. I use it around the house for many things. Vinyl products look new after cleaning. It is better than any so-called household cleaners. It actually cleans better than them and the best part, it doesn't leave any residue. Most anything looks new after cleaning. Vinyl chairs, anything with plastic or painted surface, clean your toaster or clean anything you are reconditioning to make it look presentable. It wipes clean and won't leave any streaks or residue. It's a must have to clean your car surfaces before using Armor All Protectant. Upholstery looks new after using this and Armor All.

Make sure you cover what ever you don't want sprayed with newspaper or something. I did a strip on the front of the hood and didn't cover the entire hood the first time and spent a good deal of time cleaning up. Overspray on this stuff is pretty sticky and a pain to get off. You use the bug and tar cleaner spray to get the overspray off. Follow the directions and make sure the edge is still wet when you peel off your tape or the edge will peel up and tear. The Clear isn't really clear, its more of a clear matte finish. But does provide good protection from rock chips etc. Good product for the price.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
