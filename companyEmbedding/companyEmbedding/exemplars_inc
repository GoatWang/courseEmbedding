You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

Our Mission
EXEMPLAR INC. is committed to 
becoming a leading inventor of a broad range of innovative consumer products.  
This objective is achieved by way of extensive, ongoing research and development 
of inventions and related intellectual property (i.e., registered patents, 
trademarks, copyrights, etc.) for commercialization.  Our mission is guided 
by the following principle:
 




			NOVELTY
+   
			UTILITY
+   
			INGENUITY
=   
			INVENTION



 
 
Novelty + Utility + Ingenuity = Invention ™
 
NOVELTY: means the product must 
be original and the first of its kind in the world.
UTILITY: means the product must 
be operative and have a useful function.
INGENUITY: means the product 
must not be obvious to those of average skill in the art, and must elicit a 
"why-didn't-I-think-of-that" reaction.
Together these three elements 
form the basis for  INVENTION of an innovative product.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

What People Are Saying


I recently had the opportunity to reflect on our students' growth since they have been using Exemplars. What pleases me is the degree to which I see them developing the ability to explain their solutions using reasoning and strong language ...
J. Francisco
Principal



Our school subscribes to the Exemplars Library. I find the formative tasks aligned to the Common Core are strong and can be easily embedded in any curriculum. Having a more accessible and more challenging version of each task provides teachers' support as they have the resources to problem solve across different levels of understanding in their classrooms … Students are enjoying the tasks and are demonstrating a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts of the standards as they apply formal math language, accurate representations and connections.

Rubrics













Exemplars rubrics are excellent tools for assessing student work and for encouraging student self- and peer-assessment.
Our performance material includes standards-based rubrics that define what work meets today's standards, allowing teachers (and students) to distinguish between different levels of performance. 
Our rubrics have four levels of performance: Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner (meets the standard) and Expert. Exemplars uses two types of rubrics:

Standards-Based Assessment Rubrics are used by teachers to assess student work in Math, Science and Writing. Exemplars material includes both a general rubric as well as task-specific rubrics.


Student Rubrics are used during peer- and self-assessments and feature kid-friendly language and symbols.

Students can also use our Assessment Rubrics (and annotated anchor papers) to compare their work to during peer- and self-assessments. Based on student performance, teaching and learning strategies can be adjusted.

Here's What People Are Saying


I was amazed to see the differentiation and the student examples. So many times we see the problems, but not actual student work. Thank you so much for allowing me to see student work and the DIFFERENT ideas so that it's not me creating "mini mes" but showing students how to arrive at the answer in many different ways!

I am a special education teacher and I have been using the math Exemplars with my students. They enjoy doing them and have actually asked to do them. I have noticed that with each problem we solve more and more students are trying to stretch their thinking so they can become 'Experts.'
