            How will I know if my question receives an answer?
          


              As soon as we have an answer to your question, you'll receive an email notification directing you back to the discussion page.
            


            I received a notification that my question was successfully submitted, but my post isn't up there. Why do you toy with me?
          

Sorry for the confusion! You probably asked a question that was already submitted to us. When multiple customers ask the same question, we'll only post it once, but we'll still notify each customer when the relevant answer is posted.

What if I have a question and the deal q&a is closed?


              Like youth, deal q&a pages are fleeting. In order to convey their preciousness, we close them after a deal has ended. Luckily, we keep the portal to childhood open at 
              
                our contact page
              
              . Send us a message from there and we'll be more than happy to take care of you!
            

If Groupon is a cat and you’re cultivating the very curiosity that kills, aren’t you a dangerous hypocrite?

Yes.

TCM Raw Materials









Branches and Leaves for TCM
In December 2009, Yew Pharmaceutical received authorization from HFDA approving the sale of a yew-based TCM as a secondary treatment of cancer and certain other disorders, including uric disorders, certain liver diseases and menstrual discomfort. This TCM, sold under the brand name Zi Shan, has been approved to be sold under both prescription and over-the-counter drug categories. We also believe that Zi Shan may provide general beneficial effects on overall health. According to the Quintessence of Materia Medica, published in August 2006 by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences – Institute of Medicinal Plants, the Northeast yew plays a role as a diuretic, detumescence and in restoring menstrual flow. The approval from HFDA allows Yew Pharmaceutical to sell Zi Shan throughout the PRC.
TCMs utilize a range of therapies, often adjunctive to Western treatment including herbs, diet, massage, osteopathic manipulation, breathing, deep relaxation and exercise (chi gong) in a holistic approach. We sell processed yew leaves and branches to TCM maker Yew Pharmaceutical (12% of our consolidated revenue), to make into powder which they sell under the brand name Zi Shan, both prescription and OTC throughout the PRC.

The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this 
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any of the proceeds from 
the sale of these shares. We have agreed to bear the expenses relating to the 
registration of the shares for the selling security holders.


We believe that we face little competition within the PRC for the growth and 
cultivation of yew trees because of the amount of space needed for proper 
cultivation of yew trees, the long period to maturity of the yew tree, the 
difficulties of propagation, the scarcity of yews and the regulation of the 
yew industry in the PRC. Because of the need for governmental approval to grow, 
cultivate and commercialize yew trees, we believe that there are high barriers 
to entry to our industry. 

Most of our competitors are smaller companies that do not have cloning 
technology and therefore have to engage in substantially longer growing cycles 
to commercialize yew trees. Our main competitors in the growth of yew trees 
and cultivation of yew cuttings include Zhejiang Changshan Mandiya Yew Science 
and Technology Limited Company, located in Zhejiang, China; and Luo Yang Madia 
Yew Science and Technology Development Limited Company, or Luo Yang, located 
in Henan, China. For example, Luo Yang has only approximately 300 mu 
(approximately 50 acres) of yew seedlings under cultivation. 

There is significant competition for the sale of furniture, handicrafts and 
potted trees in the PRC. This is a highly fragmented industry in the PRC with
innumerable competitors and little, if any, concentration of market share 
locally, regionally or nationally. Many of our competitors are probably larger 
than we are and can devote more resources than we can to the manufacture, 
distribution and sale of furniture, handicrafts and potted trees. Additionally,
many of our competitors sell furniture and handicrafts, not made of yew trees, 
at prices considerably lower than the premium prices at which we sell our 
products. However, we believe that there is relatively little competition 
within the Chinese domestic market for our premium-priced yew products, 
primarily because of the scarcity of yew trees and the regulation of the yew 
industry in the PRC. We believe that we are the only business in the PRC that 
has been given permission to produce furniture and handicrafts from yew 
timber. 

While we do not manufacture TCM or any taxol-based product ourselves, we could 
be seen as indirectly competing with companies that do manufacture taxol-based 
medicine. We face potential competition from many providers of TCM for many 
ailments. With respect to TCM specifically for use as a secondary treatment 
for cancer, we may be seen to compete with companies such as Fujian Leephick 
Pharmaceutical Limited Company, or Fujian Leephick, located in Wuping, China, 
and Qi Ao Chinese Medicine Tablet Co., Ltd., or Qi Ao, located in Anguo City, 
Hebei Province, China. Fujian Leephick is a fairly new company that we believe 
is only in an early stage of its research and development. Qi Ao can be 
differentiated from our company in that Qi Ao does not cultivate yew trees and
requires third party supply of raw materials to produce TCM, whereas we produce 
the raw materials and sell them to our affiliate under the Development 
Agreement for the production of TCM, thereby providing a reliable supply of 
raw materials combined with the financial assurance of being paid up-front 
rather than being paid depending upon the timing and amount of sales to 
purchasers of the TCM. 

Ningbo Green-Health Pharmaceutical Company Co., Ltd. is a leading manufacturer 
of food and drugs with substantially greater financial and other resources 
than ours. However, taxol-based medicine is only one of Ningbo’s products and 
they do not produce any other yew-based products other than taxol-based 
medicine.


Company Description
The Company, through YBP; its wholly-owned subsidiaries Yew HK and JSJ; and 
its VIE, HDS; is a major grower and seller of yew trees and manufacturer of 
products made from yew trees in China. We also sell raw material, including 
the branches and leaves of yew trees, used in the manufacture of


 traditional 
Chinese medicine, or TCM. The yew raw material contains taxol, and TCM 
containing yew raw material has been approved in the PRC for use as a secondary 
treatment of certain cancers, meaning it must be administered in combination 
with other pharmaceutical drugs. The yew industry is regulated in the PRC 
because the yew tree is considered an endangered species. 

We believe that our business is built upon five unique components: 

• We have entered into several land use agreements with various parties, which 
  provide the potential for us to grow a large number of yew trees on 
  approximately 1,017,713.5 mu (approximately 169,619 acres) over the next few 
  decades, although we cannot currently estimate the total number of trees we 
  will grow or the total amount of land we will put into production over such 
  period. (Mu is a Chinese measurement of land that is equivalent to 
  approximately 0.167 acres.)  

• We employ proprietary, patented accelerated growth technology, “Northeast 
  Yew Asexual Reproduction Method”, or the Asexual Reproduction Method, to 
  bring yew trees to commercialization decades faster than growing yew trees 
  naturally.  

• Because of our more productive and faster rate of yew cultivation, we have 
  a sufficient supply of raw material to allow us to use the branches and 
  leaves, rather than the bark, of yew trees, to sell to customers for the 
  purpose of making TCM. The yew industry is highly regulated in the PRC because 
  the yew tree is considered an endangered species. By harvesting only branches 
  and leaves of yew trees we respond to both environmental sensitivities and 
  regulations, because cutting the bark of the yew trees will damage the trees 
  and stop it from growing new branches.  

• We have permits from the Heilongjiang provincial government to sell our 
  yew trees and manufacture handicrafts using yew timber. We believe that we 
  are one of only a handful of companies in the PRC with permissions to 
  manufacture handicrafts using yew timber.  

• The TCM raw materials and yew tree segments of our business are tax-free 
  in the PRC.  

Using patented accelerated growth technology developed by our founder and 
President, Zhiguo Wang, based on principles of asexual propagation and 
cloning, we can bring yew trees to maturity and commercialize them in as 
little as two-to-three years, compared to more than 50 years needed for 
naturally grown yew trees. Additionally, we have permits from the Heilongjiang 
provincial government to sell our yew trees and products made from yew trees. 
We believe that we are one of only a few companies in the PRC with such 
permission. 

We operate in three business segments: TCM raw materials, yew trees and
handicrafts. We sell raw materials in the form of yew tree branches and leaves
to our customers, primarily an affiliate, to manufacture TCM containing taxol.
We began the TCM raw materials segment in 2010.

Our TCM raw materials business became our largest operating segment in 2011 and
is expected to continue to contribute an increasing percentage of net revenue in
future periods.

In December 2009, another company owned directly and indirectly primarily by Mr.
Wang, Heilongjiang Yew Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Yew Pharmaceutical, received
approval from the Heilongjiang Food and Drug Agency, or HFDA, to sell Zi Shan, a
TCM to be sold under both prescription and over-the-counter drug categories. Zi
Shan contains taxol, and the TCM is approved in the PRC as a secondary treatment
of cancer, meaning it must be administered in combination with other
pharmaceutical drugs. In February 2010, we began selling to Yew Pharmaceutical
branches and leaves of yew trees, which is more environmentally responsible than
using the bark of yew trees, to extract taxol.

We also derive a significant amount of our revenue from the sale of yew
seedlings and trees to state-owned enterprises and private businesses for
reforestation in Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province, in northeastern
China, as well as the sale of potted yew trees to retail customers.
Additionally, we generate revenue from the sale of handicrafts, including
furniture, made from yew timber. All of our revenue is derived from the Chinese
domestic market.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, our TCM raw materials revenue
represented approximately 59.2% of consolidated revenue (including 12.4% of
consolidated revenues to related parties); sale of yew trees represented
approximately 38.3% of consolidated revenue; and the sale of handicrafts
represented approximately 2.5% of consolidated revenue (including 0.1% of
consolidated revenues to related parties). For the nine months ended September
30, 2011, our TCM raw materials revenue represented approximately 60.2% of
consolidated revenue (including 26.5% of consolidated revenues to related
parties); sale of yew trees represented approximately 37.7% of consolidated
revenue; and the sale of handicrafts represented approximately 2.1% of
consolidated revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2011, our TCM raw
materials revenue represented approximately 58.0% of consolidated revenue
(including 23.3% of consolidated revenues to related parties); sale of yew trees
represented approximately 40.3% of consolidated revenue; and the sale of
handicrafts represented approximately 1.7% of consolidated revenue. For the year
ended December 31, 2010, our TCM raw materials revenue represented approximately
55.5% of consolidated revenue (including 25.9% of consolidated revenues to
related parties); sale of yew trees represented approximately 41.6% of
consolidated revenue; and the sale of handicrafts represented approximately 2.9%
of consolidated revenue. We expect that sales from our TCM raw materials segment
will become an increasingly important source of revenue for us.

Under Article 27 of the Law of the PRC on Enterprises Income Tax and Article 15
of the provisional regulations of the PRC on Value Added Tax, we do not pay any
tax, including income tax and value added tax, or VAT, in our TCM raw materials
and yew tree segments. Our current VAT exemption certificate is valid from July
1, 2005 through December 31, 2016 and our current income tax exemption
certificate is valid from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2058. We pay
taxes on handicrafts made from yew timber.

Zhiguo Wang, the founder of the Company and our President, does not devote all
of his time to the Company’s business. We estimate that Mr. Wang devotes
approximately 71% of his time, or approximately 120 hours per month, to the
Company’s business. He devotes about 12% of his time, or approximately 20 hours
per month, to the business of Yew Pharmaceutical and the balance of his time, or
approximately 28 hours per month, to the business of other companies in which he
is involved. These allocations are approximate only and are subject to change
depending upon the particular projects and changing needs of the individual
businesses in which he is involved.

The executive offices of HDS, our operating entity, are located in Harbin City,
the capital of Heilongjiang Province in the PRC. Our four nurseries used to
cultivate yew trees, and our production facilities to manufacture products made
from yew trees, are located in and around Harbin. We also have a facility in
Harbin where we exhibit and warehouse potted yew trees, handicrafts and
furniture.

YBP was incorporated in Nevada on November 5, 2007.

Yew Bio-Pharm Group









About Us









Yew Bio-Pharm Group, Inc., through its operating entity, Harbin Yew Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd (HDS), is a major grower and seller of yew materials used to produce traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs), yew trees and yew handicrafts in China. HDS was founded in 1996 as a private enterprise to grow and cultivate yew trees on 19,759 mu(approximately 2,957 acres) of land near Harbin and incorporated under the laws of the People’s Republic of China. In 2003, it was granted rights to develop and use yew resources from the Department of Forestry of Heilongjiang Province.
Because the yew tree is considered an endangered species, it is a regulated industry in the PRC. By harvesting only branches and leaves of yew trees we respond to both environmental sensitivities and regulations, because cutting the bark of the yew trees will damage the trees and stop it from growing new branches. Yew raw material contains taxol, and TCM containing yew raw material has been approved in the PRC for use as a secondary treatment of certain cancers.

Additionally, we have permits from the Heilongjiang provincial government to sell our yew trees and products made from yew trees. We believe that we are one of only a few companies in the PRC with such permission.
The Company operates four nurseries near Harbin, China capable of growing 2 million yew nursery seedlings per year and also operates production facilities to manufacture yew handicrafts. Given its reserve of yew trees, patented technology that allows us to bring yew trees to maturity much faster than naturally-growing yew trees and improving operational efficiencies, the Company believes it is well positioned for the future.
