About Adamas

 

Adamas develops new medicines to improve the daily lives of those affected by chronic neurologic disorders. Approximately 36 million people in the United States suffer from conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease. Symptoms associated with these disorders can be treated sub-optimally due to tolerability issues, which may limit the amount of drug that is present when patients need relief.
Adamas has pioneered a platform to develop medicines for chronic neurologic disorders based upon an understanding of time-dependent biologic processes responsible for disease activity and drug response. We translate this understanding into medicines to provide demonstrable symptomatic relief from chronic neurologic disorders without additional tolerability issues. With this platform we:

discover insights about temporal patterns of disease activity and drug response
identify known drugs with potential activity in targeted disorders
invent a synchronized drug profile to match underlying disease activity and drug response patterns
develop new medicines that release the drug to match the desired drug profile, first as single agents and then in fixed-dose combinations
commercialize new products alone and with partners

Our lead program, ADS-5102,  is a high-dose amantadine, taken once-daily at bedtime, in development for levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) in people with Parkinson’s diseased.  A New Drug Application (NDA) supporting ADS-5102 for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in people with Parkinson’s disease is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of August 24, 2017.  ADS-5102 has additional opportunities to provide potentially symptomatic treatment of other chronic neurologic disorders such as multiple sclerosis walking impairment, post-stroke walking impairment, and several other indications. We are also investigating ADS-4101 (lacosamide) for the treatment of partial onset seizures in patients with epilepsy. Additionally, through our license to Allergan, our portfolio includes two medicines commercially available in the United States for indications relating to Alzheimer’s disease: Namzaric® (memantine hydrochloride extended-release and donepezil hydrochloride) capsules and Namenda XR® (memantine hydrochloride) extended-release capsules. Adamas is eligible to receive royalties on sales of Namenda XR and Namzaric beginning in June of 2018 and May of 2020, respectively. Our business strategy is to continue to discover, develop and commercialize new treatment solutions for patients independently or in collaboration with partners.
NAMENDA XR® and NAMZARIC® are registered trademarks of Merz Pharma GmbH & Co. KGaA.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
