We are Emerging Markets®









Gramercy is a $5.8 billion dedicated emerging markets investment manager based in Greenwich, CT with offices in London, Hong Kong and Mexico City with a presence in Lima and Buenos Aires. The firm, founded in 1998, seeks to provide investors with superior risk-adjusted returns through a comprehensive approach to emerging markets supported by a transparent and robust institutional platform. Gramercy offers both alternative and long-only strategies across all asset classes (USD debt, local currency debt, high yield corporate debt, distressed debt, equity, private equity and special situations). Gramercy is a Registered Investment Advisor with the SEC and is a Signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment (UNPRI).
 



Emerging Markets – Our Edge

The investment professionals at Gramercy have dedicated their careers to emerging markets.  Our investment team has an extensive distressed credit core competency.  Due to the hands-on nature of distressed investing, Gramercy has fostered local market relationships that are not easily replicated. For nearly three decades, our investment team has cultivated these deep-rooted, unique local relationships. We believe the combination of our pan-emerging markets expertise and local market relationships give Gramercy a distinct advantage in emerging markets.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

An Introduction to Gramercy







Gramercy was founded in 1998 by Robert Koenigsberger, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer, to exploit distressed investment opportunities in emerging markets. 
Gramercy has historically been known as an emerging markets distressed debt specialist, however, as the asset class evolved, so too has our firm. In the infancy of the asset class, emerging markets consisted almost entirely of defaulted debt. Today, the range of investment instruments in emerging markets has expanded to mirror that of developed markets. In response to this evolution, Gramercy has thoughtfully and deliberately expanded our investment capabilities. We offer a wide range of investment solutions across emerging markets. 
Gramercy’s experience predates our founding by over ten years.  Many of our investment professionals have been active investors in emerging markets for their entire careers, which has provided them with a thorough understanding of the complexities of the asset class.  Due to the multi-asset collaborative effort of our Investment Committee, the firm is afforded a unique perspective of the market.
Our extensive emerging markets experience, particularly within the distressed arena, has allowed us to develop deep local relationships in emerging markets countries. In addition to these relationships, our dedicated research team, one of the largest dedicated EM credit research teams in the industry, is able to provide our portfolio managers with the knowledge, confidence and ability to make sound decisions.

Strategies

Alternatives
Long-Only Debt
Long-Only Equity
UCITS







Alternatives

Emerging Markets Distressed Debt and Special Situations – Seeks to provide superior long-term capital appreciation through proactive, distressed investing in emerging markets corporate, sovereign or quasi-sovereign entities. Strategies target stressed/distressed and defaulted bonds which are typically large, global Eurobond issues, governed by U.S. or U.K. law, underwritten in public capital markets and generally U.S. dollar denominated. Opportunities are identified by our proprietary, fundamental research and both liquid/stressed and distressed/defaulted credits are evaluated to benefit our various mandates. Positions are then sized relative to market liquidity. Alpha generation takes place through bottom-up, intensive credit evaluation/monitoring combined with the top-down perspective of a highly experienced team of career-dedicated emerging markets investors. Portfolios are hedged typically using sovereign credit default swaps. 
Emerging Markets Multi-Asset – Seeks to generate high, uncorrelated returns that are tail-risk aware. Offers a single solution to provide diversified global emerging markets exposure to Gramercy’s existing emerging market alternative strategies across a variety of asset classes as well as direct investments in these same asset classes when that approach is deemed more appropriate. The strategy invests in liquid investments in distressed, credit, equity and special situations. Active asset allocation and risk controls are implemented by a highly experienced pan-emerging markets investment team collaborating at the portfolio level.

Emerging Markets – Our Edge

The investment professionals at Gramercy have dedicated their careers to emerging markets.  Our investment team has an extensive distressed credit core competency.  Due to the hands-on nature of distressed investing, Gramercy has fostered local market relationships that are not easily replicated. For nearly three decades, our investment team has cultivated these deep-rooted, unique local relationships. We believe the combination of our pan-emerging markets expertise and local market relationships give Gramercy a distinct advantage in emerging markets.

Czech Government Considering Options For OKD
Apr 7 16
The Czech government is considering taking over OKD, a.s., the production subsidiary of New World Resources Plc (LSE:NWR), as an option to prevent the company's collapse, ministers said. Principal creditors and owners of NWR have asked the state to help to restructure the mining group. But the government has been reluctant to provide aid to OKD whose previous owners paid out dividends, leveraged it and split off non-core assets. But it also fears that if the mining group collapses this could hurt the economy. "It would be ideal for OKD to continue operating without problems, laying off minimum number of miners and for the current owners and creditors to leave," Finance Minister Andrej Babis told reporters after a cabinet meeting that discussed the situation. He said owners could "hand over" OKD and creditors sell their debt for "minimum" amount. Other options ranged from insolvency to some form of debt reduction, he said. Industry Minister Jan Mladek said he had offered the firm's main owners and creditors, known as AHG, to sell the firm and its debt at a meeting with AHG last week, but AHG declined to quote a price it would seek. AHG includes Ashmore Investment Management Limited, Gramercy Funds Management LLC and M&G Investment Management Limited. An AHG spokesman had no response to the ministers' statements.

GREENWICH, Conn., Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- This press release is being disseminated by Gramercy Funds Management LLC, as agent for and on behalf of the funds and accounts for whom it acts as investment manager or advisor ("Gramercy"), as required by National Instrument 62-103 of the Canadian Securities Administrators in connection with the filing by Gramercy of an amended early warning report regarding securities of Banro Corporation ("Banro") over which Gramercy has control or direction. The amended early warning report is being filed in connection with the announcement yesterday of a proposed plan of arrangement of Banro under the Canada Business Corporations Act to effect a comprehensive recapitalization transaction (the "Plan") in respect of which Gramercy has entered into a support agreement (the "Support Agreement"). A copy of the Support Agreement and Banro's news release describing the Plan in more detail will be filed by Banro on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.








Currently, Gramercy has control or direction over (a) 8,294,250 common shares of Banro, (b) warrants to acquire 18,300,000 common shares of Banro, and (c) 11,533.480 exchangeable preferred shares of Twangiza (Barbados) Limited ("TBL") and 11,533.480 exchangeable preferred shares of Namoya (Barbados) Limited ("NBL"), representing an aggregate of approximately 16.97% of Banro's currently issued and outstanding common shares (assuming Gramercy exchanges all of its exchangeable preferred shares and exercises all of its warrants pursuant to the terms thereof).
Pursuant to the terms of the Plan, the TBL and NBL exchangeable preferred shares (including accrued and unpaid dividends) over which Gramercy has control or direction, together with 10.00% senior secured notes of Banro due March 1, 2017 over which Gramercy has control or direction and the Banro term loan due March 1, 2017 under which Gramercy is a lender, would all be exchanged for a combination of new senior secured notes and common shares of Banro (based on the sum of the face value of the TBL and NBL exchangeable preferred shares plus any accrued and unpaid dividends and the face value of the existing senior notes and term loan outstanding).  Pursuant to the terms of the Support Agreement and the Plan, Gramercy has agreed to purchase 300,000 preferred shares of Banro Group (Barbados) Limited ("BGB") from another supporting party prior to implementation of the Plan.  Upon acquisition by Gramercy, such BGB preferred shares would also be exchangeable for common shares of Banro based on the value of the BGB preferred shares. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and the Support Agreement, upon implementation of the Plan, it is expected that Gramercy would have control or direction over approximately 334,000,000 common shares of Banro (inclusive of its existing common share holdings) and warrants to acquire 18,300,000 common shares of Banro, representing an aggregate of approximately 31.02% of Banro's issued and outstanding common shares (assuming Gramercy exercised all of its warrants).  The final determination of the amount of common shares to be controlled or directed by Gramercy upon implementation of the Plan will take into account (i) the value of the BGB preferred shares Gramercy acquires as contemplated above; and (ii) the amount of dividends accrued to the Plan implementation date on the TBL and NBL exchangeable preferred shares.  
The securities of Banro over which Gramercy has control or direction are held for investment purposes. Gramercy may, subject to market conditions and in compliance with applicable securities laws, make additional investments in, or dispositions of, securities of Banro. 
The head office of Banro is located at: 1 First Canadian Place100 King St. West, Suite 7070Toronto, OntarioCanada M5X 1E3
The address of Gramercy is:20 Dayton AvenueGreenwich, CT 068030USA
