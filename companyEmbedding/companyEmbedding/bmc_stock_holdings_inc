As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

ATLANTA, May  08, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BMC Stock Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:BMCH) ("BMC" or the "Company"), one of the nation's leading providers of diversified building products and services in the U.S. residential construction market, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the "Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures" section of this press release.
First Quarter 2017 Highlights, Compared to the Prior Year Period

Net sales of $757.7 million, an increase of 4.2%, including accelerating growth in March
Ready-Frame® sales of $34.1 million, an increase of 68%
Net income of $3.7 million, an increase of $10.5 million
Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) of $33.6 million, a decrease of $0.1 million
Diluted earnings per share of $0.06, an increase of $0.16 per share
Adjusted net income per diluted share (non-GAAP) of $0.11, an increase of $0.03 per share
Successfully completed two acquisitions (including one in April), enhancing the Company's footprint and value-added capabilities in the Washington, DC and Dallas/Fort Worth markets
Reaffirmed expectation of total annual run rate cost savings from the merger of $46 million to $52 million by the end of 2017

Peter Alexander, President and Chief Executive Officer of BMC, commented, "The solid fundamentals supporting an improving housing market, combined with our internal growth initiatives aimed at growing our higher-margin categories, should enable us to deliver notable profit growth for 2017.  As has been widely reported, however, unusually high levels of precipitation in certain of our western markets delayed construction and curtailed our rate of growth at the start of the year.  During the first quarter, net sales increased 4.2%, but encouragingly accelerated as the quarter concluded, as March sales grew more than 9% and that higher growth rate continued in April."
Jim Major, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of BMC, added, "Lumber and sheet goods costs rose sharply during the first quarter and again in April.  While we expect rising commodity costs to result in higher net sales and gross profit dollars in future months, such rapid and extensive moves in product costs minimized our ability to achieve more meaningful gross margin percentage improvements in the first quarter.  Rising commodity costs may continue to constrain incremental EBITDA margins in the second quarter as increased selling prices have not yet been fully absorbed into the market.  As a result, we are redoubling our efforts to drive improved operating expense leverage over the balance of 2017."

During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company generated solid improvements in net income and earnings per share ("EPS") and continued to make substantial progress on its merger integration plan.

First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Compared to Prior Year Period

Net sales increased 4.2% to $757.7 million.  The Company estimates net sales increased 2.8% as a result of lumber and sheet goods commodity price inflation and 1.4% as a result of increased volumes.  Excluding California and Houston, which experienced weather and macro-related year-over-year declines, respectively, the Company's net sales increased 7.9%.
Gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to 23.5%, as compared to 22.9% for the first quarter of 2016.  Gross profit in the prior year was impacted by $2.9 million of inventory step-up charges, or 0.4% of prior year net sales. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.0% to $148.9 million.  The increase was primarily due to higher diesel fuel prices, costs associated with newly-opened facilities in Jacksonville, FL and Cumming, GA, as well as other investments in staffing and capacity to serve expected increases in sales volumes. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 19.6%, compared to 19.5% for the first quarter of 2016.
Depreciation expense, including the portion reported within cost of sales, increased to $13.0 million, compared to $11.4 million in the first quarter of 2016.  The increase was primarily driven by replacements and additions of delivery fleet, material handling equipment and operating equipment.
Amortization expense was $3.8 million, compared to $5.2 million in the first quarter of 2016.  This decrease related to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized.
Interest expense decreased to $6.1 million, compared to $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2016.  This decrease primarily resulted from the successful refinancing of the Company's long-term notes in September 2016.
Other income, net decreased to $0.3 million, compared to $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2016.  This decrease primarily related to $1.0 million of insurance proceeds received during the prior year related to a fire at one of the Company's facilities during 2015. 
Net income increased $10.5 million to $3.7 million, including merger and integration costs of $4.4 million.
Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) increased 42% to $7.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted net income of $5.4 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2016.
Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) decreased 0.4% to $33.6 million.
Adjusted EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) declined 20 basis points to 4.4%.
Cash used in operating activities of $3.9 million primarily resulted from seasonal increases in working capital and increased inventory investments due to rising costs for lumber and lumber sheet goods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Total liquidity as of March 31, 2017 was approximately $293.0 million, which included cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 million and $288.2 million of borrowing availability under the Company's asset-backed revolver.  Capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2017 totaled $10.7 million.  These expenditures were primarily used to fund purchases of vehicles and equipment to support increased sales volume and replace aged assets, and facility and technology investments to support our operations.  In addition, the Company acquired approximately $1.8 million of assets during the first quarter of 2017 under capital lease arrangements, consisting primarily of material handling equipment.
Strategic Acquisitions
Consistent with the Company's previously stated intention to execute a growth strategy through both organic and inorganic means, on March 27, 2017, BMC acquired substantially all of the assets of Code Plus Components, LLC ("Code Plus").  With this transaction, the Company added a high-quality structural components operation and truss manufacturing capability to its value-added offerings in the Washington, DC metro area.  In 2016, Code Plus generated net sales of $14.2 million, primarily from the sale of roof and floor trusses and engineered wood products.
In addition, on April 3, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Texas Plywood & Lumber Company, Inc. ("TexPly"), enhancing its value-added offerings and footprint in the Dallas/Fort Worth market.  Founded in 1953, TexPly is a leading supplier of production millwork and doors for single-family and multi-family residential construction in the greater Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan area and generated net sales of $55.2 million during 2016.
Outlook
"The fundamentals supporting the single-family housing segment, including job growth, rising wages, historically low interest rates and low levels of inventory all provide confidence that we will continue to see a rising demand environment, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on this improvement," said Peter Alexander.  "With moderating weather out west, we expect increased top line growth in the upcoming quarters and expect at least a 50% increase in Ready-Frame® sales for full year 2017 as compared to 2016.  For the full year, we expect to achieve significant improvements in profitability as we continue to implement our growth strategies and realize improved operating expense leverage."

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income are intended as supplemental measures of the Company's performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP.  The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and operating results.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) plus interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, merger and integration costs, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition costs, impairment of assets and inventory step-up charges.
Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.
Adjusted net income is defined as net income (loss) plus merger and integration costs, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition costs, impairment of assets, inventory step-up charges and after tax effecting those items.

Company management uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income for trend analyses, for purposes of determining management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes.  Adjusted EBITDA is used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and the board of directors.  The Company believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income provide additional tools for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other distribution and retail companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.  However, the Company's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  Company management does not consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income in isolation or as alternatives to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.  The principal limitation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements.  Some of these limitations are: (i) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; (ii) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; (iii) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay taxes; (iv) Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (v) although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and (vi) Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBITDA do not consider the potentially dilutive impact of issuing non-cash stock-based compensation.  In order to compensate for these limitations, management presents Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income in conjunction with GAAP results.  Readers should review the reconciliations of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income below, and should not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business.

Stock Overview BMC


Check out most popular rated ticker today. No detailed headlines or description can be found in our database for this stock ticker symbol. Typically, when a stock ticker symbol changes it\'s because it merges or is being acquired by another public company. A ticker symbol might also change if the company is late with filing the quarterly filings with the SEC. This is normally shown by adding an E on the end. The E means they are delinquent in filings. If a company were to go bankrupt it would add a Q at the end of the symbol. If a company were to just IPO is might have a D on the end. Please keep in mind too that some indexes and funds might simply just not have a corporate description. It could also mean the stock was de-listed to a lower over the counter exchange.
