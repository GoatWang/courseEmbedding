Member, Board of Directors

                    2012 - ?                  


TherapeuticsMD, Inc.

                    TherapeuticsMD is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on creating safe and effective branded prescription, generic prescription, and over-the-counter (non-prescription) products targeted exclusively for women. We are driven to pursue the development and commercialization of three advanced hormone replacement products designed to alleviate the symptoms of and reduce the health risks resulting from menopause-related hormone deficiencies, including hot flashes, osteoporosis, and vaginal dryness. These proposed hormone replacement products, which contain estrogen and progestin alone or in combination, are being tested to provide equivalent efficacy at lower doses, enabling an enhanced side effect profile compared with competing products. These proposed hormone replacement therapy products have received Investigational New Drug acceptance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

We plan to begin phase 3 clinical trials of all three developmental candidates in 2013. We intend to leverage and grow our current marketing and sales organization to commercialize these products in the United States assuming the successful completion of the FDA regulatory process. We are also evaluating various other indications for our hormone technology, including oral contraception, preterm birth, vulvovaginal atrophy, and premature ovarian failure. The oral progestin market was approximately $400 million in 2011 U.S. sales; the estrogen market was approximately $800 million; and the combination Progestin/Estrogen market was $600 million.

As we expand the clinical development of our proposed hormone replacement products, we continue to market and grow our branded prescription and over-the-counter product lines consisting of prenatal vitamins, vegan DHA, iron supplements, Vitamin D supplements, natural menopause relief products, and scar tissue and stretch mark creams under our vitaMedMD brand and our generic prescription prenatal vitamins under our BocaGreenMD Prena1 name.

Our sales model focuses on the "4Ps": patient, provider, pharmacist, and payor. We market and sell our current products through a national sales force of full-time professionals that call on healthcare providers in the OB/GYN market space, as well as through our website directly to consumers. We strive to demonstrate to physicians that prescribing or recommending our products enables them to realize office efficiencies and patient and payor cost savings over competitive products, strategies, and distribution models. In addition, our products offer health care providers an alternative to patients to meet their individual nutritional and financial requirements related to co-pay and cost of care considerations. We also believe that our combination of brand, generic, and over-the-counter lines allows physicians, women, and payors cost-effective alternatives for top quality care.

Our fully staffed customer care center uses current customer relationship management technologies to respond to health care providers, pharmacies, and consumers via incoming and outgoing telephone calls, e-mails, and live-chat. We also facilitate repeat customer orders through our auto-ship feature

Robert LaPenta to Lead New York City's 2016 Columbus Day Parade
24-May-2016

Columbus Citizens Foundation Names Robert LaPenta as Grand Marshal of the 72nd Columbus Day Parade
New York, NY, May 25, 2016 - The Columbus Citizens Foundation announced today that it has named foundation member Robert V. LaPenta as the Grand Marshal of the 72nd Columbus Day Parade, which will take place on Fifth Avenue on Monday, October 10, 2016. Mr. LaPenta is a driven and successful executive and philanthropist, renowned for his leadership experience in the aerospace, defense and electronics industries.
The annual Columbus Day Parade, organized by the Columbus Citizens Foundation and presented by the Conair Corporation, is the world's largest celebration of Italian-American heritage and culture in the United States.  

The Columbus Day Parade was first started in 1929 when New York City businessman and Italian immigrant Generoso Pope led a parade from East Harlem to Columbus Circle. The parade has since become an ongoing celebration of the contributions of Italian Americans to the landscape of New York and to the United States.  
As Grand Marshal, Mr. LaPenta will lead dozens of marching bands and floats and hundreds of marching groups in a non-stop parade of family entertainment and Italian-American celebration.
Raised in a three-family home in Yonkers, New York, Mr. LaPenta was one of three children raised by first generation Italian-American immigrants and currently resides in Westport, Connecticut. Mr LaPenta is Founding General Partner of Aston Capital Partners, a newly formed private investment company specializing in military intelligence, homeland security companies and companies involved in green technology.  He often speaks of the importance that education has played in the development of his career and has said that, instead of comic books, he grew up reading the business pages.
Mr LaPenta was the first member of his family to attend college, and credits much of his success to hard work and focus. At his alma mater, Iona College, he is responsible for donating the largest single gift in that institution’s history.  He has been an active and proud member of the Columbus Citizens Foundation since 1994, and was previously an Honoree at the Foundation’s 2011 Columbus Day Celebrations.
"Mr. LaPenta is a game changer in the world of business, and we are incredibly honored to have him not only as Grand Marshal of this year’s parade but also as a member of our foundation," said Angelo Vivolo, President of the Columbus Citizens Foundation.  "His selection as Grand Marshal exemplifies the core purpose of the Columbus Day Parade – to celebrate the achievements, success and heritage of the Italian American."
"It is a true honor to be named Grand Marshal of a parade that celebrates Italian-American achievement," said Mr. LaPenta. "I cannot wait to lead the march down Fifth Avenue with my family in October.”
UPDATE: Chef, Author and Philanthropist Mario Batali and Federica Marchionni will join Grand Marshal Robert LaPenta in the Columbus Citizens Foundation’s 2016 Columbus Day Celebrations

 New York, NY, July 11, 2016 - The Columbus Citizens Foundation announced today that it has named culinary trailblazer Mario Batali and visionary business leader Federica Marchionni as honorees of the 2016 Columbus Day Parade. They will join top executive Robert LaPenta, who was previously announced as 2016 Grand Marshal.
Angelo Vivolo, President of the Columbus Citizens Foundation, said of the announcement: “Mario and Federica are not only leaders in their respective industries, but they are also true visionaries admired throughout the city.  Their selection as honorees is a testament to their many accomplishments.  To have our Grand Marshal Robert LaPenta lead the parade with Mario and Federica by his side speaks to the vitality and importance of Italians and Italian Americans in the fields of food, fashion and business.”
Batali is a celebrated and much beloved New Yorker, and has received multiple awards and recognition for his cookbooks, restaurants and Eataly marketplaces. He can be seen every weekday hosting ABC’s daytime talk show, “The Chew”. 
“Italians and Italian Americans over the years have made a huge culinary impact in the United States and particularly New York City,” Batali remarked, “And I’m proud to be a part of that history.”
Marchionni most recently headed renowned US clothing brand Lands’ End and has the distinction of being the only female Italian CEO of a major US company. She has also held positions as brand chief at Ferrari and President of Dolce&Gabana USA Inc.  
“I am very proud of my Italian heritage and equally proud to be in my adoptive country of the United States,” Marchionni said, “Whether through movies, fashion, food or lifestyle trends, Italians have the ability to cast a spell on America and the world, and I love being a part of that long tradition.”
In addition to planning the Columbus Day Parade, the Columbus Citizens Foundation currently provides over 700 scholarships at elementary, high school and college level to Italian-American students who have academic ability but lack financial means. This educational support resonates strongly with the 2016 honorees.  “With hard work, resilience and the right opportunities, extraordinary things can happen,” Marchionni commented, “And the Columbus Citizens Foundation helps provide those opportunities.”  
“Education is a vital building block that so many children do not receive,” said Batali, “I am happy to be helping support a Foundation that provides scholarship to so many deserving students.”

The annual Columbus Day Parade, organized by the Columbus Citizens Foundation and presented by the Conair Corporation, is the world's largest celebration of Italian-American heritage and culture in the United States. The Columbus Day Parade was first started in 1929 when New York City businessman and Italian immigrant Generoso Pope led a parade from East Harlem to Columbus Circle and has since become an ongoing celebration of the contributions of Italians and Italian Americans to the United States.
