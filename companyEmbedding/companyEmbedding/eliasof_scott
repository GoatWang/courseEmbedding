  Cerulean Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:CERU), a clinical-stage company developing nanoparticle-drug conjugates (NDCs), today announced that Scott Eliasof, PhD, has been promoted to the role of Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, effective immediately. Dr. Eliasof joined Cerulean in 2007 and was appointed Vice President of Research in 2011.  "For the past ten years, Scott has been one of the driving forces behind our NDC innovations, and we are pleased to expand his role at this critical time for our Company," said Christopher D. T. Guiffre, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cerulean. "Our versatile NDC platform created our proprietary pipeline, including CRLX101 and CRLX301, and enabled our recently-announced collaboration with Novartis, which includes potential milestone payments for up to five targets. We look forward to Scott's leadership and continued contributions as we advance this pipeline and platform."  Before joining Cerulean in 2007, Dr. Eliasof was the director of the Chemical Biology Platform at the Broad Institute, directing a multi-disciplinary team of professional scientists and technicians in the fields of synthetic chemistry, analytical chemistry, high-throughput screening, computational science, and software engineering. This interdisciplinary organization is closely affiliated with the laboratory of Stuart Schreiber from Harvard University and is one of the largest and oldest academic screening centers in the country. Prior to joining the Broad Institute, Dr. Eliasof worked at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, where he managed scientific teams in cellular biology, molecular biology, neuroscience, and bioinformatics for a large-scale genomics-based drug discovery program. Earlier in his career, Dr. Eliasof was at Neurocrine Biosciences, where he played a key role in the exploration of glutamate transporters in the field of stroke and neurological disorders. Dr. Eliasof earned his B.S. from MIT in electrical engineering, Ph.D. from the University of California at Berkeley in neuroscience, and completed his post-doctoral fellowship at the Vollum Institute in Portland, Oregon.

      the fields of synthetic chemistry, analytical chemistry, high-throughput 
      screening, computational science, and software engineering. This 
      interdisciplinary organization is closely affiliated with the laboratory 
      of Stuart Schreiber from Harvard University and is one of the largest 
      and oldest academic screening centers in the country. Prior to joining 
      the Broad Institute, Dr. Eliasof worked at Millennium Pharmaceuticals, 
      where he managed scientific teams in cellular biology, molecular 
      biology, neuroscience, and bioinformatics for a large-scale 
      genomics-based drug discovery program. Earlier in his career, Dr. 
      Eliasof was at Neurocrine Biosciences, where he played a key role in the 
      exploration of glutamate transporters in the field of stroke and 
      neurological disorders. Dr. Eliasof earned his B.S. from MIT in 
      electrical engineering, Ph.D. from the University of California at 
      Berkeley in neuroscience, and completed his post-doctoral fellowship at 
      the Vollum Institute in Portland, Oregon.

WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cerulean 
      Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:CERU), a clinical-stage company developing 
      nanoparticle-drug conjugates (NDCs), today announced that Scott Eliasof, 
      PhD, has been promoted to the role of Senior Vice President and Chief 
      Scientific Officer, effective immediately. Dr. Eliasof joined Cerulean 
      in 2007 and was appointed Vice President of Research in 2011.
    
“Our versatile NDC 
      platform created our proprietary pipeline, including CRLX101 and 
      CRLX301, and enabled our recently-announced collaboration with Novartis, 
      which includes potential milestone payments for up to five targets. We 
      look forward to Scott’s leadership and continued contributions as we 
      advance this pipeline and platform.”

      “For the past ten years, Scott has been one of the driving forces behind 
      our NDC innovations, and we are pleased to expand his role at this 
      critical time for our Company,” said Christopher D. T. Guiffre, 
      President and Chief Executive Officer of Cerulean. “Our versatile NDC 
      platform created our proprietary pipeline, including CRLX101 and

      look forward to Scott’s leadership and continued contributions as we

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Faculty awards and honors: There are 8 Nobel Laureates, 32 MacArthur Fellows, and 4 Pulitzer Prize winners among the current faculty.

History of UC Berkeley: Historical highlights, arranged by topic, following the campus's development — from UC's founding in 1868 to a turn-of-the-century building boom, a research explosion in the 1930s, the Free Speech Movement of the '60s, and Berkeley's key role today in science and technology revolutions.

Timeline of discoveries and contributions by UC Berkeley scholars.

Traditions of Cal: Who was the Angel of Death? What's with the "Big C" up there in the hills — and why is it sometimes green? Who wears Oski's jolly bear head and size 54 yellow sweater?

Tours and webcams: Check out what's happening on Sproul Plaza, the campus's true heart. See stunning live views of the Bay Area from the Lawrence Hall of Science's perch in the Berkeley hills.

Chancellor and administration: Information on Chancellor Robert Birgeneau, Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost George W. Breslauer, and how the university is organized. Organizational charts are included.

UC System overview and links: On the campuses, laboratories, and medical centers that comprise UC's public educational system, as well as UC's K-12 partnerships, economic impact, and agriculture and environmental resources.

The Broad Institute, Inc.


                  The Broad Institute evolved from a decade of informal and successful research collaborations among scientists in the MIT and Harvard communities.

In 1990, the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research (WICGR) was founded, and it soon became an international leader in the field of genomics and a flagship of the Human Genome Project. As early as 1995, WICGR scientists recognized the need to bring the power of genomics to the understanding of human disease. It launched pilot projects in genomic medicine, forming an unofficial collaborative network among scientists from across MIT and Harvard who pioneered new approaches to cancer and human genetics.

In parallel, Harvard Medical School-based scientists established the Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology (ICCB) in 1998, to facilitate the pursuit of chemical genetics as an academic discipline and a tool to further understand human biology and disease. In 2002, the ICCB was awarded an Initiative for Chemical Genetics (ICG) grant from the National Cancer Institute, and its successful Investigator-Initiated Screening Program facilitated small molecule screening projects for more than 80 research groups worldwide.

These projects demonstrated the power of enabling scientists to collaborate to tackle the major challenges in molecular medicine. It was clear that a new type of formal organization was required — open, collaborative, interdisciplinary, and able to organize projects at any scale. In addition, it was important that the complementary expertise of the genomic scientists and the chemical biologists across MIT and Harvard be brought together in one place to drive the transformation of medicine with molecular knowledge.

Discussions in 2002-2003 among Eli and Edythe Broad, MIT, Harvard and its affiliated hospitals, and the Whitehead Institute shaped the vision for this new institute. The extraordinary generosity of Eli and Edythe Broad, through their founding gift of $100 million (later doubled to $200 million) made it possible to formally announce the new institute in June 2003 and to launch it in May 2004. Less than four years after its launch, the Broads gave an unprecedented gift of $400 million in September 2008 to permanently endow the institute, providing long-term sustainability for its unique model of collaborative, inter-institutional research.
