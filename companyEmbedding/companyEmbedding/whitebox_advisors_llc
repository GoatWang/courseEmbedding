Alternative asset management
Whitebox Investment Principle #1
The source of investment return is the efficient reduction of risk.






About us

            Whitebox Advisors, founded by Andrew Redleaf in 1999, is an SEC Registered Investment Adviser to hedge funds and certain institutional accounts.
        

            Our team looks globally across capital structures and markets, for attractively priced asset claims. We then seek to isolate the claims we want to own from the risks we don’t, to construct positions with limited risks and asymmetric upside potential.
        

            Whitebox has offices in Minneapolis, Austin, New York, London, and Sydney.
        





Ten enduring principles to interpret constant market change

              The tenets that guide our portfolio managers through each trade they make aren’t based in Modern Portfolio Theory. They’re based in principle.
          





1

Whitebox Investment Principle #1
The source of investment return is the efficient reduction of risk.





2

Whitebox Investment Principle #2
Know the drivers of your investment; maximize exposure to the mispricing and minimize exposure to everything else.





3

Whitebox Investment Principle #3
Right or wrong, the market always has a message; listen critically.





4

Whitebox Investment Principle #4

                        Ask yourself THE 4 QUESTIONS

                        
How large is the apparent mispricing?
What is your level of confidence in the mispricing?
What is the most efficient hedge?
What is your level of confidence in the hedge?







5

Whitebox Investment Principle #5
Focus one level below the obvious.





6

Whitebox Investment Principle #6
See a lot, be a generalist. Be security agnostic.





7

Whitebox Investment Principle #7
Be more invested at the bottom than the top. If more things can go wrong than can go right, you are too close to the top.





8

Whitebox Investment Principle #8
Surprise is the enemy of thought; plan for volatile scenarios before they occur.





9

Whitebox Investment Principle #9
Avoid strategies that might overwhelm your abilities—or sensibilities.





10

Whitebox Investment Principle #10
The most dangerous mistake is the one you miss because it hasn’t lost any money—yet.

MINNEAPOLIS, Dec. 13, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Whitebox Advisors, an asset management company based in Minneapolis with more than $2.8 billion in AUM (10/31/2013), announced it hired Peter Hommeyer as product specialist, a new role for the firm that aims to improve the investor experience.  
Hommeyer will be responsible for knowing Whitebox's portfolios intimately and technically in order to represent the work of the firm's portfolio managers and Investment Committee with clients and prospective clients.   
"Peter has trading experience, portfolio management experience and investor relations experience.  As such, he has a deep understanding of the types of things Whitebox investment professionals do day-to-day, which we believe makes him perfect for this new role," said Whitebox Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Redleaf. "Peter's help means Whitebox's investment team and portfolios will be clearly represented with our clients, allowing our portfolio managers and global heads to spend more of their time managing assets." 
Hommeyer joins Whitebox with more than 20 years of investment industry experience.  In his most recent role, Hommeyer served as principal for Holland Street, LLC, a New York City-based consulting service for alternative investors and managers.  Prior to Holland Street, Hommeyer was director of research and managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald Investment Advisors, where he was head of the firm's research and investments into hedge funds and other alternative investments.  Hommeyer was a portfolio manager for Cadogan Management, LLC after beginning his career as a trader and portfolio manager for several European firms in London and Vienna.     
"I am truly humbled by the opportunity to represent Whitebox's investment team to its investors and potential investors," said Hommeyer. "I look forward to joining them to help move the firm forward."
Hommeyer holds a BA in economics from the University of Colorado, Boulder.  A Minnesota native, he will move home to Minneapolis with his wife and two sons.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
