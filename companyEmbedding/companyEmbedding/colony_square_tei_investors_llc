ShareColony Square Apartments Overview

Colony Square Apartments has a total of 80 units, all of which are Section 8 assisted living units.To determine the value of a particular housing program, we looked at the cost of rent versus the inspection score awarded to the property during its most recent inspection. Colony Square Apartments scored a value rating of 4.2 out of 5, which means the property is slightly above average for the area.Contract rent for a studio unit at this housing program is $507 USD, which makes it an decently priced option in Rutherford County. Note that as a Section 8 tenant, your rent will be based on your income. The unit is 13% less expensive than the fair market price of a non-Section 8 unit, although the rent a Section 8 tenant pays is dependent upon income.

Getting AroundThis Section 8 housing program is located in the city of Smyrna, Tennessee.  This community has a large population that commutes to work via car. In fact, approximately 96% of workers drive to work.Most families have two cars. In moving to the area, you should expect to own and maintain a vehicle in order to get around and/or commute to work.

Job OpportunitiesA large upper middle class distinguishes Smyrna from other communities in the United States.  A fair portion of the community (about 27%) makes around $75,000 to $150,000 per year.  This is a good indicator in several ways.  It means that job opportunities are fairly ample.  Additionally, the local education system and other local services are probably of high caliber.  Nonetheless, the local cost of living may also be higher than in other areas of the United States.
