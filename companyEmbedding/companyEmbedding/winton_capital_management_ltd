History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1996, physicist and investment manager David Harding left Man AHL (formerly Adam, Harding and Lueck), a systematic managed futures fund and created Winton.[4][5] Using Harding's middle name,[6] the firm began trading in October 1997 with the company's flagship fund, Winton Futures Fund.[7] When conceptualizing the firm, Harding drew inspiration from Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island, New York hedge fund management company. Winton employs statisticians, engineers and physicists, to pursue investment strategies based on scientific research and analysis.[8]
According to Harding, Winton had difficulty attracting clients as a commodity trading advisor (CTA), because investors preferred hedge fund strategies that focused on the equity market rather than futures contracts.[6] However, using fees that were lower than industry standards, the firm was able to secure investors.[6][9]
Early years[edit]
In October 1997, Winton's first futures fund was launched with approximately $1.6 million in assets. The fund lost nearly 13% of its value in the first month but ended the year up 3.49%. In the following three years Winton returned gains of: 52.18% in 1998, 15.07% in 1999 and 10.44% in 2000. By November 1999, the firm had raised $100 million in capital from investors.[4] That same year, Winton sought investors in the Japanese markets.[10] The positive returns continued until late 2001, when there was a four-month period of drawdowns following the September 11 attacks.[4]
From the company's inception through the mid-2000s, its annual rate of return was approximately 19%.[11] The number of employees and the firm's assets under advisement grew significantly in 2004, reaching $1 billion.[4]
Expansion[edit]
In September 2005, the firm launched the Winton Evolution Fund, which was designed as a mixed arbitrage and multi-strategy fund investing in a variety of financial instruments and securities.[4] The launch of this fund was part of the firm's transition, away from the futures market, and towards a more diversified strategy.[4][8] In July 2007, Petershill Fund, a private equity fund set up by Goldman Sachs Asset Management International, acquired a 9.99% stake in Winton.[11][12] According to the firm, it believed the acquisition would further increase market confidence in its operations.[11]
By 2007, Winton was managing $10 billion in total assets,[12] and was ranked as the third largest CTA by the industry journal Absolute Return.[4] In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standard of best practice endorsed by its members.[13] The following year, Winton was named Real Business's "most profitable" company of 2008, having achieved margins of 65%,[14] and was ranked the third largest private finance company in Britain by The Daily Telegraph.[15]
The firm continued to expand and "become more of a general investment firm".[8] In late 2008, the company opened a Hong Kong office, its first office outside of the UK.[10] During the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 the firm's Diversified Trading Program held up relatively well with a loss of -5.38% in 2009 after a 20.25% return the previous year.[16][17][18] The company launched the Winton Global Equity Fund in 2010 and it received UCITS approval in Europe. The fund was designed to be a long-only, portfolio using quantitative analysis.[19] The Winton Futures Fund returned an approximate annualised rate of 17% net from its inception in 1997 through 2010.[19]
Through the end of 2012, Winton had a positive return on its investments every year, except 2009 and 2012.[20][21] While Winton's individual funds are established in offshore locations, the investment advisor fees are repatriated to the United Kingdom where they are taxed.[21][22] In 2013, media coverage of the firm's founder reported that since 2006, Winton has paid nearly £521 million in British taxes, including £133 million in 2011.[23]
In September 2012, Winton became research consultants with Fortune SG Fund Management of Shanghai to help develop China's first managed futures fund.[24][25]
Organization[edit]
Operations[edit]
David Harding is the company's founder, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Winton Group.[2] Andrew Moss is the chief executive officer of Winton Investment Management[26] and Nicholas Saunders is the chief operating officer.[27] Approximately 70% of the firm's employees own shares or share options in the company.[11] Winton employs approximately 450 staff members.[1]
More than 100 of the firm's employees are academics doing mathematical research [11] and studying statistical relationships and trading patterns.[9] These highly trained specialists are organized into research teams, which peer review and test new strategies, gather data and identify trends.[7] While quant hedge funds broadly have struggled for several years just following the 2008 financial crisis, Winton remains a top recruit of quantitative minds.[28]
The majority of the firm's clients reside outside the UK and many are from the United States.[4][5]
Investment strategy[edit]
Since its inception, Winton has traded as a commodity trading advisor (CTA). It is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a CTA[6] and by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. Winton is also registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment advisor.[29]
The firm refers to itself as a "modern investment management company" [30] and employs managed futures strategies using data analysis and modelling to follow trends in global futures markets such as commodities and bonds.[31] After establishing the Winton Evolution Fund and Winton Global Equity Strategy, the firm began offering multi-strategy and equity investment programs that invest in equity markets around the world.[4][32] [33]
Winton uses research and quantitative data analysis to identify favourable trends in the market[34][32] and its focus on research differentiates it from its industry companions.[4][34] The firm uses scientific research to collect data [32] and identify patterns and develop statistical tools, which are applied to its investments.[35] Winton relies on continuous research to ensure its trading models have the highest potential for positive returns.[36] Its trading models are informed by relationships identified through applied research of market data;[32] such as volatility estimations derived from a study of the 1988 corn bull market.[36] In recent years, Winton has further developed its statistical research, focusing on big data; according to the Financial Times, in 2013 its machines processed "the equivalent of 30m King James bibles' worth of information every day".[21] In April 2013, Winton was featured in the BBC2 program Horizon: The Age of Big Data for its use of scientific analysis of data, particularly for its capture and processing of large data sets including historical data for the markets that it trades in and newly produced data from thousands of companies.[37]
Winton's futures trading is highly automated and systematic and uses computer algorithms[6] to trade futures in financial assets including equities, currencies, bonds, commodities, livestock and energy [10] in over 100 futures markets worldwide.[4] Winton uses a mix of long-term and short-term trading as part of its strategy[4] and combines uncorrelated strategies to maximize their risk-return ratio.[4][32][31] According to the firm, it uses the same mathematical tools, for research, statistical data analysis, stock selection, and futures investments.[38] From around 2008, the Winton Futures Fund has increased its allocation to cash equities.[39][40]
Funds[edit]
Winton's Diversified Program, comprising its managed accounts and Winton Futures Fund, uses different models to trade in more than 100 futures markets.[20] Winton Futures Fund is Winton's flagship and its longest running fund; a managed futures fund[41] traded on the Irish Stock Exchange.[9] The fund is trend following, focusing on longer-term trends, and as of April 2011[update], has returned an annualised rate of almost 17%.[20] The second fund launched by Winton was its Winton Evolution Fund, which began trading in September 2005. It is a multi-strategy fund with no restrictions on its investment mandate.[6][42] The Winton Global Equity Fund, designed to employ Winton's mathematical analytical methods to invest in one class of asset, was given UCITS regulatory approval in Europe in 2010.[38][19]
Assets under advisement[edit]
When Winton launched in October 1997, it held $1.6 million in assets.[4] Over the next 3 years the assets held by the firm grew to over $150 million at the end of 2000.[43] By 2004, the firm's seventh year in operation, its assets under advisement reached $1 billion.[44] In the mid-to-late 2000s, the firm experienced large inflows of capital, leading to its assets under advisement increasing rapidly from $4.8 billion in mid-2006,[5][11][45] to $12.4 billion in 2009.[31][46] Between 2010 and 2012, Winton's total assets under advisement increased by almost $15 billion, from $13.7 billion in June 2010 to $28.5 billion in February 2012.[38] As at November 2016, Winton's assets under advisement totaled $32 billion.[1]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1996, physicist and investment manager David Harding left Man AHL (formerly Adam, Harding and Lueck), a systematic managed futures fund and created Winton.[4][5] Using Harding's middle name,[6] the firm began trading in October 1997 with the company's flagship fund, Winton Futures Fund.[7] When conceptualizing the firm, Harding drew inspiration from Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island, New York hedge fund management company. Winton employs statisticians, engineers and physicists, to pursue investment strategies based on scientific research and analysis.[8]
According to Harding, Winton had difficulty attracting clients as a commodity trading advisor (CTA), because investors preferred hedge fund strategies that focused on the equity market rather than futures contracts.[6] However, using fees that were lower than industry standards, the firm was able to secure investors.[6][9]
Early years[edit]
In October 1997, Winton's first futures fund was launched with approximately $1.6 million in assets. The fund lost nearly 13% of its value in the first month but ended the year up 3.49%. In the following three years Winton returned gains of: 52.18% in 1998, 15.07% in 1999 and 10.44% in 2000. By November 1999, the firm had raised $100 million in capital from investors.[4] That same year, Winton sought investors in the Japanese markets.[10] The positive returns continued until late 2001, when there was a four-month period of drawdowns following the September 11 attacks.[4]
From the company's inception through the mid-2000s, its annual rate of return was approximately 19%.[11] The number of employees and the firm's assets under advisement grew significantly in 2004, reaching $1 billion.[4]
Expansion[edit]
In September 2005, the firm launched the Winton Evolution Fund, which was designed as a mixed arbitrage and multi-strategy fund investing in a variety of financial instruments and securities.[4] The launch of this fund was part of the firm's transition, away from the futures market, and towards a more diversified strategy.[4][8] In July 2007, Petershill Fund, a private equity fund set up by Goldman Sachs Asset Management International, acquired a 9.99% stake in Winton.[11][12] According to the firm, it believed the acquisition would further increase market confidence in its operations.[11]
By 2007, Winton was managing $10 billion in total assets,[12] and was ranked as the third largest CTA by the industry journal Absolute Return.[4] In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standard of best practice endorsed by its members.[13] The following year, Winton was named Real Business's "most profitable" company of 2008, having achieved margins of 65%,[14] and was ranked the third largest private finance company in Britain by The Daily Telegraph.[15]
The firm continued to expand and "become more of a general investment firm".[8] In late 2008, the company opened a Hong Kong office, its first office outside of the UK.[10] During the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 the firm's Diversified Trading Program held up relatively well with a loss of -5.38% in 2009 after a 20.25% return the previous year.[16][17][18] The company launched the Winton Global Equity Fund in 2010 and it received UCITS approval in Europe. The fund was designed to be a long-only, portfolio using quantitative analysis.[19] The Winton Futures Fund returned an approximate annualised rate of 17% net from its inception in 1997 through 2010.[19]
Through the end of 2012, Winton had a positive return on its investments every year, except 2009 and 2012.[20][21] While Winton's individual funds are established in offshore locations, the investment advisor fees are repatriated to the United Kingdom where they are taxed.[21][22] In 2013, media coverage of the firm's founder reported that since 2006, Winton has paid nearly £521 million in British taxes, including £133 million in 2011.[23]
In September 2012, Winton became research consultants with Fortune SG Fund Management of Shanghai to help develop China's first managed futures fund.[24][25]
Organization[edit]
Operations[edit]
David Harding is the company's founder, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Winton Group.[2] Andrew Moss is the chief executive officer of Winton Investment Management[26] and Nicholas Saunders is the chief operating officer.[27] Approximately 70% of the firm's employees own shares or share options in the company.[11] Winton employs approximately 450 staff members.[1]
More than 100 of the firm's employees are academics doing mathematical research [11] and studying statistical relationships and trading patterns.[9] These highly trained specialists are organized into research teams, which peer review and test new strategies, gather data and identify trends.[7] While quant hedge funds broadly have struggled for several years just following the 2008 financial crisis, Winton remains a top recruit of quantitative minds.[28]
The majority of the firm's clients reside outside the UK and many are from the United States.[4][5]
Investment strategy[edit]
Since its inception, Winton has traded as a commodity trading advisor (CTA). It is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a CTA[6] and by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. Winton is also registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment advisor.[29]
The firm refers to itself as a "modern investment management company" [30] and employs managed futures strategies using data analysis and modelling to follow trends in global futures markets such as commodities and bonds.[31] After establishing the Winton Evolution Fund and Winton Global Equity Strategy, the firm began offering multi-strategy and equity investment programs that invest in equity markets around the world.[4][32] [33]
Winton uses research and quantitative data analysis to identify favourable trends in the market[34][32] and its focus on research differentiates it from its industry companions.[4][34] The firm uses scientific research to collect data [32] and identify patterns and develop statistical tools, which are applied to its investments.[35] Winton relies on continuous research to ensure its trading models have the highest potential for positive returns.[36] Its trading models are informed by relationships identified through applied research of market data;[32] such as volatility estimations derived from a study of the 1988 corn bull market.[36] In recent years, Winton has further developed its statistical research, focusing on big data; according to the Financial Times, in 2013 its machines processed "the equivalent of 30m King James bibles' worth of information every day".[21] In April 2013, Winton was featured in the BBC2 program Horizon: The Age of Big Data for its use of scientific analysis of data, particularly for its capture and processing of large data sets including historical data for the markets that it trades in and newly produced data from thousands of companies.[37]
Winton's futures trading is highly automated and systematic and uses computer algorithms[6] to trade futures in financial assets including equities, currencies, bonds, commodities, livestock and energy [10] in over 100 futures markets worldwide.[4] Winton uses a mix of long-term and short-term trading as part of its strategy[4] and combines uncorrelated strategies to maximize their risk-return ratio.[4][32][31] According to the firm, it uses the same mathematical tools, for research, statistical data analysis, stock selection, and futures investments.[38] From around 2008, the Winton Futures Fund has increased its allocation to cash equities.[39][40]
Funds[edit]
Winton's Diversified Program, comprising its managed accounts and Winton Futures Fund, uses different models to trade in more than 100 futures markets.[20] Winton Futures Fund is Winton's flagship and its longest running fund; a managed futures fund[41] traded on the Irish Stock Exchange.[9] The fund is trend following, focusing on longer-term trends, and as of April 2011[update], has returned an annualised rate of almost 17%.[20] The second fund launched by Winton was its Winton Evolution Fund, which began trading in September 2005. It is a multi-strategy fund with no restrictions on its investment mandate.[6][42] The Winton Global Equity Fund, designed to employ Winton's mathematical analytical methods to invest in one class of asset, was given UCITS regulatory approval in Europe in 2010.[38][19]
Assets under advisement[edit]
When Winton launched in October 1997, it held $1.6 million in assets.[4] Over the next 3 years the assets held by the firm grew to over $150 million at the end of 2000.[43] By 2004, the firm's seventh year in operation, its assets under advisement reached $1 billion.[44] In the mid-to-late 2000s, the firm experienced large inflows of capital, leading to its assets under advisement increasing rapidly from $4.8 billion in mid-2006,[5][11][45] to $12.4 billion in 2009.[31][46] Between 2010 and 2012, Winton's total assets under advisement increased by almost $15 billion, from $13.7 billion in June 2010 to $28.5 billion in February 2012.[38] As at November 2016, Winton's assets under advisement totaled $32 billion.[1]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
In 1996, physicist and investment manager David Harding left Man AHL (formerly Adam, Harding and Lueck), a systematic managed futures fund and created Winton.[4][5] Using Harding's middle name,[6] the firm began trading in October 1997 with the company's flagship fund, Winton Futures Fund.[7] When conceptualizing the firm, Harding drew inspiration from Renaissance Technologies, a Long Island, New York hedge fund management company. Winton employs statisticians, engineers and physicists, to pursue investment strategies based on scientific research and analysis.[8]
According to Harding, Winton had difficulty attracting clients as a commodity trading advisor (CTA), because investors preferred hedge fund strategies that focused on the equity market rather than futures contracts.[6] However, using fees that were lower than industry standards, the firm was able to secure investors.[6][9]
Early years[edit]
In October 1997, Winton's first futures fund was launched with approximately $1.6 million in assets. The fund lost nearly 13% of its value in the first month but ended the year up 3.49%. In the following three years Winton returned gains of: 52.18% in 1998, 15.07% in 1999 and 10.44% in 2000. By November 1999, the firm had raised $100 million in capital from investors.[4] That same year, Winton sought investors in the Japanese markets.[10] The positive returns continued until late 2001, when there was a four-month period of drawdowns following the September 11 attacks.[4]
From the company's inception through the mid-2000s, its annual rate of return was approximately 19%.[11] The number of employees and the firm's assets under advisement grew significantly in 2004, reaching $1 billion.[4]
Expansion[edit]
In September 2005, the firm launched the Winton Evolution Fund, which was designed as a mixed arbitrage and multi-strategy fund investing in a variety of financial instruments and securities.[4] The launch of this fund was part of the firm's transition, away from the futures market, and towards a more diversified strategy.[4][8] In July 2007, Petershill Fund, a private equity fund set up by Goldman Sachs Asset Management International, acquired a 9.99% stake in Winton.[11][12] According to the firm, it believed the acquisition would further increase market confidence in its operations.[11]
By 2007, Winton was managing $10 billion in total assets,[12] and was ranked as the third largest CTA by the industry journal Absolute Return.[4] In 2007 it was a founder member of the Hedge Fund Standards Board which sets a voluntary code of standard of best practice endorsed by its members.[13] The following year, Winton was named Real Business's "most profitable" company of 2008, having achieved margins of 65%,[14] and was ranked the third largest private finance company in Britain by The Daily Telegraph.[15]
The firm continued to expand and "become more of a general investment firm".[8] In late 2008, the company opened a Hong Kong office, its first office outside of the UK.[10] During the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 the firm's Diversified Trading Program held up relatively well with a loss of -5.38% in 2009 after a 20.25% return the previous year.[16][17][18] The company launched the Winton Global Equity Fund in 2010 and it received UCITS approval in Europe. The fund was designed to be a long-only, portfolio using quantitative analysis.[19] The Winton Futures Fund returned an approximate annualised rate of 17% net from its inception in 1997 through 2010.[19]
Through the end of 2012, Winton had a positive return on its investments every year, except 2009 and 2012.[20][21] While Winton's individual funds are established in offshore locations, the investment advisor fees are repatriated to the United Kingdom where they are taxed.[21][22] In 2013, media coverage of the firm's founder reported that since 2006, Winton has paid nearly £521 million in British taxes, including £133 million in 2011.[23]
In September 2012, Winton became research consultants with Fortune SG Fund Management of Shanghai to help develop China's first managed futures fund.[24][25]
Organization[edit]
Operations[edit]
David Harding is the company's founder, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Winton Group.[2] Andrew Moss is the chief executive officer of Winton Investment Management[26] and Nicholas Saunders is the chief operating officer.[27] Approximately 70% of the firm's employees own shares or share options in the company.[11] Winton employs approximately 450 staff members.[1]
More than 100 of the firm's employees are academics doing mathematical research [11] and studying statistical relationships and trading patterns.[9] These highly trained specialists are organized into research teams, which peer review and test new strategies, gather data and identify trends.[7] While quant hedge funds broadly have struggled for several years just following the 2008 financial crisis, Winton remains a top recruit of quantitative minds.[28]
The majority of the firm's clients reside outside the UK and many are from the United States.[4][5]
Investment strategy[edit]
Since its inception, Winton has traded as a commodity trading advisor (CTA). It is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a CTA[6] and by the Financial Conduct Authority in the UK. Winton is also registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment advisor.[29]
The firm refers to itself as a "modern investment management company" [30] and employs managed futures strategies using data analysis and modelling to follow trends in global futures markets such as commodities and bonds.[31] After establishing the Winton Evolution Fund and Winton Global Equity Strategy, the firm began offering multi-strategy and equity investment programs that invest in equity markets around the world.[4][32] [33]
Winton uses research and quantitative data analysis to identify favourable trends in the market[34][32] and its focus on research differentiates it from its industry companions.[4][34] The firm uses scientific research to collect data [32] and identify patterns and develop statistical tools, which are applied to its investments.[35] Winton relies on continuous research to ensure its trading models have the highest potential for positive returns.[36] Its trading models are informed by relationships identified through applied research of market data;[32] such as volatility estimations derived from a study of the 1988 corn bull market.[36] In recent years, Winton has further developed its statistical research, focusing on big data; according to the Financial Times, in 2013 its machines processed "the equivalent of 30m King James bibles' worth of information every day".[21] In April 2013, Winton was featured in the BBC2 program Horizon: The Age of Big Data for its use of scientific analysis of data, particularly for its capture and processing of large data sets including historical data for the markets that it trades in and newly produced data from thousands of companies.[37]
Winton's futures trading is highly automated and systematic and uses computer algorithms[6] to trade futures in financial assets including equities, currencies, bonds, commodities, livestock and energy [10] in over 100 futures markets worldwide.[4] Winton uses a mix of long-term and short-term trading as part of its strategy[4] and combines uncorrelated strategies to maximize their risk-return ratio.[4][32][31] According to the firm, it uses the same mathematical tools, for research, statistical data analysis, stock selection, and futures investments.[38] From around 2008, the Winton Futures Fund has increased its allocation to cash equities.[39][40]
Funds[edit]
Winton's Diversified Program, comprising its managed accounts and Winton Futures Fund, uses different models to trade in more than 100 futures markets.[20] Winton Futures Fund is Winton's flagship and its longest running fund; a managed futures fund[41] traded on the Irish Stock Exchange.[9] The fund is trend following, focusing on longer-term trends, and as of April 2011[update], has returned an annualised rate of almost 17%.[20] The second fund launched by Winton was its Winton Evolution Fund, which began trading in September 2005. It is a multi-strategy fund with no restrictions on its investment mandate.[6][42] The Winton Global Equity Fund, designed to employ Winton's mathematical analytical methods to invest in one class of asset, was given UCITS regulatory approval in Europe in 2010.[38][19]
Assets under advisement[edit]
When Winton launched in October 1997, it held $1.6 million in assets.[4] Over the next 3 years the assets held by the firm grew to over $150 million at the end of 2000.[43] By 2004, the firm's seventh year in operation, its assets under advisement reached $1 billion.[44] In the mid-to-late 2000s, the firm experienced large inflows of capital, leading to its assets under advisement increasing rapidly from $4.8 billion in mid-2006,[5][11][45] to $12.4 billion in 2009.[31][46] Between 2010 and 2012, Winton's total assets under advisement increased by almost $15 billion, from $13.7 billion in June 2010 to $28.5 billion in February 2012.[38] As at November 2016, Winton's assets under advisement totaled $32 billion.[1]

Company background
Winton Capital Management Limited, a limited liability company registered in England and Wales, registered with the CFTC as a CTA in January 1998 and as a CPO in December 1998.  It became a member of the NFA in January 1998 and has been authorized and regulated by the FSA in the United Kingdom since June 1997.
Investment goal
The investment objective of the Diversified Program is to achieve long- term capital appreciation through compound growth. This goal is achieved by pursuing a diversified trading scheme that does not necessarily rely upon favourable conditions in any particular market, or on market direction.
Strategy
The investment strategy of the Winton Futures Program is to invest globally long and short, using leverage, in a diversified range of liquid instruments including exchange traded futures,options and forwards, currency forwards traded over the counter and other related instruments, by following a systematic investment process that is based on statistical research. Winton Futures Program follows a disciplined investment process that is based on statistical analysis of historical data. The initial stage of the process involves collecting, cleaning and organizing large amounts of data.  The Winton Futures Program uses a wide variety of data inputs including factors that are intrinsic to markets, such as price, volume and open interest; and those that are external to markets, such as economic statistics, industrial and commodity data and public company financial data. Winton conducts statistical research into the data in an attempt to quantify the probability of particular markets rising or falling, conditional on a variety of quantifiable factors. Winton’s research is used to develop mathematical models that attempt to forecast market returns, the variability or volatility associated with such returns (often described as “risk”), the correlation between different markets and transaction costs. These forecasts are used in investment strategies that determine what positions should be held to maximize profit within a certain range of risk. As a result of Winton’s research, it expects that investments made in accordance with this process will have an improved chance of being successful, which is expected to lead to profits over the long-term.

Jerry Dawson, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) - Jerry is a qualified chartered accountant with over 20 years of experience of external audit in the UK and the USA. He spent the 10 years before he joined Winton as an executive member of the PricewaterhouseCoopers leadership team in the European hedge fund sector and led their hedge fund manager assurance team. Jerry was educated in South Africa, where he matriculated from St John’s College, Johannesburg, placed ninth in South Africa. He graduated from the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg with a first class Bachelor of Commerce degree with Honours in Accounting and lectured at his old university before moving to Britain to join PricewaterhouseCoopers in 1989. Promoted to senior manager in 1998 he was seconded to the PwC Boston Alternatives Practice where clients included hedge funds and mutual fund complexes. Returning to London in 2000 Jerry specialised in serving the Alternative Investments industry providing audit and advisory, acquisition due diligence, operational risk assessment, and prudential regulatory services to both institutional and start-up alternative investment managers and funds. In 2003 Jerry was appointed Assurance Director in the Asset Management group in London and was an executive member of PwC’s Central Cluster Hedge Fund Leadership team. A regular speaker at hedge fund symposiums and conferences he wrote articles for the AIMA Journal and both internal and external PwC publications. Seeking a new challenge, Jerry joined Winton as CFO in January 2011.

There are substantial risks and potential conflicts of interest associated with managed futures programs. The success of an investment in such a program is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (“CTA”) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in futures trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. Managed futures accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. THERE IS RISK OF LOSS. YOU CAN LOSE MONEY IN A MANAGED FUTURES PROGRAM.

            What is the Fund’s objective?


        The Winton Global Equity Fund (WGEF) follows a fully-invested, non-levered equity core investment strategy that aims to achieve long-term outperformance of the MSCI World Index by systematically exploiting fundamental and price-based predictive signals and their interactions, to select those stocks with a higher probability of excess returns. Portfolio construction seeks to maximise expected returns whilst attaining a tracking error target under a strict turnover budget. Execution is lgorithmic. The models employed are continuously improved by the Firm's leading research effort.

                        There are substantial risks and conflicts of interests associated with Managed Futures and commodities accounts, and you should only invest risk capital. The success of an investment is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (CTA) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. CTAs have total trading authority, and the use of a single CTA could mean a lack of diversification and higher risk. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in commodity trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses as well as gains. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. If you use notional funding, you may lose more than your initial cash investment. Managed Futures and commodities accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. The disclosure document contains a complete description of each fee to be charged to your account by a CTA. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request. You may have market exposure even after the CTA has a request for closure or liquidation. PAST RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.
