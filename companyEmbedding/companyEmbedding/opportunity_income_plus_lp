I purchased three at that time and now am in need of more so here I am. The first ones I purchased worked fine and I will continue to use them as long as they perform as well as the first ones did.

With this order, I ordered more cartridges and received them the next day via USPS.  I was very surprised.  It seems that LD products listened to my previous comments and reacted appropriately.  That was amazing.  For any company to change how they do ship items based on feedback shows good customer support.  I am very happy with the cartridges and will be using many more of their cartridges in the future.

I was a General Appraiser and she a Residential Appraiser. We used LD Products for most of the Time we had our office at home. I have been well satisfied with LD products. Over time we accumulated a number of used cartridges.   When we used original Xerox cartridges they could be shipped back to them without our paying the cost of shipping. I don't know your current policy in that regard.    I plan to print out my order and mail payment probably prior to the 11th of July. Allowing five working days it should be on hand prior to the 18th.

WHEREAS, the Fund desires to settle the matters involving its filing delinquency described herein and voluntarily enters into this Stipulation and Agreement;
WHEREAS, Section 4-177(c) of Chapter 54 of the Connecticut General Statutes permits the resolution of a contested case by stipulation or agreed settlement;
WHEREAS, the Commissioner and the Fund acknowledge that this Stipulation and Agreement is in lieu of any court action or administrative proceeding against the Fund, its partners, officers, employees, agents or representatives adjudicating any issue of fact or law on the specific matters described herein;
WHEREAS, the Fund, through its execution of this Stipulation and Agreement, voluntarily waives any rights it may have to seek judicial review or otherwise challenge or contest the terms and conditions of this Stipulation and Agreement;
NOW THEREFORE, THE PARTIES HERETO DO MUTUALLY AGREE AS FOLLOWS:




1.

No later than the date this Stipulation and Agreement is executed by the Commissioner, Opportunity Income Plus, LP shall remit to the department via check payable to �Treasurer, State of Connecticut� the sum of one thousand three hundred dollars ($1,300) as an administrative fine;

Execution of this Stipulation and Agreement by the Commissioner is without prejudice to the right of the Commissioner to take enforcement action against Opportunity Income Plus, LP based upon a violation of this Stipulation and Agreement or the basis for its entry if the Commissioner determines that compliance is not being observed with the terms hereof or if any representation made by or on behalf of Opportunity Income Plus, LP and reflected herein is subsequently determined to be untrue;

Nothing in this Stipulation and Agreement shall be construed as limiting the Commissioner's ability to take enforcement action against Opportunity Income Plus, LP based upon evidence of which the Division was unaware on the date hereof relating to a violation of the Act or any regulation or order under the Act; and      

5.
This Stipulation and Agreement shall become binding when executed by Opportunity Income Plus, LP and the Commissioner.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Stipulation and Agreement on the dates indicated.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
