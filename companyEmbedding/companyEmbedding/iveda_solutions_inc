Iveda Solutions, Inc. Key Developments

Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group Selects Iveda Solutions, Inc for Nationwide Safe City Initiative
Apr 20 17
Iveda Solutions, Inc. announced that Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group selected the company with its exclusive reseller in Vietnam for a nationwide Safe City initiative. Along with the selection is the signing of an agreement with the first two major cities for the deployment of Intelligent Traffic Solutions and video surveillance system. The project will start immediately with each city requiring equipment installation at key intersections; the remaining intersections will be scheduled according to deployment capacity until the agreement provisions are fulfilled.


Iveda Launches IvedaHome Doorbell Camera Worldwide
Jan 5 17
Iveda Solutions, Inc. announced the launch of its IvedaHome doorbell security camera. The doorbell camera is a standalone product that retails for about $149 in the U.S. It can also be bundled with Iveda's IvedaHome automation and security system. Iveda's doorbell camera is a DIY (do-it-yourself) product that can easily be installed to replace the existing doorbell in most homes or offices. It serves as eyes and ears to what's outside the front door using a smartphone or tablet. The doorbell does not need to be pushed for the camera to capture events. Iveda's doorbell camera serves as a surveillance camera, equipped with a PIR (passive infrared) motion detector sensor. The camera will detect motion even the human eye cannot. This means motion can be detected at night and even when the lights are off. When motion is detected, an alert will be sent to the same devices and each can use the app to verify what is going on outside the door.


Iveda Announces Three Contracts Totaling $2.6 Million for Safe City Projects in Taiwan
Dec 15 16
Iveda announced three contracts signed totaling $2.6 million for safe city projects in Taiwan. The contracts were awarded by Chunghwa. With the new projects secured in Taiwan, the 2000 ZEE® camera purchase from Vietnam telecom VNPT and the 1000 ZEE camera purchase from Philippines telecom PLDT announced just last month. The three new Chunghwa Telecom contracts are part of the continuing government safe city initiatives to improve safety and quality of life throughout Taiwan. Iveda is utilizing its SafeCiti® solution consisting of its IvedaEnterprise® and Sentir cloud platforms to fulfill the requirements of the Taiwan Government. IvedaEnterprise, Iveda's enterprise-class centralized video management platform, is ideal for private cloud deployments and Sentir is its cloud platform that utilizes simple plug-and-play IP cameras.

01/05/2017 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 01/05/2017 08:05
Iveda Launches IvedaHome Doorbell Camera Worldwide New Offering for Security Integrators








        January 5, 2017
      

        MESA, Ariz. (January 5, 2017) - Iveda® (OTCQB: IVDA), worldwide enabler of cloud-based video surveillance and data management through the licensing of its Sentir® platform, today announced the launch of its IvedaHome doorbell security camera. The doorbell camera is a standalone product that retails for about $149 in the U.S. It can also be bundled with Iveda's IvedaHome automation and security system.
      

        Iveda's doorbell camera is a DIY (do-it-yourself) product that can easily be installed to replace the existing doorbell in most homes or offices. It serves as eyes and ears to what's outside the front door using a smartphone or tablet.
      

        'Seeing how well the product works from initial reseller installations overseas and how cool the features are, I installed one myself at my house and got everything up and running within half an hour,' said David Ly CEO of Iveda. 'If you're not a DIY person, it's a low-voltage device that any handyman can set up for you.'
      

        When someone rings the doorbell, all family members with the app on their devices will get an alert. Whoever pushes the answer button first on the phone app can start a conversation with the person who rang the doorbell. This can be accomplished whether you are at home or away and the person at the door will be unable to tell the difference.
      

        The doorbell does not need to be pushed for the camera to capture events. Iveda's doorbell camera serves as a surveillance camera, equipped with a PIR (passive infrared) motion detector sensor. The camera will detect motion even the human eye cannot. This means motion can be detected at night and even when the lights are off. When motion is detected, an alert will be sent to the same devices and each can use the app to verify what is going on outside the door.
      

        Iveda will sell the doorbell cameras through worldwide security integrators, telecoms and other distributors.
        'Before we focused on telecoms, we had a reseller program with security integrators in the U.S. I think a good way to re-engage is with a functional, cool new product that will excite their customers,' said Ly. 'It's a simple but effective product that does what it's supposed to do: see who's on the other side of the door before you open it and doubles as a remotely-accessible security camera.'
      

        The doorbell camera is geared toward residential customers and offices with a secure entrance. It transmits live streaming video and records on an SD card. Cloud recording is available if bundled with IvedaHome, Iveda's smarthome product.
        'We are thrilled with this new product and we will continue to bring innovative products to create and meet market demand for our partners and for Iveda to generate new revenue,' said Ly.

Iveda now has Certification from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as a Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology Provider.
Iveda has had the SAFETY Act Designation since 2009. The DHS renewed it in 2014; shortly after, Iveda began the Certification process. Iveda had to consistently prove that the technology performed as designed during the 5-year Designation period. The DHS granted the Certification status in January 2016, which placed Iveda’s technology on the  “Approved Products Lists for Homeland Security.”
SAFETY Act Certification gives liability protection for providers of anti-terrorism technologies and their customers. By contracting or using a SAFETY Act designated or certified company to provide a function within your organization, you effectively shield your company from liabilities from a terrorist act, stemming from the failure of that designated or certified company’s technology or service.
How does the SAFETY Act define an “Act of Terrorism?
Pursuant to the SAFETY Act  (A) The term “act of terrorism” means any act that the Secretary determines meets the requirements under subparagraph (b) of the Act, as such requirements are further defined and specified by the Secretary. REQUIREMENTS- (B) An act meets the requirements of this subparagraph if the act is:

is unlawful
causes harm to a person, property, or entity in the United States, or in the case of a domestic United States air carrier or a United States-flag vessel (or a vessel based principally in the United States on which the United States income tax is paid and whose insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United States), in or outside the United States
uses or attempts to use instrumentalities, weapons or other methods designed or intended to cause mass destruction, injury or other loss to citizens or institutions of the United States.

Iveda’s Certification protects our customers utilizing our video hosting and real-time surveillance technology, our partners reselling these services, and vendors we use for enabling these services.
According to Homeland Security and Defense Business Council “if a company purchases and deploys or implements a SAFETY Act-approved technology (whether Designated or Certified) and is sued following an act of terrorism for real property or personal injury damages that are caused by the qualified anti-terror technology, the customer also has the right to seek immediate dismissal of the civil claims – a very unique and powerful defense. ” [1]

Iveda Solutions Enters Mobile Video Surveillance Market with New Product


  September 30, 2010                   

For Immediate Release
********************** NEW PRODUCT RELEASE *************************
Mesa, AZ (September 30, 2010) – Iveda Solutions (OTCBB:IVDA) announced today the release of the Streaming Video Converter (SVC). The SVC is a fully integrated device that combines the functionality of a high performance video encoder and cellular broadband router. Specifically designed for digitizing analog in-vehicle mobile video systems, the SVC enables live mobile streaming video over the Internet for remote access and storage.
 
“Frost & Sullivan estimates the global Mobile Video Surveillance Market to be $1.55 billion in 2015. We are excited about the potential growth and the demand that the SVC may generate for us in monthly recurring revenue for our centralized video hosting, remote storage, and real-time surveillance services,” said David Ly, president and CEO of Iveda Solutions.
 
The SVC was designed to be plug and play, quick to install, and simple to manage for organizations of all sizes, from local tow truck companies to Fortune 500 logistics companies. The device is perfect for rapid deployment of live mobile streaming video ideal for in-vehicle applications, such as police cars, school buses, taxicabs, delivery trucks and freight trucks. It enables any analog in-vehicle video surveillance system for Iveda Solutions’ centralized video hosting, remote storage, and real-time remote surveillance services.
 
Using cellular data network, the SVC allows instant live access to video onboard a vehicle: detect bullying and vandalism in school buses, assist officers in the field, and prevent truck ambush and general theft. Iveda Solutions’ centralized video management platform allows multiple simultaneous access from any Internet-enabled device anytime, anywhere.
 
With the SVC, video footage that is traditionally stored inside the vehicle through a local recording device can now be virtualized and stored remotely at a fully fault-tolerant data center with no concerns of redundancy, reliability, and lost or damaged data.
 
Administrative time to review incidents of live and archived video is immediate, eliminating costly hours spent retrieving and pulling data from multiple vehicles and multiple recording devices. There is no need to wait for vehicles to return to the transportation yard.
 
Prior to the fully-integrated SVC, Ronald Latko, Transportation Director for the Mesa Unified School District in Arizona, tested Iveda Solutions’ converter system and hosting service on some of the Mesa school buses. “Had this cloud computing system been available seven years ago, when I first went with DVRs, I would have gone this way,” said Ronald Latko. Latko manages the district’s more than five-hundred buses, the largest school transportation fleet in the state.
 
While fleet management may have the technology to know how fast their vehicles are moving, where they are, and what they are carrying, they still can’t see them, the SVC fills this gap. Organizations can now have on-demand visual assessment of any vehicle and its environment without the added burden or expense of infrastructure build-out and back-end management. Companies can now have remote access to vehicles in the field to improve operations and to know what is happening at all times to protect their employees and valuable assets.
 
“With many companies investing in end-to-end logistics security solutions to ensure quality and safety for their people, process, and products, we believe that Iveda Solutions’ SVC will be a large contributor to the effort,” said Ly.
 
Although mobile video technology has been around for some time, its functionality has been very limited as a fixed local solution that is a reactive tool and requires a lot of time for upkeep without truly achieving its intended purpose. Such technical and operational limitations are a thing of the past with the SVC. Companies can now remotely manage their fleet of vehicles large or small while the vehicles are in motion, using in-vehicle cameras they already have.
 
“This is the wave of the future for school bus safety and security,” added Latko.

Why the Iveda® Cloud Is The ‘True’ Cloud and Why it Matters: Enabling Cloud Video Surveillance - Iveda - Enabling Cloud Video Surveillance


















































Why the Iveda® Cloud Is The ‘True’ Cloud and Why it Matters: Enabling Cloud Video Surveillance 

How Iveda’s Sentir® Platform Provides a ‘True Cloud’ Experience
 Download White Paper
Background Information
The purpose of this whitepaper is to educate current and potential partners, customers, and investors about Iveda’s cloud technology. What is unique about Iveda?
As the public continues to embrace and adopt cloud computing, some traditional NVR (network video recorder), software companies, camera manufacturers, and security integrators have rushed to capitalize on the trend, positioning their solutions as ’Cloud’, but generally do not qualify by the true definition of cloud computing. This pervasive practice – known as ‘cloudwashing’ – renaming existing products if it were Internet based in any manner[1]. This practice makes it difficult for consumers and IT professionals alike to make informed purchasing decisions.
Iveda started its grand vision of providing video surveillance services on a mass scale, by utilizing off-the shelf software and hardware and building a cloud infrastructure hosted at data centers. To test the technology and the monthly recurring revenue model, Iveda amassed customers through direct sales. The customers paid a flat monthly fee for access to cloud video surveillance hosting and real-time remote surveillance services.
Through ongoing research and development efforts, Iveda has evolved into an enabler of cloud video surveillance services, utilizing (Sentir®), its cloud video surveillance and data management platform. Today, Iveda offers Sentir to worldwide telecommunications companies (telcos), carriers, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), data centers, cable companies, and security integrators. These companies in turn bundle the video surveillance service with their other offerings. End users are provided with a license to use Sentir applications on a per device basis through a monthly subscription. Iveda benefits by making it easier to rapidly increase adoption of Sentir while providing partners with a platform that can enhance their service, increase average revenue per user (ARPU), and promote customer loyalty.
What is Cloud Computing?
First, it is important to define cloud computing. Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand hosted services to end users over the Internet. An example is an application running on a remote server instead ofon a local computer, wherein the user accesses it via the Internet, similar to accessing your bank account online or accessing your customer database from salesforce.com. Resources are shared by many users, which typically pay for a monthly fee for the service.
The security industry, or more so some of the players who have labeled their companies as “cloud video surveillance providers,” have adopted the name ‘cloud’ without fully understanding or adhering to the definition of cloud computing. In the last year or so, ‘cloud’ has become a buzzword, used very loosely – basically any camera accessible via the Internet. Video Surveillance as a Service (VSaaS) is cloud computing at its best – cloud video surveillance services delivered by a service provider to many users. Surveillance cameras that can be accessible via the Internet is not cloud computing.
We will not bore you with the history of cloud computing, but what’s important to note here is that cloud computing is not new. Some date it back to the 1950s, others say the 1960s.
According to an article published in computerweekly.com, the concept of cloud computing was attributed to two American computer scientists named J.C.R. (Joseph Carl Robnett) Licklider and John McCarthy. Licklider’s vision was for everyone in the world to be interconnected, able to access programs from anywhere; McCarthy’s idea was to sell computing similar to how a public utility sold water or electricity). He introduced the concept of time sharing in computing.
Since then, it has evolved with the Internet explosion in the 90s. Regardless, the basic concept of cloud computing remains the same. Salesforce.com, Amazon, and the many institutions that first introduced online banking are considered the early pioneers of cloud applications – even before these applications were touted cloud services.
What’s new, as far as our industry is concerned, is video surveillance in the cloud also known as Video Surveillance as a Service (VSaaS). Only in the last couple of years or so, has the security technology industry started talking about video surveillance in the cloud.
Characteristics of Cloud Computing
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) identified five essential elements of cloud model as follows:

Resource pooling – Hardware, software, networking components, and other resources are designed and combined, with different physical and virtual resources. End users share the pooled resources dynamically assigned to them by the cloud service provider based on their needs. Typically, the end user receives services without knowing the location of the resources. This can also be referred to as multi-tenancy architecture, which simply means resources (e.g., hardware, software, bandwidth) are shared by many tenants or users.
Broad network access – Applications are available, typically over the Internet, utilizing smartphones, tablets, or computers.
Rapid elasticity – Designed for easy scalability without incurring downtime whenever additional capacity is required proportionate with demand. To the end user, the capabilities for provisioning appear to be unlimited and can be provisioned at any time.
Measured service – Cloud systems typically measure resource usage and are charged by the resource they consume (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, number of users).
On-demand self-service – Typically, an end user can sign up for server time and network storage or add to an existing service within hours if not minutes, most often accomplished online without human interaction.

Common Cloud Computing Models
To further demonstrate what true cloud is, NIST identified the most common models of cloud computing as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). To reiterate, all these models are delivered by a service provider to many users, sharing the software, platform, or infrastructure. Some service providers can be a combination of two or even all three.
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)provides servers, storage, networks, and operating systems, giving SaaS and PaaS providers a physical entity to host their software or platform for delivery to their users. IaaS subscribers do not manage or control the cloud infrastructure, but have control over operating systems, storage, applications, and some networking components.
IaaS Providers
Amazon Web Services (More than 30% marketshare)
IBM
Microsoft
Rackspace
Google
Comcast
Century Link

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is more than software delivered from the cloud. It may include hardware and other tools to develop or customize applications. Again, the key is shared resources. The user only pays for what they need and they do not worry about maintaining the platform.

PaaS Providers
Force.com
Microsoft Azure
Google App Engine
CloudFoundry
AppFog

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software distribution model hosted by a service provider and is typically provided to end-users over the Internet through a subscription.

Iveda’s Sentir

Video Surveillance as a Service (VSaaS) is the newest cloud computing model, specifically for managing and archiving of video footage captured by surveillance cameras onto the cloud. Also referred to as hosted or managed video. Video surveillance refers to monitoring of activities in public areas, businesses, or commercial buildings via analog, or IP based or HD cameras for real time or later review.[2]

Iveda’s Sentir Cloud Video Surveillance Platform
Long before the security industry touted ‘cloud’ or VSaaS and even before we labeled our own services ‘cloud,’ Iveda has been developing cloud-ready video surveillance products and services since our founding days in 2003. Iveda has been adhering to the true meaning of cloud computing. It was difficult to explain the solutions we were offering our customers. We were selling surveillance cameras, but not DVRs. Instead, we hosted and stored video for our customers at our data centers.
The Sentir platform includes surveillance software, cloud management software, servers, storage, and networking protocols.
Sentir is a well-integrated and highly-optimized solution for large scale video surveillance hosting solution. Although we employ the highest industry standards of securing our network and data, Sentir can be used as private video hosting cloud platform for enterprise customers who do not want to put sensitive surveillance data on our public cloud. Sentir can also be deployed to data centers[3] for running large scale video hosting service. It is an all-in-one “cloud video platform” addressing high availability, high performance and scalability.  
Iveda became a purely SaaS company, licensing our Sentir platform to telcos, carriers, and other service providers, enabling them to offer VSaaS to their customers. We still maintain our infrastructure to service our legacy VSaaS customers.
Sentir Utilizes Distributed Storage System
Since storage is one of the biggest concerns for video surveillance systems, Sentir comes with a highly-flexible, high-performance and highly-scalable storage system.
On-Line Replication
The storage system can be configured to replication mode, which replicates files on the fly across storage servers, achieving high availability of files in the storage system. Accessing files is load balanced to multiple storage servers. This allows users to access files on demand as long as one storage server is available.
This on-line replication is   an active-active model, where every server is serving requests at the same time, compared to active-passive model where data is backed up to a slave server in the background and only the master server is serving requests. The active-active model is superior because it fully utilizes the computation of all storage servers, achieving better performance.
 

Scale-Out Storage
The scalability of traditional storage systems has limitations. As ones business grows, the storage capacity may prove insufficient and require expansion. In traditional storage systems, performance can be improved by replacing the controller. However, the storage system needs to be shut down to make the replacement. Additionally, the capability of the controller is limited by the performance of its CPU.
With scale-out storage, performance can be increased by simply adding more storage servers to the system. More storage servers in the system yield better performance. Iveda’s distributed, scale-out storage system allows customers to add more capacity without interruption. Every new storage server contributes its computing power as well as adds capacity to the system. In addition, users can increase capacity of each storage server by adding physical disks or JBODs (Just a Bunch Of Disks)
Iveda’s scale-out storage provides flexibility to users. As an example, customers requiring video recording for a longer period of time may need two storage servers for replication and each storage server equipped with multiple disks. This configuration maximizes capacity and performance at a reasonable cost. Customers seeking higher storage performance may need twice as many storage servers to handle requests in parallel.
Because scale-out storage system is flexible, customers do not need to decide how many servers they need to accommodate future data storage requirements. Iveda’s storage system allows on-line expansion; customers can expand storage capacity as needed, minimizing capital expenditures.
 

Thin-provisioning
Typically, systems administrators add capacity ahead of demand to ensure applications won’t crash.  Oftentimes, the excess storage cannot be used by other applications, wasting space.
With thin-provisioning technology, a storage administrator creates logical volume to an application as usual, but the storage system allocates physical capacity to the volume only when it is required. This means administrators can create a huge storage volume for application without actually installing the physical hard drives during initial system set up.  For example, a 1 PB (i.e., 1000TB) system may be created, but the actual physical storage system may only be 100 TB. When utilization of the physical storage approaches a predefined threshold (e.g., 90%, 90TB), administrator can dynamically add more hard drives to the system without interrupting the applications.

 
Server Virtualization Environment
Iveda provides video surveillance solutions to meet various customer needs. Each solution has different infrastructure requirements. The Sentir Rack is designed to fit customized requirements by providing a server virtualization environment. Sentir can be configured to provide both Linux and Windows virtual machines. The virtual machines Sentir provides are highly optimized for Iveda’s video surveillance solutions. Several hardware-assisted virtualization technologies are integrated for acceleration including Intel virtualization technology (Intel VT-x, Intel VT-d) for CPU acceleration and Single-Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) for network interface acceleration.
In addition, Sentir provides well-integrated virtual machine images that can be used to create surveillance-ready virtual machines. With this feature, scaling the video surveillance system is as easy as a few mouse clicks. In the near future, surveillance-ready virtual machines can even be created automatically according to pre-defined rules.
Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
Many IP (Internet Protocol) cameras (IPCAMs) in the market are P2P-based, wherein the user registers the IPCAM to a global name server with the IP address pre-assigned by the manufacturer. Upon registration, the user can directly connect to the IPCAM for live viewing. In other words, a P2P-based IPCAM is a video server by itself and includes management software within the camera that streams video content to users. Some P2P-based IPCAMs are capable of recording video to user-provided public cloud storage services such as Google Drive, Apple iCloud, or Dropbox.
The P2P-based IPCAMs, however, expose users to a massive security risk[3] since IPCAMs need to open an entry port to enable the user to connect. When there are many viewers to the live video at the same time, the bandwidth usage increases and quality decreases. Additionally, since the IPCAM is a small device having limited computing power, the quality drops significantly when handling multiple viewers.
With Iveda’s cloud-based video surveillance system, an IPCAM interacts with cloud servers only and the connection is initiated by the IPCAM, securing the IPCAM’s IP address. With high computing power and high network bandwidth of cloud servers, the system can easily handle multiple viewers. In addition, cloud servers are maintained and monitored by Iveda’s professional IT engineers, providing a highly secured environment. As video content is streamed to and recorded in cloud servers, advanced video analysis such as video enhancement, face detection, and object recognition can be applied.
Why is Peer-to-Peer Not True Cloud and Why Does it Matter
Although ‘cloud’ is a metaphor for the Internet, a camera accessible via the Internet does not make it ‘cloud.’ The term itself connotes one-to-one connection versus the inherent one-to-many nature of cloud computing. Using the Internet, P2P cameras send a live video stream to a computer or smartphone for video access using software installed on the computer or an app downloaded on the smartphone. Cloud-based IPCAMs can send unlimited video streams to the cloud for hosting, recording, and centralized video management. Live and recorded video are delivered to multiple simultaneous users through a Web browser or mobile app.
The distinction may not be important to residential users and small retail operators who may only require one or two cameras to fulfill their needs. However,for customers with multiple locations, enterprise and government customers, the distinction is important. P2P systems do not provide the flexibility and scalability compared to true cloud-based systems.
Because cloud services are typically provisioned from data centers with redundant power, abundance of bandwidth, and scalable physical infrastructure, increased demand due to growth can easily be accommodated. Cloud-based systems also provide centralized video management platform for ease of use, efficiency, and convenience.
Peer-to-Peer Diagram

In a typical P2P video surveillance system, there is no service provider housing servers and software to be shared by multiple users – no resource pooling. Each IP camera is hosted from a local computer or smartphone for live viewing. Video may be stored on that local computer or stored remotely using free storage from Amazon or Dropbox. 
True Cloud Video Surveillance as a Service (VSaaS)
In the true definition of cloud computing, it is safe to say that Iveda is one of a handful of video surveillance companies that meets the standards of cloud computing.
There are NVR companies that offer software for cloud video surveillance implementation (e.g., Milestone, Axis AVHS, and Salient), but the software itself is not cloud. Some of our legacy service offerings use both Milestone and Axis AVHS, and are being hosted at our data centers and delivered to our customers from our cloud. Iveda has evolved and now offers our own proprietary cloud platform Sentir.
Iveda’s products, services, and platform pass all the accepted standards of cloud computing. With defined characteristics such as commercial accessibility over the Web, software management from a central location, and “one-to-many” delivery model, the results are no user handling of software upgrades and patches and API availability for integration. End-users can receive feature and function upgrades over the cloud, a new camera is not always required.
End users are provided with a license to use Sentir applications on a per device basis, through a monthly subscription. To add another level of uniqueness and differentiation from other industry solutions, Sentir has an integrated cloud storage management technology with a built in software-defined storage technology that is designed with Big Data in mind.
Iveda’s Cloud Diagram

This diagram depicts Iveda’s Cloud. End users only require cameras, power, and bandwidth to send video to the Iveda Cloud and an Internet-enabled device to access video. All the processing, live and recorded video delivery, and storing video for the end user are all handled in the Iveda’s Cloud. 
Consumer-Grade vs Enterprise-Class Cloud Video Surveillance
As far as we know, there is only one other major cloud video hosting company that fits the mold of a true cloud video surveillance service provider. However this provider’s solution caters to residential and small retail operation. Its distribution channel includes big box consumer stores and online shopping portals. The system acts more like a P2P, other than its broadcasting technology, which multiple users that have the URL can access without authentication. While it provides simple video surveillance security for the home, it will not stand the test of even small businesses with multiple locations, even more so large enterprises and government entities. Iveda allows centralized management of cameras in disparate locations on a single dashboard, with one login. Other similar service offerings require the user to switch views or open multiple browser windows.
It is important to note that Iveda is not a competitor to these consumer-grade VSaaS providers; our customers (e.g., telcos, carriers, data centers, ISPs) are, which have the competitive edge since they have loyal subscribers more inclined to buy a new service offering from their trusted service provider.
Iveda’s business model is predicated on achieving quick market penetration by mass distribution through organizations with massive customer base already paying a monthly fee for services. Iveda’s VSaaS offering is a great compliment to the services these companies are providing their customers. Bundling cloud video hosting to their service packages is a natural progression.
