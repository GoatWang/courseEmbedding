Activision Blizzard Inc. Has Big Plans for Consumer Products
This new hire puts the company one step closer to becoming an interactive entertainment powerhouse.











                John Ballard
            

                (TMFRazorback)



            
            Feb 13, 2017 at 1:20PM
            
            






Skylanders Ninja. Image source: Pixabay. 

Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) recently announced it was creating a consumer products division, and it has hired Tim Kilpin, a former executive of Mattel and Walt Disney, to run it.
In a press release, the company said Kilpin "will lead the development of innovative consumer products to expand and deepen audience engagement with Activision Blizzard's iconic franchises through long-term retail partnerships, high-quality products, and all new consumer experiences."
At Walt Disney, Kilpin served as executive vice president of franchise management, where he was in charge of overseeing global cross-category plans for several Disney brands, including Disney Princess, Winnie the Pooh, Mickey Mouse, and Pixar properties.
Kilpin looks like a great hire for the game publisher, where CEO Bobby Kotick has his sights set on crossing over Activision's diverse group of characters from its game franchises to comic books, toys, apparel, and other categories.
The broader strategy
Activision has seven franchises with at least $1 billion in revenue, and each have potential to attract new audiences beyond gaming. Skylanders -- the brilliant fusion of toys and video games -- has generated over $3 billion in revenue and sold more than 250 million toys since the franchise was launched in 2011. Given Kilpin's background, Activision can further push into a market it created with Skylanders.





But the possibilities are much broader than toys and other consumer products. Activision Blizzard Studios launched Skylanders Academy, a Netflix TV show that was renewed for a third season, verifying Activision's strategy to stretch its entertainment influence beyond video games.
These initiatives fit how CEO Bobby Kotick defined Activision Blizzard's mission in a recent interview with Forbes. According to Kotick, the company's mission is "to inspire audiences to play, connect, and compete by making the most engaging entertainment in the world."
The word selection is interesting -- "inspire" points to an ambitious strategy to become an interactive entertainment leader that can reach people who don't play video games. In this respect, defining Activision Blizzard as a video game company is too narrow of a view.
Video game publishers reaching into broader categories like movies and toys is nothing new. Going back at least 20 years, there have been dozens and dozens of movie adaptations based on video games ... and the results are nothing to smile about.





But Activision has an advantage other game companies haven't enjoyed, and that is a new leader who is very dialed in to specifically designing franchises that draw a mass audience and can be expanded to other venues, whether its eSports, the silver screen, or the toy shelf. The success of the Skylanders game and TV show is validation that Activision has real potential for a video game business to finally make the successful cross-over to broader entertainment categories -- and possibly sustain it.
Activision wants to create entertainment that has longevity, and this is evident in the types of games it has released for many years. Since its first release in 2003, Call of Duty is still raking in cash for Activision.
The developers of Call of Duty have used the same techniques as successful box office action movies. The cinematic design of the gameplay has caused many to compare Call of Duty to Michael Bay movies, which are notorious for bad ratings but big box office success. The single-player campaign in the game thrives on a storyline with many action cut-scenes and numerous explosions. Activision even persuaded Kevin Spacey to contribute his acting talents to Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare in 2014.
A broader expansion brings more risks
The push into consumer products does not come without risks, as Activision will be competing with established industry heavyweights, but these leading companies are what Activision Blizzard aspires to be with its own intellectual property.





With the hire of Tim Kilpin, Activision appears set to take its consumer products to the next level.

History[edit]
Formation (2007–08)[edit]
In December 2007, Activision announced that the company and its assets would merge with fellow games developer and publisher Vivendi Games. At the time, Vivendi was best known as the holding company for the game studios Sierra Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in California. Bobby Kotick of Activision was announced as the new president and CEO, while René Penisson of Vivendi was appointed chairman.[21] The European Commission permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any antitrust issues in the merger deal.[22] On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.[23]
Vivendi was the majority shareholder, with a 52% stake in the company.[23][24] The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the NASDAQ stock market for a time under NASDAQ: ATVID, and subsequently as NASDAQ: ATVI. At this point, Jean-Bernard Levy replaced René Penisson as chairman of Activision Blizzard.[9] The merger made Activision Blizzard the parent company of Vivendi Games' former divisions.[25] While Blizzard retained its autonomy and corporate leadership in the merger, other Vivendi Games divisions such as Sierra ceased operation.[26] With the merger, Kotick was quoted stating if a Sierra product did not meet Activision's requirements, they "won't likely be retained."[26] However, a number of Sierra's games such as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon and Prototype were retained and are now published by Activision.[27]
New titles and sales records (2009–12)[edit]
Activision Blizzard does not publish games under its central name and instead uses its studios to publish games.[28] In early 2010, the independent studio Bungie entered into a 10-year publishing agreement with Activision Blizzard.[29][30] By the end of 2010, Activision Blizzard was the largest video games publisher in the world.[31] The 2011 release of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 grossed $400 million in the US and UK alone in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest entertainment launch of all time.[18] It was also the third consecutive year the Call of Duty series broke the biggest launch record; 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops grossed $360 million on day one; and 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 brought in $310 million.[15] Call of Duty: Black Ops III grossed $550 million in worldwide sales during its opening weekend in 2015, making it the biggest entertainment launch of the year.[16][17]
In 2011, Activision Blizzard debuted its Skylanders franchise,[20] which led to the press crediting the company with inventing and popularizing a new toys-to-life category.[20][32][33] The first release Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was nominated for two Toy Industry Association awards in 2011: "Game of the Year" and "Innovative Toy of the Year".[34] Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and its sequels were released for major consoles and PC, and many were released on mobile devices as well.[20]
Split from Vivendi and growth (2013–14)[edit]




Activision Blizzard at Gamescon 2013, where the company exhibited 2013 titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Skylanders: Swap Force.


On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September.[35] At the conclusion of the deal, Vivendi was no longer Activision Blizzard's parent company,[36] and Activision Blizzard became an independent company as a majority of the shares became owned by the public. Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly retained a 24.4% stake in the company overall. In addition, Kotick remained the president and CEO, with Brian Kelly taking over as chairman.[35] On October 12, 2013, shortly after approval from the Delaware Supreme Court, the company completed the buyback, along the lines of the original plan.[37] Vivendi sold half its remaining stake on May 22, 2014, reducing its ownership to 5.8%.[38]
Activision Blizzard released a new title, Destiny, on September 9, 2014. The game made over $500 million in retail sales on the first day of release, setting a record for the biggest first day launch of a new gaming franchise.[19] On November 5, 2013, the company released Call of Duty: Ghosts, which was written by screenwriter Stephen Gaghan.[39] On its first release day the game sold $1 billion into retail.[19] In 2014, Activision Blizzard was the fifth largest gaming company by revenue worldwide,[40] with total assets of US $14.746 billion and total equity estimated at US $7.513 billion.[4]
S&P 500 and new divisions (2015–16)[edit]
Activision Blizzard joined the S&P 500 on August 28, 2015, becoming one of only three companies on the list related to gaming, alongside Microsoft and Electronic Arts.[7] The company released the next iteration of the Skylanders franchise in September 2015, which added vehicles to the "toys to life" category.[41] On September 15, 2015, Activision and Bungie released Destiny: The Taken King, the follow up to the Destiny saga. Two days later, Sony announced that the game broke the record for the most downloaded day-one game in PlayStation history, in terms of both total players and peak online concurrency.[42]
Activision Blizzard announced on November 2, 2015 that it would acquire social gaming company King, creator of the popular casual game Candy Crush Saga, for $5.9 billion.[14] At an Investor Day presentation on November 6, 2015, in the wake of the Warcraft feature film, Activision Blizzard announced the formation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a film production division dedicated to creating original television series and films. Headed by producer Stacey Sher and former The Walt Disney Company executive Nick van Dyk, Activision Blizzard Studios would look to produce an animated television series based on Skylanders called Skylanders Academy and films based on the Call of Duty franchise,[13] and partner with Legendary Pictures on possible sequels to the Warcraft movie.
Activision Blizzard owns the Call of Duty and Starcraft franchises, both of which have been popular as esports.[11][43] On October 21, 2015, Activision Blizzard announced the upcoming establishment of a new e-sports division.[12] Named Activision Blizzard Media Networks, the division is led by sports executive Steve Bornstein and Major League Gaming (MLG) co-founder Mike Sepso, with assets from the acquisition of the now defunct IGN Pro League. Bornstein was appointed the new division's chairman.[11][43] On December 31, 2015, it was reported that "substantially all" of Major League Gaming's assets would be acquired by Activision Blizzard.[11][43] The New York Times reported that the acquisition was intended to bolster Activision Blizzard's push into e-sports, as well as its plan to develop an e-sports cable channel.[44] Reports indicated that MLG would be shuttered, and that the majority of the purchase price would go towards paying off the company's debt.[11][43] Activision Blizzard acquired MLG on January 4, 2016[44] for $46 million.[11][43] In November 2016, it announced the Overwatch League.

In 2009, Business Insider reported that Worlds.com was claiming it owned the patent to "the idea of a scalable virtual world with thousands of users," with the company's CEO asserting that "he intends to sue anyone who refuses to enter into licensing negotiations - including giants such as Second Life and World of Warcraft.[58] On March 30, 2012, Worlds Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Massachusetts Federal Court alleging Activision Blizzard had infringed on two patents involving 3-D virtual environments.[59] The lawsuit focused on the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises,[60] and during pre-trial oral arguments, Activision Blizzard lead counsel was quoted stating "billions were at stake."[61] Activision Publishing filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit in California on October 4, 2013,[59] asserting that Worlds, Inc. was using two Activision-owned patents in its Worlds Player software.[62]
In March 2014,[63] a Boston court ruled that Activision was not required to pay Worlds.com "for using talking avatars in popular online titles like World of Warcraft," with the judge clarifying that "the patents belonging to Worlds Inc. appear invalid because the inventions they describe already appeared in public before the patents were filed." Worlds Inc. was limited to only suing Activision Blizzard for "future acts of infringement." Indeed, the Patents themselves at that time were not deemed invalid, rather the Certificate of Correction issued by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trade Office) to cure a defect in the prosecution (filed after the Lawsuit started) required that the Federal Lawsuit be refiled in order to take advantage of the earlier patent priority date. Worlds opted to allow the case to move forward, preserving the timeline and eliminating Activision Blizzards opportunity to directly file a USPTO Patent and Appeal Board challenge. Activision had not exercised its right to file a USPTO appeal to challenge the patents in question during the 1 year statutory time period. In response, Worlds.com announced they would instead be pursuing the recent release Call of Duty: Ghosts for damages.[64] The Worlds, Inc. case against Blizzard Activision was heard on October 3, 2014, with results still unannounced by the end of the year.[65] On June 26, 2015, the Massachusetts courts released a ruling that clarified technical terms for the lawsuit.[66] On November 28, 2016, the United States Patent and Appeal Board ruled claims 5 and 7 valid on US Patent 7493558.[67] The challenge of the US Patent 7493558 was instituted by Bungie, Inc.,an Activision Blizzard game developer.[68]

History[edit]
Formation (2007–08)[edit]
In December 2007, Activision announced that the company and its assets would merge with fellow games developer and publisher Vivendi Games. At the time, Vivendi was best known as the holding company for the game studios Sierra Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in California. Bobby Kotick of Activision was announced as the new president and CEO, while René Penisson of Vivendi was appointed chairman.[21] The European Commission permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any antitrust issues in the merger deal.[22] On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.[23]
Vivendi was the majority shareholder, with a 52% stake in the company.[23][24] The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the NASDAQ stock market for a time under NASDAQ: ATVID, and subsequently as NASDAQ: ATVI. At this point, Jean-Bernard Levy replaced René Penisson as chairman of Activision Blizzard.[9] The merger made Activision Blizzard the parent company of Vivendi Games' former divisions.[25] While Blizzard retained its autonomy and corporate leadership in the merger, other Vivendi Games divisions such as Sierra ceased operation.[26] With the merger, Kotick was quoted stating if a Sierra product did not meet Activision's requirements, they "won't likely be retained."[26] However, a number of Sierra's games such as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon and Prototype were retained and are now published by Activision.[27]
New titles and sales records (2009–12)[edit]
Activision Blizzard does not publish games under its central name and instead uses its studios to publish games.[28] In early 2010, the independent studio Bungie entered into a 10-year publishing agreement with Activision Blizzard.[29][30] By the end of 2010, Activision Blizzard was the largest video games publisher in the world.[31] The 2011 release of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 grossed $400 million in the US and UK alone in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest entertainment launch of all time.[18] It was also the third consecutive year the Call of Duty series broke the biggest launch record; 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops grossed $360 million on day one; and 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 brought in $310 million.[15] Call of Duty: Black Ops III grossed $550 million in worldwide sales during its opening weekend in 2015, making it the biggest entertainment launch of the year.[16][17]
In 2011, Activision Blizzard debuted its Skylanders franchise,[20] which led to the press crediting the company with inventing and popularizing a new toys-to-life category.[20][32][33] The first release Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was nominated for two Toy Industry Association awards in 2011: "Game of the Year" and "Innovative Toy of the Year".[34] Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and its sequels were released for major consoles and PC, and many were released on mobile devices as well.[20]
Split from Vivendi and growth (2013–14)[edit]




Activision Blizzard at Gamescon 2013, where the company exhibited 2013 titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Skylanders: Swap Force.


On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September.[35] At the conclusion of the deal, Vivendi was no longer Activision Blizzard's parent company,[36] and Activision Blizzard became an independent company as a majority of the shares became owned by the public. Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly retained a 24.4% stake in the company overall. In addition, Kotick remained the president and CEO, with Brian Kelly taking over as chairman.[35] On October 12, 2013, shortly after approval from the Delaware Supreme Court, the company completed the buyback, along the lines of the original plan.[37] Vivendi sold half its remaining stake on May 22, 2014, reducing its ownership to 5.8%.[38]
Activision Blizzard released a new title, Destiny, on September 9, 2014. The game made over $500 million in retail sales on the first day of release, setting a record for the biggest first day launch of a new gaming franchise.[19] On November 5, 2013, the company released Call of Duty: Ghosts, which was written by screenwriter Stephen Gaghan.[39] On its first release day the game sold $1 billion into retail.[19] In 2014, Activision Blizzard was the fifth largest gaming company by revenue worldwide,[40] with total assets of US $14.746 billion and total equity estimated at US $7.513 billion.[4]
S&P 500 and new divisions (2015–16)[edit]
Activision Blizzard joined the S&P 500 on August 28, 2015, becoming one of only three companies on the list related to gaming, alongside Microsoft and Electronic Arts.[7] The company released the next iteration of the Skylanders franchise in September 2015, which added vehicles to the "toys to life" category.[41] On September 15, 2015, Activision and Bungie released Destiny: The Taken King, the follow up to the Destiny saga. Two days later, Sony announced that the game broke the record for the most downloaded day-one game in PlayStation history, in terms of both total players and peak online concurrency.[42]
Activision Blizzard announced on November 2, 2015 that it would acquire social gaming company King, creator of the popular casual game Candy Crush Saga, for $5.9 billion.[14] At an Investor Day presentation on November 6, 2015, in the wake of the Warcraft feature film, Activision Blizzard announced the formation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a film production division dedicated to creating original television series and films. Headed by producer Stacey Sher and former The Walt Disney Company executive Nick van Dyk, Activision Blizzard Studios would look to produce an animated television series based on Skylanders called Skylanders Academy and films based on the Call of Duty franchise,[13] and partner with Legendary Pictures on possible sequels to the Warcraft movie.
Activision Blizzard owns the Call of Duty and Starcraft franchises, both of which have been popular as esports.[11][43] On October 21, 2015, Activision Blizzard announced the upcoming establishment of a new e-sports division.[12] Named Activision Blizzard Media Networks, the division is led by sports executive Steve Bornstein and Major League Gaming (MLG) co-founder Mike Sepso, with assets from the acquisition of the now defunct IGN Pro League. Bornstein was appointed the new division's chairman.[11][43] On December 31, 2015, it was reported that "substantially all" of Major League Gaming's assets would be acquired by Activision Blizzard.[11][43] The New York Times reported that the acquisition was intended to bolster Activision Blizzard's push into e-sports, as well as its plan to develop an e-sports cable channel.[44] Reports indicated that MLG would be shuttered, and that the majority of the purchase price would go towards paying off the company's debt.[11][43] Activision Blizzard acquired MLG on January 4, 2016[44] for $46 million.[11][43] In November 2016, it announced the Overwatch League.

In 2009, Business Insider reported that Worlds.com was claiming it owned the patent to "the idea of a scalable virtual world with thousands of users," with the company's CEO asserting that "he intends to sue anyone who refuses to enter into licensing negotiations - including giants such as Second Life and World of Warcraft.[58] On March 30, 2012, Worlds Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Massachusetts Federal Court alleging Activision Blizzard had infringed on two patents involving 3-D virtual environments.[59] The lawsuit focused on the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises,[60] and during pre-trial oral arguments, Activision Blizzard lead counsel was quoted stating "billions were at stake."[61] Activision Publishing filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit in California on October 4, 2013,[59] asserting that Worlds, Inc. was using two Activision-owned patents in its Worlds Player software.[62]
In March 2014,[63] a Boston court ruled that Activision was not required to pay Worlds.com "for using talking avatars in popular online titles like World of Warcraft," with the judge clarifying that "the patents belonging to Worlds Inc. appear invalid because the inventions they describe already appeared in public before the patents were filed." Worlds Inc. was limited to only suing Activision Blizzard for "future acts of infringement." Indeed, the Patents themselves at that time were not deemed invalid, rather the Certificate of Correction issued by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trade Office) to cure a defect in the prosecution (filed after the Lawsuit started) required that the Federal Lawsuit be refiled in order to take advantage of the earlier patent priority date. Worlds opted to allow the case to move forward, preserving the timeline and eliminating Activision Blizzards opportunity to directly file a USPTO Patent and Appeal Board challenge. Activision had not exercised its right to file a USPTO appeal to challenge the patents in question during the 1 year statutory time period. In response, Worlds.com announced they would instead be pursuing the recent release Call of Duty: Ghosts for damages.[64] The Worlds, Inc. case against Blizzard Activision was heard on October 3, 2014, with results still unannounced by the end of the year.[65] On June 26, 2015, the Massachusetts courts released a ruling that clarified technical terms for the lawsuit.[66] On November 28, 2016, the United States Patent and Appeal Board ruled claims 5 and 7 valid on US Patent 7493558.[67] The challenge of the US Patent 7493558 was instituted by Bungie, Inc.,an Activision Blizzard game developer.[68]

History[edit]
Formation (2007–08)[edit]
In December 2007, Activision announced that the company and its assets would merge with fellow games developer and publisher Vivendi Games. At the time, Vivendi was best known as the holding company for the game studios Sierra Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in California. Bobby Kotick of Activision was announced as the new president and CEO, while René Penisson of Vivendi was appointed chairman.[21] The European Commission permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any antitrust issues in the merger deal.[22] On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.[23]
Vivendi was the majority shareholder, with a 52% stake in the company.[23][24] The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the NASDAQ stock market for a time under NASDAQ: ATVID, and subsequently as NASDAQ: ATVI. At this point, Jean-Bernard Levy replaced René Penisson as chairman of Activision Blizzard.[9] The merger made Activision Blizzard the parent company of Vivendi Games' former divisions.[25] While Blizzard retained its autonomy and corporate leadership in the merger, other Vivendi Games divisions such as Sierra ceased operation.[26] With the merger, Kotick was quoted stating if a Sierra product did not meet Activision's requirements, they "won't likely be retained."[26] However, a number of Sierra's games such as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon and Prototype were retained and are now published by Activision.[27]
New titles and sales records (2009–12)[edit]
Activision Blizzard does not publish games under its central name and instead uses its studios to publish games.[28] In early 2010, the independent studio Bungie entered into a 10-year publishing agreement with Activision Blizzard.[29][30] By the end of 2010, Activision Blizzard was the largest video games publisher in the world.[31] The 2011 release of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 grossed $400 million in the US and UK alone in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest entertainment launch of all time.[18] It was also the third consecutive year the Call of Duty series broke the biggest launch record; 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops grossed $360 million on day one; and 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 brought in $310 million.[15] Call of Duty: Black Ops III grossed $550 million in worldwide sales during its opening weekend in 2015, making it the biggest entertainment launch of the year.[16][17]
In 2011, Activision Blizzard debuted its Skylanders franchise,[20] which led to the press crediting the company with inventing and popularizing a new toys-to-life category.[20][32][33] The first release Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was nominated for two Toy Industry Association awards in 2011: "Game of the Year" and "Innovative Toy of the Year".[34] Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and its sequels were released for major consoles and PC, and many were released on mobile devices as well.[20]
Split from Vivendi and growth (2013–14)[edit]




Activision Blizzard at Gamescon 2013, where the company exhibited 2013 titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Skylanders: Swap Force.


On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September.[35] At the conclusion of the deal, Vivendi was no longer Activision Blizzard's parent company,[36] and Activision Blizzard became an independent company as a majority of the shares became owned by the public. Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly retained a 24.4% stake in the company overall. In addition, Kotick remained the president and CEO, with Brian Kelly taking over as chairman.[35] On October 12, 2013, shortly after approval from the Delaware Supreme Court, the company completed the buyback, along the lines of the original plan.[37] Vivendi sold half its remaining stake on May 22, 2014, reducing its ownership to 5.8%.[38]
Activision Blizzard released a new title, Destiny, on September 9, 2014. The game made over $500 million in retail sales on the first day of release, setting a record for the biggest first day launch of a new gaming franchise.[19] On November 5, 2013, the company released Call of Duty: Ghosts, which was written by screenwriter Stephen Gaghan.[39] On its first release day the game sold $1 billion into retail.[19] In 2014, Activision Blizzard was the fifth largest gaming company by revenue worldwide,[40] with total assets of US $14.746 billion and total equity estimated at US $7.513 billion.[4]
S&P 500 and new divisions (2015–16)[edit]
Activision Blizzard joined the S&P 500 on August 28, 2015, becoming one of only three companies on the list related to gaming, alongside Microsoft and Electronic Arts.[7] The company released the next iteration of the Skylanders franchise in September 2015, which added vehicles to the "toys to life" category.[41] On September 15, 2015, Activision and Bungie released Destiny: The Taken King, the follow up to the Destiny saga. Two days later, Sony announced that the game broke the record for the most downloaded day-one game in PlayStation history, in terms of both total players and peak online concurrency.[42]
Activision Blizzard announced on November 2, 2015 that it would acquire social gaming company King, creator of the popular casual game Candy Crush Saga, for $5.9 billion.[14] At an Investor Day presentation on November 6, 2015, in the wake of the Warcraft feature film, Activision Blizzard announced the formation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a film production division dedicated to creating original television series and films. Headed by producer Stacey Sher and former The Walt Disney Company executive Nick van Dyk, Activision Blizzard Studios would look to produce an animated television series based on Skylanders called Skylanders Academy and films based on the Call of Duty franchise,[13] and partner with Legendary Pictures on possible sequels to the Warcraft movie.
Activision Blizzard owns the Call of Duty and Starcraft franchises, both of which have been popular as esports.[11][43] On October 21, 2015, Activision Blizzard announced the upcoming establishment of a new e-sports division.[12] Named Activision Blizzard Media Networks, the division is led by sports executive Steve Bornstein and Major League Gaming (MLG) co-founder Mike Sepso, with assets from the acquisition of the now defunct IGN Pro League. Bornstein was appointed the new division's chairman.[11][43] On December 31, 2015, it was reported that "substantially all" of Major League Gaming's assets would be acquired by Activision Blizzard.[11][43] The New York Times reported that the acquisition was intended to bolster Activision Blizzard's push into e-sports, as well as its plan to develop an e-sports cable channel.[44] Reports indicated that MLG would be shuttered, and that the majority of the purchase price would go towards paying off the company's debt.[11][43] Activision Blizzard acquired MLG on January 4, 2016[44] for $46 million.[11][43] In November 2016, it announced the Overwatch League.

In 2009, Business Insider reported that Worlds.com was claiming it owned the patent to "the idea of a scalable virtual world with thousands of users," with the company's CEO asserting that "he intends to sue anyone who refuses to enter into licensing negotiations - including giants such as Second Life and World of Warcraft.[58] On March 30, 2012, Worlds Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Massachusetts Federal Court alleging Activision Blizzard had infringed on two patents involving 3-D virtual environments.[59] The lawsuit focused on the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises,[60] and during pre-trial oral arguments, Activision Blizzard lead counsel was quoted stating "billions were at stake."[61] Activision Publishing filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit in California on October 4, 2013,[59] asserting that Worlds, Inc. was using two Activision-owned patents in its Worlds Player software.[62]
In March 2014,[63] a Boston court ruled that Activision was not required to pay Worlds.com "for using talking avatars in popular online titles like World of Warcraft," with the judge clarifying that "the patents belonging to Worlds Inc. appear invalid because the inventions they describe already appeared in public before the patents were filed." Worlds Inc. was limited to only suing Activision Blizzard for "future acts of infringement." Indeed, the Patents themselves at that time were not deemed invalid, rather the Certificate of Correction issued by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trade Office) to cure a defect in the prosecution (filed after the Lawsuit started) required that the Federal Lawsuit be refiled in order to take advantage of the earlier patent priority date. Worlds opted to allow the case to move forward, preserving the timeline and eliminating Activision Blizzards opportunity to directly file a USPTO Patent and Appeal Board challenge. Activision had not exercised its right to file a USPTO appeal to challenge the patents in question during the 1 year statutory time period. In response, Worlds.com announced they would instead be pursuing the recent release Call of Duty: Ghosts for damages.[64] The Worlds, Inc. case against Blizzard Activision was heard on October 3, 2014, with results still unannounced by the end of the year.[65] On June 26, 2015, the Massachusetts courts released a ruling that clarified technical terms for the lawsuit.[66] On November 28, 2016, the United States Patent and Appeal Board ruled claims 5 and 7 valid on US Patent 7493558.[67] The challenge of the US Patent 7493558 was instituted by Bungie, Inc.,an Activision Blizzard game developer.[68]

History[edit]
Formation (2007–08)[edit]
In December 2007, Activision announced that the company and its assets would merge with fellow games developer and publisher Vivendi Games. At the time, Vivendi was best known as the holding company for the game studios Sierra Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in California. Bobby Kotick of Activision was announced as the new president and CEO, while René Penisson of Vivendi was appointed chairman.[21] The European Commission permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any antitrust issues in the merger deal.[22] On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.[23]
Vivendi was the majority shareholder, with a 52% stake in the company.[23][24] The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the NASDAQ stock market for a time under NASDAQ: ATVID, and subsequently as NASDAQ: ATVI. At this point, Jean-Bernard Levy replaced René Penisson as chairman of Activision Blizzard.[9] The merger made Activision Blizzard the parent company of Vivendi Games' former divisions.[25] While Blizzard retained its autonomy and corporate leadership in the merger, other Vivendi Games divisions such as Sierra ceased operation.[26] With the merger, Kotick was quoted stating if a Sierra product did not meet Activision's requirements, they "won't likely be retained."[26] However, a number of Sierra's games such as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon and Prototype were retained and are now published by Activision.[27]
New titles and sales records (2009–12)[edit]
Activision Blizzard does not publish games under its central name and instead uses its studios to publish games.[28] In early 2010, the independent studio Bungie entered into a 10-year publishing agreement with Activision Blizzard.[29][30] By the end of 2010, Activision Blizzard was the largest video games publisher in the world.[31] The 2011 release of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 grossed $400 million in the US and UK alone in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest entertainment launch of all time.[18] It was also the third consecutive year the Call of Duty series broke the biggest launch record; 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops grossed $360 million on day one; and 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 brought in $310 million.[15] Call of Duty: Black Ops III grossed $550 million in worldwide sales during its opening weekend in 2015, making it the biggest entertainment launch of the year.[16][17]
In 2011, Activision Blizzard debuted its Skylanders franchise,[20] which led to the press crediting the company with inventing and popularizing a new toys-to-life category.[20][32][33] The first release Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was nominated for two Toy Industry Association awards in 2011: "Game of the Year" and "Innovative Toy of the Year".[34] Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and its sequels were released for major consoles and PC, and many were released on mobile devices as well.[20]
Split from Vivendi and growth (2013–14)[edit]




Activision Blizzard at Gamescon 2013, where the company exhibited 2013 titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Skylanders: Swap Force.


On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September.[35] At the conclusion of the deal, Vivendi was no longer Activision Blizzard's parent company,[36] and Activision Blizzard became an independent company as a majority of the shares became owned by the public. Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly retained a 24.4% stake in the company overall. In addition, Kotick remained the president and CEO, with Brian Kelly taking over as chairman.[35] On October 12, 2013, shortly after approval from the Delaware Supreme Court, the company completed the buyback, along the lines of the original plan.[37] Vivendi sold half its remaining stake on May 22, 2014, reducing its ownership to 5.8%.[38]
Activision Blizzard released a new title, Destiny, on September 9, 2014. The game made over $500 million in retail sales on the first day of release, setting a record for the biggest first day launch of a new gaming franchise.[19] On November 5, 2013, the company released Call of Duty: Ghosts, which was written by screenwriter Stephen Gaghan.[39] On its first release day the game sold $1 billion into retail.[19] In 2014, Activision Blizzard was the fifth largest gaming company by revenue worldwide,[40] with total assets of US $14.746 billion and total equity estimated at US $7.513 billion.[4]
S&P 500 and new divisions (2015–16)[edit]
Activision Blizzard joined the S&P 500 on August 28, 2015, becoming one of only three companies on the list related to gaming, alongside Microsoft and Electronic Arts.[7] The company released the next iteration of the Skylanders franchise in September 2015, which added vehicles to the "toys to life" category.[41] On September 15, 2015, Activision and Bungie released Destiny: The Taken King, the follow up to the Destiny saga. Two days later, Sony announced that the game broke the record for the most downloaded day-one game in PlayStation history, in terms of both total players and peak online concurrency.[42]
Activision Blizzard announced on November 2, 2015 that it would acquire social gaming company King, creator of the popular casual game Candy Crush Saga, for $5.9 billion.[14] At an Investor Day presentation on November 6, 2015, in the wake of the Warcraft feature film, Activision Blizzard announced the formation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a film production division dedicated to creating original television series and films. Headed by producer Stacey Sher and former The Walt Disney Company executive Nick van Dyk, Activision Blizzard Studios would look to produce an animated television series based on Skylanders called Skylanders Academy and films based on the Call of Duty franchise,[13] and partner with Legendary Pictures on possible sequels to the Warcraft movie.
Activision Blizzard owns the Call of Duty and Starcraft franchises, both of which have been popular as esports.[11][43] On October 21, 2015, Activision Blizzard announced the upcoming establishment of a new e-sports division.[12] Named Activision Blizzard Media Networks, the division is led by sports executive Steve Bornstein and Major League Gaming (MLG) co-founder Mike Sepso, with assets from the acquisition of the now defunct IGN Pro League. Bornstein was appointed the new division's chairman.[11][43] On December 31, 2015, it was reported that "substantially all" of Major League Gaming's assets would be acquired by Activision Blizzard.[11][43] The New York Times reported that the acquisition was intended to bolster Activision Blizzard's push into e-sports, as well as its plan to develop an e-sports cable channel.[44] Reports indicated that MLG would be shuttered, and that the majority of the purchase price would go towards paying off the company's debt.[11][43] Activision Blizzard acquired MLG on January 4, 2016[44] for $46 million.[11][43] In November 2016, it announced the Overwatch League.

In 2009, Business Insider reported that Worlds.com was claiming it owned the patent to "the idea of a scalable virtual world with thousands of users," with the company's CEO asserting that "he intends to sue anyone who refuses to enter into licensing negotiations - including giants such as Second Life and World of Warcraft.[58] On March 30, 2012, Worlds Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Massachusetts Federal Court alleging Activision Blizzard had infringed on two patents involving 3-D virtual environments.[59] The lawsuit focused on the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises,[60] and during pre-trial oral arguments, Activision Blizzard lead counsel was quoted stating "billions were at stake."[61] Activision Publishing filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit in California on October 4, 2013,[59] asserting that Worlds, Inc. was using two Activision-owned patents in its Worlds Player software.[62]
In March 2014,[63] a Boston court ruled that Activision was not required to pay Worlds.com "for using talking avatars in popular online titles like World of Warcraft," with the judge clarifying that "the patents belonging to Worlds Inc. appear invalid because the inventions they describe already appeared in public before the patents were filed." Worlds Inc. was limited to only suing Activision Blizzard for "future acts of infringement." Indeed, the Patents themselves at that time were not deemed invalid, rather the Certificate of Correction issued by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trade Office) to cure a defect in the prosecution (filed after the Lawsuit started) required that the Federal Lawsuit be refiled in order to take advantage of the earlier patent priority date. Worlds opted to allow the case to move forward, preserving the timeline and eliminating Activision Blizzards opportunity to directly file a USPTO Patent and Appeal Board challenge. Activision had not exercised its right to file a USPTO appeal to challenge the patents in question during the 1 year statutory time period. In response, Worlds.com announced they would instead be pursuing the recent release Call of Duty: Ghosts for damages.[64] The Worlds, Inc. case against Blizzard Activision was heard on October 3, 2014, with results still unannounced by the end of the year.[65] On June 26, 2015, the Massachusetts courts released a ruling that clarified technical terms for the lawsuit.[66] On November 28, 2016, the United States Patent and Appeal Board ruled claims 5 and 7 valid on US Patent 7493558.[67] The challenge of the US Patent 7493558 was instituted by Bungie, Inc.,an Activision Blizzard game developer.[68]

History[edit]
Formation (2007–08)[edit]
In December 2007, Activision announced that the company and its assets would merge with fellow games developer and publisher Vivendi Games. At the time, Vivendi was best known as the holding company for the game studios Sierra Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in California. Bobby Kotick of Activision was announced as the new president and CEO, while René Penisson of Vivendi was appointed chairman.[21] The European Commission permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any antitrust issues in the merger deal.[22] On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.[23]
Vivendi was the majority shareholder, with a 52% stake in the company.[23][24] The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the NASDAQ stock market for a time under NASDAQ: ATVID, and subsequently as NASDAQ: ATVI. At this point, Jean-Bernard Levy replaced René Penisson as chairman of Activision Blizzard.[9] The merger made Activision Blizzard the parent company of Vivendi Games' former divisions.[25] While Blizzard retained its autonomy and corporate leadership in the merger, other Vivendi Games divisions such as Sierra ceased operation.[26] With the merger, Kotick was quoted stating if a Sierra product did not meet Activision's requirements, they "won't likely be retained."[26] However, a number of Sierra's games such as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon and Prototype were retained and are now published by Activision.[27]
New titles and sales records (2009–12)[edit]
Activision Blizzard does not publish games under its central name and instead uses its studios to publish games.[28] In early 2010, the independent studio Bungie entered into a 10-year publishing agreement with Activision Blizzard.[29][30] By the end of 2010, Activision Blizzard was the largest video games publisher in the world.[31] The 2011 release of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 grossed $400 million in the US and UK alone in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest entertainment launch of all time.[18] It was also the third consecutive year the Call of Duty series broke the biggest launch record; 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops grossed $360 million on day one; and 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 brought in $310 million.[15] Call of Duty: Black Ops III grossed $550 million in worldwide sales during its opening weekend in 2015, making it the biggest entertainment launch of the year.[16][17]
In 2011, Activision Blizzard debuted its Skylanders franchise,[20] which led to the press crediting the company with inventing and popularizing a new toys-to-life category.[20][32][33] The first release Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was nominated for two Toy Industry Association awards in 2011: "Game of the Year" and "Innovative Toy of the Year".[34] Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and its sequels were released for major consoles and PC, and many were released on mobile devices as well.[20]
Split from Vivendi and growth (2013–14)[edit]




Activision Blizzard at Gamescon 2013, where the company exhibited 2013 titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Skylanders: Swap Force.


On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September.[35] At the conclusion of the deal, Vivendi was no longer Activision Blizzard's parent company,[36] and Activision Blizzard became an independent company as a majority of the shares became owned by the public. Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly retained a 24.4% stake in the company overall. In addition, Kotick remained the president and CEO, with Brian Kelly taking over as chairman.[35] On October 12, 2013, shortly after approval from the Delaware Supreme Court, the company completed the buyback, along the lines of the original plan.[37] Vivendi sold half its remaining stake on May 22, 2014, reducing its ownership to 5.8%.[38]
Activision Blizzard released a new title, Destiny, on September 9, 2014. The game made over $500 million in retail sales on the first day of release, setting a record for the biggest first day launch of a new gaming franchise.[19] On November 5, 2013, the company released Call of Duty: Ghosts, which was written by screenwriter Stephen Gaghan.[39] On its first release day the game sold $1 billion into retail.[19] In 2014, Activision Blizzard was the fifth largest gaming company by revenue worldwide,[40] with total assets of US $14.746 billion and total equity estimated at US $7.513 billion.[4]
S&P 500 and new divisions (2015–16)[edit]
Activision Blizzard joined the S&P 500 on August 28, 2015, becoming one of only three companies on the list related to gaming, alongside Microsoft and Electronic Arts.[7] The company released the next iteration of the Skylanders franchise in September 2015, which added vehicles to the "toys to life" category.[41] On September 15, 2015, Activision and Bungie released Destiny: The Taken King, the follow up to the Destiny saga. Two days later, Sony announced that the game broke the record for the most downloaded day-one game in PlayStation history, in terms of both total players and peak online concurrency.[42]
Activision Blizzard announced on November 2, 2015 that it would acquire social gaming company King, creator of the popular casual game Candy Crush Saga, for $5.9 billion.[14] At an Investor Day presentation on November 6, 2015, in the wake of the Warcraft feature film, Activision Blizzard announced the formation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a film production division dedicated to creating original television series and films. Headed by producer Stacey Sher and former The Walt Disney Company executive Nick van Dyk, Activision Blizzard Studios would look to produce an animated television series based on Skylanders called Skylanders Academy and films based on the Call of Duty franchise,[13] and partner with Legendary Pictures on possible sequels to the Warcraft movie.
Activision Blizzard owns the Call of Duty and Starcraft franchises, both of which have been popular as esports.[11][43] On October 21, 2015, Activision Blizzard announced the upcoming establishment of a new e-sports division.[12] Named Activision Blizzard Media Networks, the division is led by sports executive Steve Bornstein and Major League Gaming (MLG) co-founder Mike Sepso, with assets from the acquisition of the now defunct IGN Pro League. Bornstein was appointed the new division's chairman.[11][43] On December 31, 2015, it was reported that "substantially all" of Major League Gaming's assets would be acquired by Activision Blizzard.[11][43] The New York Times reported that the acquisition was intended to bolster Activision Blizzard's push into e-sports, as well as its plan to develop an e-sports cable channel.[44] Reports indicated that MLG would be shuttered, and that the majority of the purchase price would go towards paying off the company's debt.[11][43] Activision Blizzard acquired MLG on January 4, 2016[44] for $46 million.[11][43] In November 2016, it announced the Overwatch League.

In 2009, Business Insider reported that Worlds.com was claiming it owned the patent to "the idea of a scalable virtual world with thousands of users," with the company's CEO asserting that "he intends to sue anyone who refuses to enter into licensing negotiations - including giants such as Second Life and World of Warcraft.[58] On March 30, 2012, Worlds Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Massachusetts Federal Court alleging Activision Blizzard had infringed on two patents involving 3-D virtual environments.[59] The lawsuit focused on the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises,[60] and during pre-trial oral arguments, Activision Blizzard lead counsel was quoted stating "billions were at stake."[61] Activision Publishing filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit in California on October 4, 2013,[59] asserting that Worlds, Inc. was using two Activision-owned patents in its Worlds Player software.[62]
In March 2014,[63] a Boston court ruled that Activision was not required to pay Worlds.com "for using talking avatars in popular online titles like World of Warcraft," with the judge clarifying that "the patents belonging to Worlds Inc. appear invalid because the inventions they describe already appeared in public before the patents were filed." Worlds Inc. was limited to only suing Activision Blizzard for "future acts of infringement." Indeed, the Patents themselves at that time were not deemed invalid, rather the Certificate of Correction issued by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trade Office) to cure a defect in the prosecution (filed after the Lawsuit started) required that the Federal Lawsuit be refiled in order to take advantage of the earlier patent priority date. Worlds opted to allow the case to move forward, preserving the timeline and eliminating Activision Blizzards opportunity to directly file a USPTO Patent and Appeal Board challenge. Activision had not exercised its right to file a USPTO appeal to challenge the patents in question during the 1 year statutory time period. In response, Worlds.com announced they would instead be pursuing the recent release Call of Duty: Ghosts for damages.[64] The Worlds, Inc. case against Blizzard Activision was heard on October 3, 2014, with results still unannounced by the end of the year.[65] On June 26, 2015, the Massachusetts courts released a ruling that clarified technical terms for the lawsuit.[66] On November 28, 2016, the United States Patent and Appeal Board ruled claims 5 and 7 valid on US Patent 7493558.[67] The challenge of the US Patent 7493558 was instituted by Bungie, Inc.,an Activision Blizzard game developer.[68]

Names Veteran Mattel and Disney Executive Tim Kilpin Division CEO

      and President

 SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATVI) today announced the launch of a

      newly created Consumer Products division and the appointment of veteran

      Mattel and Disney executive Tim Kilpin as its CEO and president. The new

      division will further accelerate Activision Blizzard's global growth

      strategy by leveraging its iconic content and creating new ways for

      audiences to connect with the Company's franchises and characters.

    


      "Inspiring play, competition, and community underpins everything we do,

      and giving audiences new ways to experience our franchises is core to

      this commitment," said Activision Blizzard Chief Executive Officer Bobby

      Kotick. "Under Tim's leadership, we will elevate our consumer product

      offerings to the same level of exceptional quality as our games and

      transform the ways audiences connect with the characters they love in

      their everyday lives."

    


      The launch of the new Consumer Products division is another strategic

      pillar in Activision Blizzard's expansion of the platforms through which

      it offers its compelling franchises to audiences, including interactive

      content, television and film, competitive gaming and mobile.

    


      "Activision Blizzard is a global entertainment powerhouse, and its

      combination of iconic franchises and massive audience reach offers

      incredible opportunities for retailers and partners," said Kilpin. "I'm

      excited to lead this newly-formed division and join Activision

      Blizzard's already incredibly talented consumer products team in

      delivering powerful new partnerships and even more touchpoints to

      audiences."

    


      In his new role, Kilpin will lead the development of innovative consumer

      products to expand and deepen audience engagement with Activision

      Blizzard's iconic franchises through long-term retail partnerships,

      high-quality products and all new consumer experiences. Activision

      Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment and King Digital's talented consumer

      product teams will join Kilpin in the new division.

    


      Most recently, Kilpin served as Mattel's president and chief commercial

      officer, overseeing the company's sales and marketing functions across

      all regions. Previously, he served as executive vice president for

      Mattel's Boys and Girls Division, leading global brand strategy,

      marketing, product design and development, consumer products and content

      development for the company's iconic brands, including Barbie, Hot

      Wheels and Monster High. Prior to that, Kilpin was executive vice

      president of franchise management for The Walt Disney Company, where he

      oversaw global cross-category franchise plans for Disney Princess,

      Winnie the Pooh, Mickey Mouse and Pixar properties.

Activision Blizzard Inc. Stock at $50: What's Next?
A look at the bullish and bearish cases for the video game giant's business.











                Demitrios Kalogeropoulos
            

                (TMFSigma)



            
            Mar 31, 2017 at 9:39AM
            
            





Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) stock recently passed the $50 mark for the first time. That figure equates to a pricey 39 times the $966 million of profit that the video game giant booked in the past year. Rival Electronic Arts, meanwhile, is valued at 22 times trailing earnings.
Investors are excited about Activision's future, given the developer's deep portfolio of intellectual property that now spans the full gaming range from high-profile franchises like Call of Duty to hit mobile products such as Candy Crush. But should they be this excited?

The case for more growth
It's hard to overstate the strength of the fiscal year that Activision just closed. Revenue spiked higher by 42% as the company launched another hit global property in Overwatch, logged solid gains in older franchises Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, and extended its reach deeper into casual gaming with the purchase of King Digital.
Through each of these major initiatives, player engagement marched higher and the online sales channel grew in importance. As a result, the developer enjoyed record profit margins as digital revenue spiked by 74% to account for over half of all sales.
Activision has also succeeded at transitioning its biggest franchises from launch-driven revenue flashes to year-round businesses. In other words, its properties are becoming both more valuable and longer-lived.
Finally, the company's opportunities extend outside of the core video game segment since many of its properties are global entertainment brands. It makes sense, then, for Activision to target licensing revenue by diversifying into consumer products and advertising sales by pushing into areas like e-Sports. Spectators dedicated 43 billion hours watching its games in the last year, or about as much time as Netflix's user base spent streaming its TV content.
The case for caution
For now, at least, Activision is mainly a video game company. And so it is exposed to general industry slowdowns, disruptions that always occur ahead of next-generation console roll-outs, and a potential misfire in a big brand. While the business has come a long way since 2013 when just three franchises accounted for nearly all its profits, a bungled release for, say Destiny or Call of Duty this year could halt its momentum.

Mobile gaming also presents a key risk to the business. Early attempts to monetize King Digital's massive player base through advertising have been encouraging, but these casual gamers could quickly lose interest if Activision pushes this plan too far.
There's likely not a lot of room to boost both engagement and profitability in this segment. Investors are betting that Activision can significantly improve the economics of these casual games, but there's no guarantee the company can keep hold of King Digital's 400 million players, let alone convince them to shell out for microtransactions or stick around through extra advertising pauses.
Finally, there's the danger that management gets distracted by attractive but unproven growth initiatives like consumer products and movie and TV licensing. Diversifying into a media entertainment giant that looks more like Disney has its benefits, but so does a sharp focus on the video game properties that got Activision to its current $38 billion market capitalization.





What's ahead for Activision?
Investors can keep a close eye on core engagement metrics over the next few years as a check on whether the company is straying too far from its roots. As for the stock, its premium valuation makes sense so long as Activision's growth sets the pace for the industry even as the business becomes more stable and profitable. The good news for shareholders is that, despite the risks, gaming trends, both inside and outside of the company's control, seem to support that optimistic reading.

"Skylanders Academy" Netflix Television Series Committed for Season 3

      in 2018

 LAS VEGAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Activision Blizzard unleashes its franchises of the future at Licensing

      Expo 2017 - showcasing a slate of 360-degree entertainment properties

      that will drive its global licensing and retail business in 2017 and

      beyond. The newly formed Activision Blizzard Consumer Products Group

      makes its debut at the Expo to leverage the iconic, blockbuster

      franchises from across the company, including: Call of Duty®,

      Skylanders® and Bungie's Destiny from Activision; Overwatch®,

      Hearthstone® and World of Warcraft® from Blizzard

      Entertainment; and Candy Crush™ from King. With a massive

      audience reach, the company's tentpole properties offer opportunities

      across gameplay, linear storytelling, esports and consumer products.

    


      "Activision Blizzard has evolved from launching videogames to building

      long-lasting, trans-media entertainment franchises that drive

      engagement. The recently formed Activision Blizzard Consumer Products

      Group is poised to leverage our powerhouses such as Blizzard's Overwatch

      and Activision's Call of Duty in new ways, especially as our

      esports business continues to grow," said Tim Kilpin, CEO and president,

      Activision Blizzard Consumer Products Group. "We're looking to give our

      fans new ways to play, display, wear and live the brands they love."

    


      Building on the success of existing consumer products businesses, the

      new Activision Blizzard Consumer Products Group will provide more

      strength at retail and generate more engagement opportunities for the

      company's community of 430 million players in 196 countries who spent 40

      billion hours playing its games last year. The division is passionate

      about working with best-in-class partners to create high quality and

      deeply relevant merchandise for their global gaming audience based on

      its beloved franchises.

    


      Details of Activision Blizzard Consumer Products Group's line-up of

      marquee entertainment properties follows:

    

Activision



      A leading global producer and publisher of interactive entertainment,

      Activision is home to a powerful portfolio of properties, including Call

      of Duty, Bungie's Destiny, Skylanders and the retro

      ‘90s Crash Bandicoot™.

    


      With more than $15 billion in franchise revenue since inception1,

      the pop culture phenomenon Call of Duty is one of the

      biggest videogame franchises of all time. Activision recently revealed Call

      of Duty®: WWII, scheduled for release on November 3, a game that

      defines World War 2 for a new gaming generation. Further, players will

      compete for a $4 million total prize pool during this season's Call of

      Duty World League, a premier esports series. Additionally, a Call of

      Duty film franchise is in development. Supported by a merchandising

      program that lives beyond annual game title releases 365 days a year, Call

      Editions (Field Manual), DGL Group (Drones), Astro Gaming (Headsets),

      Mattel (Collectible Construction Sets) and Otterbox (Mobile and iPad

      cases), among many others.

    


      Bungie's Destiny is supported by a global community of

      passionate fans who have played more than 3 billion hours, life-to-date. Destiny

      continues to be one of the most engaging videogames and has become the

      #1 most-watched console-only game on Twitch by minutes watched for the

      second year in a row. And now, for the first time ever, Destiny 2

      will be available on PC at retail and as the first third-party game to

      be offered digitally via Battle.net®, Blizzard Entertainment's online

      gaming service. In celebration of the Destiny 2 launch on

      September 8, Bungie, in collaboration with Activision, aims to expand

      the adventure through new and existing licensees, including: Bioworld

      (Apparel and Accessories), McFarlane Toys (Action Figures), Mattel

      (Construction Sets), Funko (Vinyl Figures), Razer (Gaming Accessories),

      RockLove (Jewelry), Concept One (Headwear and Accessories), Insight

      Editions (Art Book, Journals), USAopoly (Puzzles and Playing Cards) and

      KontrolFreek (Gaming Controller Accessories).

    


      Rounding out Activision's portfolio is the award-winning, $3.5 billion Skylanders

      franchise. Based on the debut success of the "Skylanders™ Academy"

      animated television show, Netflix has ordered a third season for 2018,

      with the second season planned for later in 2017. Skylanders

      continues to be supported by a roster of best-in-class partners.

      back, enhanced and ready to dance in the Crash Bandicoot™ N. Sane

      Trilogy coming in June. The game is supported by a merchandising

      program appealing to fans of the nostalgic ‘90s game, including: Changes

      (Apparel), Concept One (Accessories), Rubber Road (Apparel, Accessories,

      Mugs, Home Décor) and Venture Classics (Collectible Figures).

    

Blizzard Entertainment


Blizzard Entertainment, a premier award-winning game developer and

      publisher, is home to some of the world's most passionate fans who are

      deeply engaged with blockbuster games like World of Warcraft, Hearthstone,

      Diablo® III, StarCraft® II, Heroes of the Storm® and Overwatch,

      Blizzard's internationally acclaimed team-based shooter.

    


      Celebrating its first anniversary on May 23, Overwatch has won

      more than 100 Game of the Year awards and reached more than 30 million

      players globally. Overwatch's wide appeal stems from the game's

      vibrant and optimistic vision of a near-future Earth, its diverse cast

      of heroes and its exciting objective-and-team-based action. In addition, Overwatch

      represents a next-generation esports experience, with an upcoming

      competitive league that will feature professional franchises tied to

      major cities. In an effort to provide Overwatch players with even

      more opportunities to showcase their passion for the game and its

      community, Activision Blizzard Consumer Products Group is looking to

      expand the merchandising program to create additional touchpoints.

    


      The iconic massively multiplayer online role playing game World of

      Warcraft has engaged more than 100 million passionate players in

      a rich, ever-evolving online adventure that has spanned more than a

      decade. Its latest expansion, World of Warcraft: Legion™, is one

      of the fastest-selling PC games of all time. World of Warcraft

      players around the world share a passion for the characters and stories

      of the Warcraft universe, which serves as the foundation for

      multiple games and other trans-media products. Last summer they saw some

      of their favorite heroes and villains brought to life on the big screen

      in the Warcraft movie, which became the highest-grossing

      videogame film adaptation of all time.

    


      Blizzard games are supported by a tailored merchandising program

      designed to extend fans' experiences far beyond the games themselves.

      Licensees include Good Smile (Figures), J!nx (Apparel), Dark Horse

      (Publishing), Insight Editions (Cookbook) and Tokidoki (Apparel,

      Accessories). Blizzard developers, including artists and designers, work

      closely with licensees as part of Blizzard's commitment to creating

      high-quality products that fans will love.

    

King



      King, a leading interactive entertainment company for the mobile world,

      supports an active community of hundreds of millions of players with Candy

      Crush Saga, one of the world's most popular mobile games, along with

      its sister titles, Candy Crush Soda Saga and Candy Crush Jelly

      Saga. Designed for adults, the Candy Crush brand and its

      merchandising program brings to life a fun, magical world in which

      players must match colorful candies in combinations of three or more to

      win points, defeat obstacles and progress through more than 2,000 levels.

    


      With candies at the center of the licensing program, the food-related

      category - including Confectionary, Chocolate and Ice Cream - is one of

      the most successful categories for Candy Crush licensing. Another

      leading category is Publishing, having launched a Candy Crush Tips

      and Tricks book, two adult-only coloring books and a Candy Crush

      Cakes & Bakes book. This summer, fans will enjoy seeing the

      live-action television game show hosted by Mario Lopez on CBS prime-time.

    


      The award-winning Candy Crush property is supported by partners

      including: Amber House (Health & Beauty), Ascania (Soda Drinks), BakedIn

      (Bake at home kits), InPhase (Air Fresheners), Rossi (Ice Cream), Tubz

      (Candy), Little Brown (Publishing) and Winning Moves (Board Games). King

      is dedicated to supporting its licensees through far-reaching,

      integrated marketing initiatives, including event-based activities,

      partnerships, public relations and social campaigns. This includes

      leveraging the massive Candy Crush franchise social media

      following of more than 80 million fans on Facebook.

    

Activision Blizzard Consumer Products Group can be found at the

      Licensing Expo in Booth U-202, where some of the company's newest

      games will be available to play. The focus for the show includes seeking

      new partners across multiple categories for Overwatch; expanding

      the lifestyle merchandising program for Call of Duty; and in

      partnership with Bungie, leveraging the intense excitement for this

      year's Destiny 2 launch.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Formation (2007–08)[edit]
In December 2007, Activision announced that the company and its assets would merge with fellow games developer and publisher Vivendi Games. At the time, Vivendi was best known as the holding company for the game studios Sierra Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in California. Bobby Kotick of Activision was announced as the new president and CEO, while René Penisson of Vivendi was appointed chairman.[21] The European Commission permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any antitrust issues in the merger deal.[22] On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.[23]
Vivendi was the majority shareholder, with a 52% stake in the company.[23][24] The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the NASDAQ stock market for a time under NASDAQ: ATVID, and subsequently as NASDAQ: ATVI. At this point, Jean-Bernard Levy replaced René Penisson as chairman of Activision Blizzard.[9] The merger made Activision Blizzard the parent company of Vivendi Games' former divisions.[25] While Blizzard retained its autonomy and corporate leadership in the merger, other Vivendi Games divisions such as Sierra ceased operation.[26] With the merger, Kotick was quoted stating if a Sierra product did not meet Activision's requirements, they "won't likely be retained."[26] However, a number of Sierra's games such as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon and Prototype were retained and are now published by Activision.[27]
New titles and sales records (2009–12)[edit]
Activision Blizzard does not publish games under its central name and instead uses its studios to publish games.[28] In early 2010, the independent studio Bungie entered into a 10-year publishing agreement with Activision Blizzard.[29][30] By the end of 2010, Activision Blizzard was the largest video games publisher in the world.[31] The 2011 release of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 grossed $400 million in the US and UK alone in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest entertainment launch of all time.[18] It was also the third consecutive year the Call of Duty series broke the biggest launch record; 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops grossed $360 million on day one; and 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 brought in $310 million.[15] Call of Duty: Black Ops III grossed $550 million in worldwide sales during its opening weekend in 2015, making it the biggest entertainment launch of the year.[16][17]
In 2011, Activision Blizzard debuted its Skylanders franchise,[20] which led to the press crediting the company with inventing and popularizing a new toys-to-life category.[20][32][33] The first release Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was nominated for two Toy Industry Association awards in 2011: "Game of the Year" and "Innovative Toy of the Year".[34] Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and its sequels were released for major consoles and PC, and many were released on mobile devices as well.[20]
Split from Vivendi and growth (2013–14)[edit]




Activision Blizzard at Gamescon 2013, where the company exhibited 2013 titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Skylanders: Swap Force.


On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September.[35] At the conclusion of the deal, Vivendi was no longer Activision Blizzard's parent company,[36] and Activision Blizzard became an independent company as a majority of the shares became owned by the public. Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly retained a 24.4% stake in the company overall. In addition, Kotick remained the president and CEO, with Brian Kelly taking over as chairman.[35] On October 12, 2013, shortly after approval from the Delaware Supreme Court, the company completed the buyback, along the lines of the original plan.[37] Vivendi sold half its remaining stake on May 22, 2014, reducing its ownership to 5.8%.[38]
Activision Blizzard released a new title, Destiny, on September 9, 2014. The game made over $500 million in retail sales on the first day of release, setting a record for the biggest first day launch of a new gaming franchise.[19] On November 5, 2013, the company released Call of Duty: Ghosts, which was written by screenwriter Stephen Gaghan.[39] On its first release day the game sold $1 billion into retail.[19] In 2014, Activision Blizzard was the fifth largest gaming company by revenue worldwide,[40] with total assets of US $14.746 billion and total equity estimated at US $7.513 billion.[4]
S&P 500 and new divisions (2015–16)[edit]
Activision Blizzard joined the S&P 500 on August 28, 2015, becoming one of only three companies on the list related to gaming, alongside Microsoft and Electronic Arts.[7] The company released the next iteration of the Skylanders franchise in September 2015, which added vehicles to the "toys to life" category.[41] On September 15, 2015, Activision and Bungie released Destiny: The Taken King, the follow up to the Destiny saga. Two days later, Sony announced that the game broke the record for the most downloaded day-one game in PlayStation history, in terms of both total players and peak online concurrency.[42]
Activision Blizzard announced on November 2, 2015 that it would acquire social gaming company King, creator of the popular casual game Candy Crush Saga, for $5.9 billion.[14] At an Investor Day presentation on November 6, 2015, in the wake of the Warcraft feature film, Activision Blizzard announced the formation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a film production division dedicated to creating original television series and films. Headed by producer Stacey Sher and former The Walt Disney Company executive Nick van Dyk, Activision Blizzard Studios would look to produce an animated television series based on Skylanders called Skylanders Academy and films based on the Call of Duty franchise,[13] and partner with Legendary Pictures on possible sequels to the Warcraft movie.
Activision Blizzard owns the Call of Duty and Starcraft franchises, both of which have been popular as esports.[11][43] On October 21, 2015, Activision Blizzard announced the upcoming establishment of a new e-sports division.[12] Named Activision Blizzard Media Networks, the division is led by sports executive Steve Bornstein and Major League Gaming (MLG) co-founder Mike Sepso, with assets from the acquisition of the now defunct IGN Pro League. Bornstein was appointed the new division's chairman.[11][43] On December 31, 2015, it was reported that "substantially all" of Major League Gaming's assets would be acquired by Activision Blizzard.[11][43] The New York Times reported that the acquisition was intended to bolster Activision Blizzard's push into e-sports, as well as its plan to develop an e-sports cable channel.[44] Reports indicated that MLG would be shuttered, and that the majority of the purchase price would go towards paying off the company's debt.[11][43] Activision Blizzard acquired MLG on January 4, 2016[44] for $46 million.[11][43] In November 2016, it announced the Overwatch League.

In 2009, Business Insider reported that Worlds.com was claiming it owned the patent to "the idea of a scalable virtual world with thousands of users," with the company's CEO asserting that "he intends to sue anyone who refuses to enter into licensing negotiations - including giants such as Second Life and World of Warcraft.[58] On March 30, 2012, Worlds Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Massachusetts Federal Court alleging Activision Blizzard had infringed on two patents involving 3-D virtual environments.[59] The lawsuit focused on the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises,[60] and during pre-trial oral arguments, Activision Blizzard lead counsel was quoted stating "billions were at stake."[61] Activision Publishing filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit in California on October 4, 2013,[59] asserting that Worlds, Inc. was using two Activision-owned patents in its Worlds Player software.[62]
In March 2014,[63] a Boston court ruled that Activision was not required to pay Worlds.com "for using talking avatars in popular online titles like World of Warcraft," with the judge clarifying that "the patents belonging to Worlds Inc. appear invalid because the inventions they describe already appeared in public before the patents were filed." Worlds Inc. was limited to only suing Activision Blizzard for "future acts of infringement." Indeed, the Patents themselves at that time were not deemed invalid, rather the Certificate of Correction issued by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trade Office) to cure a defect in the prosecution (filed after the Lawsuit started) required that the Federal Lawsuit be refiled in order to take advantage of the earlier patent priority date. Worlds opted to allow the case to move forward, preserving the timeline and eliminating Activision Blizzards opportunity to directly file a USPTO Patent and Appeal Board challenge. Activision had not exercised its right to file a USPTO appeal to challenge the patents in question during the 1 year statutory time period. In response, Worlds.com announced they would instead be pursuing the recent release Call of Duty: Ghosts for damages.[64] The Worlds, Inc. case against Blizzard Activision was heard on October 3, 2014, with results still unannounced by the end of the year.[65] On June 26, 2015, the Massachusetts courts released a ruling that clarified technical terms for the lawsuit.[66] On November 28, 2016, the United States Patent and Appeal Board ruled claims 5 and 7 valid on US Patent 7493558.[67] The challenge of the US Patent 7493558 was instituted by Bungie, Inc.,an Activision Blizzard game developer.[68]

History[edit]
Formation (2007–08)[edit]
In December 2007, Activision announced that the company and its assets would merge with fellow games developer and publisher Vivendi Games. At the time, Vivendi was best known as the holding company for the game studios Sierra Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in California. Bobby Kotick of Activision was announced as the new president and CEO, while René Penisson of Vivendi was appointed chairman.[21] The European Commission permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any antitrust issues in the merger deal.[22] On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.[23]
Vivendi was the majority shareholder, with a 52% stake in the company.[23][24] The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the NASDAQ stock market for a time under NASDAQ: ATVID, and subsequently as NASDAQ: ATVI. At this point, Jean-Bernard Levy replaced René Penisson as chairman of Activision Blizzard.[9] The merger made Activision Blizzard the parent company of Vivendi Games' former divisions.[25] While Blizzard retained its autonomy and corporate leadership in the merger, other Vivendi Games divisions such as Sierra ceased operation.[26] With the merger, Kotick was quoted stating if a Sierra product did not meet Activision's requirements, they "won't likely be retained."[26] However, a number of Sierra's games such as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon and Prototype were retained and are now published by Activision.[27]
New titles and sales records (2009–12)[edit]
Activision Blizzard does not publish games under its central name and instead uses its studios to publish games.[28] In early 2010, the independent studio Bungie entered into a 10-year publishing agreement with Activision Blizzard.[29][30] By the end of 2010, Activision Blizzard was the largest video games publisher in the world.[31] The 2011 release of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 grossed $400 million in the US and UK alone in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest entertainment launch of all time.[18] It was also the third consecutive year the Call of Duty series broke the biggest launch record; 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops grossed $360 million on day one; and 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 brought in $310 million.[15] Call of Duty: Black Ops III grossed $550 million in worldwide sales during its opening weekend in 2015, making it the biggest entertainment launch of the year.[16][17]
In 2011, Activision Blizzard debuted its Skylanders franchise,[20] which led to the press crediting the company with inventing and popularizing a new toys-to-life category.[20][32][33] The first release Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was nominated for two Toy Industry Association awards in 2011: "Game of the Year" and "Innovative Toy of the Year".[34] Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and its sequels were released for major consoles and PC, and many were released on mobile devices as well.[20]
Split from Vivendi and growth (2013–14)[edit]




Activision Blizzard at Gamescon 2013, where the company exhibited 2013 titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Skylanders: Swap Force.


On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September.[35] At the conclusion of the deal, Vivendi was no longer Activision Blizzard's parent company,[36] and Activision Blizzard became an independent company as a majority of the shares became owned by the public. Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly retained a 24.4% stake in the company overall. In addition, Kotick remained the president and CEO, with Brian Kelly taking over as chairman.[35] On October 12, 2013, shortly after approval from the Delaware Supreme Court, the company completed the buyback, along the lines of the original plan.[37] Vivendi sold half its remaining stake on May 22, 2014, reducing its ownership to 5.8%.[38]
Activision Blizzard released a new title, Destiny, on September 9, 2014. The game made over $500 million in retail sales on the first day of release, setting a record for the biggest first day launch of a new gaming franchise.[19] On November 5, 2013, the company released Call of Duty: Ghosts, which was written by screenwriter Stephen Gaghan.[39] On its first release day the game sold $1 billion into retail.[19] In 2014, Activision Blizzard was the fifth largest gaming company by revenue worldwide,[40] with total assets of US $14.746 billion and total equity estimated at US $7.513 billion.[4]
S&P 500 and new divisions (2015–16)[edit]
Activision Blizzard joined the S&P 500 on August 28, 2015, becoming one of only three companies on the list related to gaming, alongside Microsoft and Electronic Arts.[7] The company released the next iteration of the Skylanders franchise in September 2015, which added vehicles to the "toys to life" category.[41] On September 15, 2015, Activision and Bungie released Destiny: The Taken King, the follow up to the Destiny saga. Two days later, Sony announced that the game broke the record for the most downloaded day-one game in PlayStation history, in terms of both total players and peak online concurrency.[42]
Activision Blizzard announced on November 2, 2015 that it would acquire social gaming company King, creator of the popular casual game Candy Crush Saga, for $5.9 billion.[14] At an Investor Day presentation on November 6, 2015, in the wake of the Warcraft feature film, Activision Blizzard announced the formation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a film production division dedicated to creating original television series and films. Headed by producer Stacey Sher and former The Walt Disney Company executive Nick van Dyk, Activision Blizzard Studios would look to produce an animated television series based on Skylanders called Skylanders Academy and films based on the Call of Duty franchise,[13] and partner with Legendary Pictures on possible sequels to the Warcraft movie.
Activision Blizzard owns the Call of Duty and Starcraft franchises, both of which have been popular as esports.[11][43] On October 21, 2015, Activision Blizzard announced the upcoming establishment of a new e-sports division.[12] Named Activision Blizzard Media Networks, the division is led by sports executive Steve Bornstein and Major League Gaming (MLG) co-founder Mike Sepso, with assets from the acquisition of the now defunct IGN Pro League. Bornstein was appointed the new division's chairman.[11][43] On December 31, 2015, it was reported that "substantially all" of Major League Gaming's assets would be acquired by Activision Blizzard.[11][43] The New York Times reported that the acquisition was intended to bolster Activision Blizzard's push into e-sports, as well as its plan to develop an e-sports cable channel.[44] Reports indicated that MLG would be shuttered, and that the majority of the purchase price would go towards paying off the company's debt.[11][43] Activision Blizzard acquired MLG on January 4, 2016[44] for $46 million.[11][43] In November 2016, it announced the Overwatch League.

In 2009, Business Insider reported that Worlds.com was claiming it owned the patent to "the idea of a scalable virtual world with thousands of users," with the company's CEO asserting that "he intends to sue anyone who refuses to enter into licensing negotiations - including giants such as Second Life and World of Warcraft.[58] On March 30, 2012, Worlds Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Massachusetts Federal Court alleging Activision Blizzard had infringed on two patents involving 3-D virtual environments.[59] The lawsuit focused on the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises,[60] and during pre-trial oral arguments, Activision Blizzard lead counsel was quoted stating "billions were at stake."[61] Activision Publishing filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit in California on October 4, 2013,[59] asserting that Worlds, Inc. was using two Activision-owned patents in its Worlds Player software.[62]
In March 2014,[63] a Boston court ruled that Activision was not required to pay Worlds.com "for using talking avatars in popular online titles like World of Warcraft," with the judge clarifying that "the patents belonging to Worlds Inc. appear invalid because the inventions they describe already appeared in public before the patents were filed." Worlds Inc. was limited to only suing Activision Blizzard for "future acts of infringement." Indeed, the Patents themselves at that time were not deemed invalid, rather the Certificate of Correction issued by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trade Office) to cure a defect in the prosecution (filed after the Lawsuit started) required that the Federal Lawsuit be refiled in order to take advantage of the earlier patent priority date. Worlds opted to allow the case to move forward, preserving the timeline and eliminating Activision Blizzards opportunity to directly file a USPTO Patent and Appeal Board challenge. Activision had not exercised its right to file a USPTO appeal to challenge the patents in question during the 1 year statutory time period. In response, Worlds.com announced they would instead be pursuing the recent release Call of Duty: Ghosts for damages.[64] The Worlds, Inc. case against Blizzard Activision was heard on October 3, 2014, with results still unannounced by the end of the year.[65] On June 26, 2015, the Massachusetts courts released a ruling that clarified technical terms for the lawsuit.[66] On November 28, 2016, the United States Patent and Appeal Board ruled claims 5 and 7 valid on US Patent 7493558.[67] The challenge of the US Patent 7493558 was instituted by Bungie, Inc.,an Activision Blizzard game developer.[68]

History[edit]
Formation (2007–08)[edit]
In December 2007, Activision announced that the company and its assets would merge with fellow games developer and publisher Vivendi Games. At the time, Vivendi was best known as the holding company for the game studios Sierra Entertainment and Blizzard Entertainment. The new company was to be named Activision Blizzard, and would retain its central headquarters in California. Bobby Kotick of Activision was announced as the new president and CEO, while René Penisson of Vivendi was appointed chairman.[21] The European Commission permitted the merger to take place in April 2008, approving that there weren't any antitrust issues in the merger deal.[22] On July 8, 2008, Activision announced that stockholders had agreed to merge, and the deal closed the next day for an estimated transaction amount of US$18.9 billion.[23]
Vivendi was the majority shareholder, with a 52% stake in the company.[23][24] The rest of the shares were held by institutional and private investors, and were to be left open for trading on the NASDAQ stock market for a time under NASDAQ: ATVID, and subsequently as NASDAQ: ATVI. At this point, Jean-Bernard Levy replaced René Penisson as chairman of Activision Blizzard.[9] The merger made Activision Blizzard the parent company of Vivendi Games' former divisions.[25] While Blizzard retained its autonomy and corporate leadership in the merger, other Vivendi Games divisions such as Sierra ceased operation.[26] With the merger, Kotick was quoted stating if a Sierra product did not meet Activision's requirements, they "won't likely be retained."[26] However, a number of Sierra's games such as Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon and Prototype were retained and are now published by Activision.[27]
New titles and sales records (2009–12)[edit]
Activision Blizzard does not publish games under its central name and instead uses its studios to publish games.[28] In early 2010, the independent studio Bungie entered into a 10-year publishing agreement with Activision Blizzard.[29][30] By the end of 2010, Activision Blizzard was the largest video games publisher in the world.[31] The 2011 release of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 grossed $400 million in the US and UK alone in its first 24 hours, making it the biggest entertainment launch of all time.[18] It was also the third consecutive year the Call of Duty series broke the biggest launch record; 2010's Call of Duty: Black Ops grossed $360 million on day one; and 2009's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 brought in $310 million.[15] Call of Duty: Black Ops III grossed $550 million in worldwide sales during its opening weekend in 2015, making it the biggest entertainment launch of the year.[16][17]
In 2011, Activision Blizzard debuted its Skylanders franchise,[20] which led to the press crediting the company with inventing and popularizing a new toys-to-life category.[20][32][33] The first release Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure was nominated for two Toy Industry Association awards in 2011: "Game of the Year" and "Innovative Toy of the Year".[34] Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure and its sequels were released for major consoles and PC, and many were released on mobile devices as well.[20]
Split from Vivendi and growth (2013–14)[edit]




Activision Blizzard at Gamescon 2013, where the company exhibited 2013 titles such as Call of Duty: Ghosts and Skylanders: Swap Force.


On July 25, 2013, Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from owner Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September.[35] At the conclusion of the deal, Vivendi was no longer Activision Blizzard's parent company,[36] and Activision Blizzard became an independent company as a majority of the shares became owned by the public. Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly retained a 24.4% stake in the company overall. In addition, Kotick remained the president and CEO, with Brian Kelly taking over as chairman.[35] On October 12, 2013, shortly after approval from the Delaware Supreme Court, the company completed the buyback, along the lines of the original plan.[37] Vivendi sold half its remaining stake on May 22, 2014, reducing its ownership to 5.8%.[38]
Activision Blizzard released a new title, Destiny, on September 9, 2014. The game made over $500 million in retail sales on the first day of release, setting a record for the biggest first day launch of a new gaming franchise.[19] On November 5, 2013, the company released Call of Duty: Ghosts, which was written by screenwriter Stephen Gaghan.[39] On its first release day the game sold $1 billion into retail.[19] In 2014, Activision Blizzard was the fifth largest gaming company by revenue worldwide,[40] with total assets of US $14.746 billion and total equity estimated at US $7.513 billion.[4]
S&P 500 and new divisions (2015–16)[edit]
Activision Blizzard joined the S&P 500 on August 28, 2015, becoming one of only three companies on the list related to gaming, alongside Microsoft and Electronic Arts.[7] The company released the next iteration of the Skylanders franchise in September 2015, which added vehicles to the "toys to life" category.[41] On September 15, 2015, Activision and Bungie released Destiny: The Taken King, the follow up to the Destiny saga. Two days later, Sony announced that the game broke the record for the most downloaded day-one game in PlayStation history, in terms of both total players and peak online concurrency.[42]
Activision Blizzard announced on November 2, 2015 that it would acquire social gaming company King, creator of the popular casual game Candy Crush Saga, for $5.9 billion.[14] At an Investor Day presentation on November 6, 2015, in the wake of the Warcraft feature film, Activision Blizzard announced the formation of Activision Blizzard Studios, a film production division dedicated to creating original television series and films. Headed by producer Stacey Sher and former The Walt Disney Company executive Nick van Dyk, Activision Blizzard Studios would look to produce an animated television series based on Skylanders called Skylanders Academy and films based on the Call of Duty franchise,[13] and partner with Legendary Pictures on possible sequels to the Warcraft movie.
Activision Blizzard owns the Call of Duty and Starcraft franchises, both of which have been popular as esports.[11][43] On October 21, 2015, Activision Blizzard announced the upcoming establishment of a new e-sports division.[12] Named Activision Blizzard Media Networks, the division is led by sports executive Steve Bornstein and Major League Gaming (MLG) co-founder Mike Sepso, with assets from the acquisition of the now defunct IGN Pro League. Bornstein was appointed the new division's chairman.[11][43] On December 31, 2015, it was reported that "substantially all" of Major League Gaming's assets would be acquired by Activision Blizzard.[11][43] The New York Times reported that the acquisition was intended to bolster Activision Blizzard's push into e-sports, as well as its plan to develop an e-sports cable channel.[44] Reports indicated that MLG would be shuttered, and that the majority of the purchase price would go towards paying off the company's debt.[11][43] Activision Blizzard acquired MLG on January 4, 2016[44] for $46 million.[11][43] In November 2016, it announced the Overwatch League.

In 2009, Business Insider reported that Worlds.com was claiming it owned the patent to "the idea of a scalable virtual world with thousands of users," with the company's CEO asserting that "he intends to sue anyone who refuses to enter into licensing negotiations - including giants such as Second Life and World of Warcraft.[58] On March 30, 2012, Worlds Inc. filed a patent infringement lawsuit in Massachusetts Federal Court alleging Activision Blizzard had infringed on two patents involving 3-D virtual environments.[59] The lawsuit focused on the Call of Duty and World of Warcraft franchises,[60] and during pre-trial oral arguments, Activision Blizzard lead counsel was quoted stating "billions were at stake."[61] Activision Publishing filed a separate patent infringement lawsuit in California on October 4, 2013,[59] asserting that Worlds, Inc. was using two Activision-owned patents in its Worlds Player software.[62]
In March 2014,[63] a Boston court ruled that Activision was not required to pay Worlds.com "for using talking avatars in popular online titles like World of Warcraft," with the judge clarifying that "the patents belonging to Worlds Inc. appear invalid because the inventions they describe already appeared in public before the patents were filed." Worlds Inc. was limited to only suing Activision Blizzard for "future acts of infringement." Indeed, the Patents themselves at that time were not deemed invalid, rather the Certificate of Correction issued by the USPTO (United States Patent and Trade Office) to cure a defect in the prosecution (filed after the Lawsuit started) required that the Federal Lawsuit be refiled in order to take advantage of the earlier patent priority date. Worlds opted to allow the case to move forward, preserving the timeline and eliminating Activision Blizzards opportunity to directly file a USPTO Patent and Appeal Board challenge. Activision had not exercised its right to file a USPTO appeal to challenge the patents in question during the 1 year statutory time period. In response, Worlds.com announced they would instead be pursuing the recent release Call of Duty: Ghosts for damages.[64] The Worlds, Inc. case against Blizzard Activision was heard on October 3, 2014, with results still unannounced by the end of the year.[65] On June 26, 2015, the Massachusetts courts released a ruling that clarified technical terms for the lawsuit.[66] On November 28, 2016, the United States Patent and Appeal Board ruled claims 5 and 7 valid on US Patent 7493558.[67] The challenge of the US Patent 7493558 was instituted by Bungie, Inc.,an Activision Blizzard game developer.[68]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
