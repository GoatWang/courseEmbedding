We understand that great people make great companies. We do not run companies. We invest in companies and partner with proven management teams. We focus on working with the team to help our portfolio companies grow past the hurdles that are inherent to most growing businesses.





We look to extend the legacy of the business
We focus on opportunities where we can extend your legacy by creating growth and opportunity for the people that run the business. Our approach is to identify areas of excellence in your business that can be leveraged to maximize the success of the business. We also assist management in addressing areas of need and work together to develop solutions.





We have flexible capital
We have patient capital. Our funds do not have any predetermined investment time horizon and are evergreen by design. We are comfortable being a minority or majority stakeholder in our portfolio companies. In certain situations we offer mezzanine debt solutions.

Key Relationships
Our relationships of successful entrepreneurs and investors in the industries we service allows us to bring proprietary knowledge and opportunity to our portfolio companies.








Investor Network
Our Investor Network mostly includes successful entrepreneurs that have experienced historical liquidity events in their prior business ventures. This network enjoys the ability to stay “connected” to business activity at a high level by evaluating and participating financially and intellectually in our opportunities on a deal by deal basis. Our Investor Network often assists us in the following activities:
Investment Evaluation
Management Strategy
Industry Connections








Executive Network
We understand that businesses are complex and that they are not all alike. We believe that businesses grow through the contributions made by people. VergePointe Capital’s Executive Network was formed to capitalize on our relationships with successful executives that know how to grow companies to their next level. Many of these executives are still active in their own business ventures and have allowed us to “tap” their abilities on a situation by situation basis.








Strategic Relationships
VergePointe Capital has established a Strategic Relationship with Peninsula Capital Partners, an investment company specializing in subordinated debt and structured equity (majority and minority) investments in middle-market companies. Through their management of their investment funds, Peninsula has invested over $1.6 billion of capital and have made over 120 investments in a wide range of consumer products and value added manufacturing and distribution companies.
Peninsula Capital Partners has identified VergePointe Capital as a Strategic Resource to assist in the management of selected portfolio companies located on the West Coast. In addition, VergePointe Capital has the opportunity to co-invest alongside Peninsula Capital in these portfolio companies on a company by company basis.
