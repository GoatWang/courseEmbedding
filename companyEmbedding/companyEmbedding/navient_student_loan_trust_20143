Refinance student loans the new-fashioned way
BETTER RATES THROUGH BETTER DATA ANALYSIS



Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can.
How it works












Why Refinance Student Loans


We’ve made saving money on student loans simple. When you refinance student loans, you get credit for the positive changes to your financial profile since you originally took out the loans. A student loan refinance is a good choice for people who have seen advances in their income, career, or credit score since they were in school.


Our data-driven evaluation of your full financial profile gives us the ability to offer qualified borrowers lower, more personalized rates than traditional lenders can. So whether you want to pay off your student faster or just reduce your student loan payments, we can help. Refinance your student loans and accelerate everything that life has to offer.



 



A refinancing experience built to save you time and money
QUICK & SIMPLE TO APPLY





2 MINS TO GET YOUR ESTIMATED RATE
By analyzing information beyond your credit score, we can quickly provide you a rate estimate. You will receive your final rate when your application to refinance has been approved.



LOAN APPLICATION
We look at data other lenders don’t, like savings, education, and earning potential. This helps us build a better picture of your full financial profile so that we can offer the fairest rates possible rates.



LOAN DECISION
If you’re approved to refinance student loans with Earnest, you can set your exact monthly payment and choose between a variable and fixed rate. How do we decide? Read our eligibility guide.



 




“To be able to pay off my student loans before their original term date and save so much on the life of the loan is huge.”
Noel True, NYU MFA – $85,900 Refinanced, $38,400 saved

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Earnest



















            About Us          




We believe many financially responsible people aren’t getting the credit they deserve. That’s why we strive to eliminate unnecessary costs from the banking process and offer our clients the low rates they deserve.


WHY WE STARTED EARNEST


We believe the fundamental role of banks and lenders is to help people realize their hopes and dreams. But we realized the financial system had forgotten this primary purpose, instead serving to enrich a privileged few. So we started Earnest to restore the trust that is sorely missing from the current system, and to build a modern financial institution that actually delivers on making clients’ lives better.


Whatever your ambition, we help get you there. We do low-cost lending to financially responsible people, and allow them to customize their repayment plan to fit their needs. We want to help our clients take control of their finances and realize their dreams—and in doing so create a relationship with them that lasts a lifetime.


WHO WE ARE
We are a skilled team of design, math, finance, and technology geeks who noticed a lack of trust in the financial system and decided to do something about it. We created a company that combines data science, streamlined design, and exceptional service to bring people a fast, low-cost, and hyper-personalized financial experience. Our mission is to make credit more accessible by reducing the costs and barriers faced by millions of financially responsible people.

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

registered assigns, the aggregate original principal sum of TWO
HUNDRED FIFTY-SIX MILLION AND NO/100 DOLLARS ($256,000,000),
payable on each Distribution Date in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount, if any, payable to the Class A Noteholders on
such Distribution Date in respect of principal of the Notes
pursuant to Section 3.1 of the Indenture dated as of August 14,
2014 (the “Indenture”), as amended from time to time,
among the Issuer, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, a New York
banking corporation, as Eligible Lender Trustee on behalf of the
Issuer, and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, a national

This Note is
one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the Issuer, designated
as its Floating Rate Class A Student Loan-Backed Notes (the
“Class A Notes”) which, together with the
Issuer’s Floating Rate Class B Student Loan-Backed Notes (the
“Class B Notes” and, together with the Class A Notes,
the “Notes”), are issued under and secured by the
Indenture, to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental
thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective
rights and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee, the Eligible Lender Trustee and the
Noteholders.  The Notes are subject to all terms of the
Indenture.


 


This Note is
secured equally and ratably with the Collateral pledged as security
therefore as provided in the Indenture.  On any
Distribution Date, interest on each Class A Note will be paid
first, and, thereafter, interest on the Class B Notes will be
paid.  On any Distribution Date, the principal on the
Class A Notes will be paid up to the applicable Class A
Noteholders’ Principal Distribution Amount. Thereafter, on
any Distribution Date, principal on the Class B Notes will be paid
to the Class B Notes up to the applicable Class B
Noteholders’ Principal Distribution
Amount.  Payment priorities following the occurrence and
during the continuation of an Event of Default will change as
described in the Indenture.


 


Principal of the Class A Notes shall be payable
on each Distribution Date in an amount described on the face
hereof.  “Distribution Date” means the 25th
day of each calendar month or, if any such date is not a Business
Day, the next succeeding Business Day, commencing October 27,
2014.


 


As described on the face hereof, the entire
unpaid principal amount of this Note shall be due and payable on
the Class A Maturity Date.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the entire unpaid principal amount of the Notes shall be
due and payable on the date on which (i) an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the Indenture Trustee or
the Noteholders representing not less than a majority of the
Outstanding Amount of the Notes shall have declared the Notes to be
immediately due and payable in the manner provided in
Section 5.2 of the Indenture.  All principal
payments on the Class A Notes shall be made pro rata to the
Noteholders entitled thereto.


 


Interest on the Class A Notes shall be payable
on each Distribution Date on the principal amount outstanding of
the Class A Notes until the principal amount thereof is paid in
full, at a rate per annum equal to the Class A Rate.  The
“Class A Rate” for each Accrual Period, other than the
initial Accrual Period, shall be equal to One-Month LIBOR as
determined on the second Business Day before the beginning of that
Accrual Period plus 0.64%.  The interest for the initial
Accrual Period shall be as set forth in the definition of Class A
Rate contained in Appendix A to the Indenture.


 


If Definitive Notes have been issued as of the
applicable Record Date, then payments of interest on this Note on
each Distribution Date, together with the installment of principal,
if any, to the extent not in full payment of this Note, shall be
made by check mailed to the Person whose name appears as the
Registered Holder of this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes)
on the Note Register on the Record Date.  Such checks
shall be mailed to the Person entitled thereto at the address of
such Person as it appears on the Note Register as of the applicable
Record Date without requiring that this Note be submitted for
notation of payment, and the mailing of such check shall constitute
payment of the amount thereof regardless of

whether such
check is returned undelivered.  With respect to Notes
registered on the applicable Record Date in the name of the nominee
of the Clearing Agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede &
Co.), unless Definitive Notes have been issued, payments shall be
made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account
designated by such nominee.  Any reduction in the
principal amount of this Note (or any one or more Predecessor
Notes) effected by any payments made on any Distribution Date shall
be binding upon all future Noteholders of this Note and of any Note
issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted
hereon.  If funds are expected to be available, as
provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of the then
remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a Distribution
Date, then the Indenture Trustee, in the name of and on behalf of
the Issuer, shall notify the Person who was the Noteholder hereof
as of the preceding Record Date by notice mailed no later than five
days prior to such Distribution Date and the amount then due and
payable shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of
this Note at the Indenture Trustee’s Corporate Trust Office
or at the office of the Indenture Trustee’s agent appointed
for such purposes located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
New York.


 


The Issuer shall pay interest on overdue
installments of interest on this Note at the Class A Rate to the
extent lawful.


 


As provided in the Indenture and subject to
certain limitations set forth therein, the transfer of this Note
shall be registered  on the Note Register upon surrender
of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency
designated by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, duly endorsed
by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee duly executed by, the
Noteholder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, with
such signature guaranteed by an “eligible guarantor
institution” meeting the requirements of the Note Registrar,
which requirements include membership or participation in
Securities Transfer Age

Fitch Takes Various Actions on Six Navient Student Loan Trusts | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Takes Various Actions on Six Navient Student Loan Trusts
    





August 09, 2016 04:54 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions:
    


      Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-2 (NAVSL 2014-2):
    

      --Class A affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-3 (NAVSL 2014-3):
    

      --Class A currently rated 'AAAsf'; placed on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-4 (NAVSL 2014-4):
    

      --Class A affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-5 (NAVSL 2014-5):
    

      --Class A currently rated 'AAAsf'; placed on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-6 (NAVSL 2014-6):
    

      --Class A affirmed at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-7 (NAVSL 2014-7):
    

      --Class A currently rated 'AAAsf'; placed on Rating Watch Negative;
    

      --Class B affirmed at 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The class A notes of NAVSL 2014-3, NAVSL 2014-5 and NAVSL
    

      2014-7 were placed on Rating Watch Negative due to heightened liquidity 
      risk should defaults rise significantly in an interest-rate up scenario. 
      Fitch expects the Negative Watch to be resolved in three months. The 
      affirmations of the notes listed above are a result of the notes passing 
      both the credit and maturity stresses at the commensurate rating level.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      U.S. Sovereign Risk: Each trust's collateral consists of 100% of Federal 
      Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, approximately 15% of which 
      are rehabilitated loans. For each trust, guarantees are provided by 
      eligible guarantors and reinsurance is provided by the U.S. Department 
      of Education (ED) for at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. 
      The U.S. sovereign rating is currently 'AAA', Outlook Stable by Fitch.
    

      Collateral Performance: For the abovementioned trusts, respectively, 
      Fitch assumes base case default rates of 21%, 21%, 21%, 21.25%, 21%, and 
      21%, and default rates under the 'AAA' credit stress scenario of 58.5%, 
      59.25%, 59%, 59.5%, 59.5%, 59.25%. The claim reject rate is assumed to 
      be 0.50% in the base case and 3% in the 'AAA' case for every trust. 
      Fitch applies the standard default timing curve, with the trailing 
      twelve month CDR and prepayment levels as assumptions for FFELP loans in 
      its cash flow analysis.
    

      Current levels of deferment, forbearance and IBR are as follows:
    

      --NAVSL 2014-2: 7.47%, 17.1%, and 11.05%;
    

      --NAVSL 2014-3: 8.04%, 14.61%, and 9.35%;
    

      --NAVSL 2014-4: 7.84%, 15.17%, and 8.74%;
    

      --NAVSL 2014-5: 7.3%, 13.97%, and 8.55%;
    

      --NAVSL 2014-6: 6.63%, 15.28%, and 8.48%;
    

      --NAVSL 2014-7: 7.41%, 16.38%, and 8.94%.
    

      These assumptions are used as the starting point in cash flow modelling. 
      Subsequent declines or increases are modelled as per criteria. The 
      borrower benefit is assumed to be approximately 0.14%, 0.17%, 0.16%, 
      0.18%, 0.18%, and 0.16%, respectively, for the abovementioned trusts, 
      based on information provided by the sponsor.
    

      Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and 
      interest rate stresses to these trusts as per the agency's criteria.
    

      Payment Structure: For each trust, credit enhancement (CE) is provided 
      by excess spread and overcollateralization. For the Class A note, 
      subordination is provided by the Class B note. As of the July 2016 
      distribution report, total parity is 104.71%, 104.71%, 104.71%, 104.71%, 
      104.71%, and 104.71% (4.50% CE) for the abovementioned trusts, 
      respectively, and senior parity is 108.16%, 108.16%, 108.23%, 108.23%, 
      108.26%, and 108.20% for the abovementioned trusts, respectively. Excess 
      cash will continue to be released from the trusts given a target CE 
      amount equal to the greatest of 4.50% of the adjusted pool balance and 
      $2.75 million has been maintained. Liquidity support is provided by a 
      reserve account for each trust. The required reserve account balance for 
      each trust on any distribution dates prior to Aug. 25, 2019 (the 
      step-down date) is 2.25% of the current student loan balance; then on 
      and after the step-down date, the greater of 0.25% of the current 
      student loan balance or 0.10% of the initial student loan balance.
    

      Maturity Risk: Fitch's SLABS cash flow model indicates that the notes 
      for every trust are paid in full on or prior to their respective legal 
      final maturities.
    

      Operational Capabilities: Navient Solutions, Inc. (FKA Sallie Mae, 
      Inc.), ACS, and Great Lakes are the master servicer, sub-servicer and 
      sub-servicer, respectively, and are responsible for the day to day 
      servicing of the portfolio for each trust. Fitch believes all to be 
      acceptable servicers of FFELP student loans at this time.
    

      CRITERIA VARIATIONS
    

      For transactions in surveillance, Fitch will treat certain assets such 
      as claims filed as short-term assets in its cash flow analysis. Given 
      that Fitch's current criteria is silent on the treatment of such assets, 
      this treatment is considered a criteria variation.
    

      Under the "Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered 
      Bonds", dated July 18, 2016, Fitch looks to its own ratings in analyzing 
      counterparty risk and assessing a counterparty's creditworthiness. The 
      definition of the permitted investment for this deal allows possibility 
      of using investments not rated by Fitch; this represents a criteria 
      variation. Fitch doesn't believe that such variation has a measurable 
      impact upon the ratings assigned.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since the FFELP student loan ABS relies on the U.S. government to 
      reimburse defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem 
      with the 'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign 
      rating, defaults, basis risk, and loan extension risk account for the 
      majority of the risk embedded in FFELP student loan transactions. 
      Additional defaults, basis shock beyond Fitch's published stresses, 
      lower than expected payment speed, and other factors could result in 
      future downgrades. Likewise, a buildup of CE driven by positive excess 
      spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future

Fitch Affirms Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-8 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-8
    





November 10, 2016 10:58 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the outstanding senior and subordinate notes 
      of Navient Student Loan Trust 2014-8 at 'AAAsf' and 'Asf', respectively. 
      The Rating Outlook is Stable. The affirmations are due to the notes 
      passing both Fitch's credit and maturity stresses at the commensurate 
      rating level. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this 
      release.
    

      Although the class B note passes Fitch's 'AA' cash flow stress 
      scenarios, the recommendation is to affirm at 'Asf' because the implied 
      ratings from Fitch's cash flow model are sensitive to modest increases 
      in defaults. Despite the observation of recent high defaults in the 
      trust, Fitch expects defaults to decrease in the coming years as the 
      collateral seasons. If the default decline does not materialize, ratings 
      may be affected.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      U.S. Sovereign Risk: The trust collateral consists of Federal Family 
      Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, 20.2% of which are rehabilitated 
      loans. Guarantees are provided by the transaction's eligible guarantors 
      and reinsurance is provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for 
      at least 97% of principal and accrued interest. Fitch's U.S. sovereign 
      rating is currently 'AAA'/Outlook Stable.
    

      Collateral Performance: Due to observations of recent high defaults for 
      this trust, a proxy was used to account for the actual trust 
      performance. Fitch assumes a base case default rate of 29.25% and a 
      64.00% default rate under the 'AAAsf' credit stress scenario. The base 
      case default assumption of 29.25% implies a constant default rate of 
      9.0% (assuming a weighted average life of 3.3 years); equal to the 
      trailing-12-month (TTM) constant default rate (CDR) utilized in the 
      maturity stresses. Fitch believes defaults will likely decline as the 
      trust's collateral becomes more seasoned. Fitch applies the standard 
      default timing curve in its credit stress cash flow analysis. The claim 
      reject rate is assumed to be 0.50% in the base case and 3.0% in the 
      'AAAsf' case.
    

      The TTM average levels of deferment, forbearance, income-based repayment 
      (before adjustment) and constant prepayment rate (voluntary and 
      involuntary) are 11.9%, 18.2%, 12.8% and 14.7%, respectively, which are 
      used as the starting point in cash flow modelling. Subsequent declines 
      or increases are modelled as per criteria. The borrower benefit is 
      assumed to be approximately 0.07%, based on information provided by the 
      sponsor.
    

      Basis and Interest Rate Risk: Fitch applies its standard basis and 
      interest rate stresses to this trust as per the agency's criteria.
    

      Payment Structure: Credit Enhancement (CE) is provided by excess spread, 
      overcollateralization, and, for the senior class A notes, the 
      subordination of the class B note. Liquidity support is provided by a 
      reserve account currently sized at $1,958,717. The reserve account 
      balance is required to be maintained at the greater of (i) 0.25% of the 
      pool balance and (ii) $1,019,764. As of the July 2016 distribution date, 
      senior parity is 104.8% (4.6% CE) and total parity is at the specified 
      overcollateralization of 101.01% (1.0% CE). Excess cash will be released 
      to the certificate holder as long as the target overcollateralization 
      amount, equal to the greater of 1.0% CE or $1,500,000, is maintained.
    

      Maturity Risk: Fitch's student loan ABS cash flow model indicates that 
      the notes are paid in full on or prior to the legal final maturity dates 
      under the commensurate rating scenario.
    

      Operational Capabilities: Navient Solutions, Inc. (Navient) provides 
      day-to-day servicing for the trust's entire portfolio. Fitch believes 
      Navient is an acceptable servicer of FFELP student loans.
    

      CRITERIA VARIATIONS
    

      Under Fitch's criteria 'Rating U.S. Federal Family Education Loan 
      Program Student Loan ABS Criteria', dated July 26, 2016, Fitch does not 
      address the process by which it gives certain credit to short-term 
      assets in its cash flow analysis, and it is therefore considered a 
      criteria variation. There is no rating impact from such variation.
    

      Under Fitch's criteria 'Rating U.S. Federal Family Education Loan 
      Program Student Loan ABS Criteria', dated July 26, 2016, Fitch utilizes 
      its Default Model to derive lifetime default rate assumptions. Fitch 
      assumed a base case default rate for the credit stresses based on actual 
      trust performance, which is higher than the output from its Default 
      Model, and is therefore considered a criteria variation. Had the Default 
      Model output been used as the base case, the implied rating for the 
      class B note would have been 'AA' as well, but would be less sensitive 
      to increases in defaults.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since the FFELP student loan ABS relies on the U.S. government to 
      reimburse defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem 
      with the 'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign 
      rating, defaults, basis risk, and loan extension risk account for the 
      majority of the risk embedded in FFELP student loan transactions. 
      Additional defaults, basis shock beyond Fitch's published stresses, 
      lower than expected payment speed, and other factors could result in 
      future downgrades. Likewise, a buildup of CE driven by positive excess 
      spread given favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future 
      upgrades.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in

      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Disclaimers




The average savings calculation is the sum of all projected savings divided by the number of clients included in the projected savings calculation. These calculations assume that clients’ interest rates will not change over time, that clients make all payments on-time, and that no loans will be prepaid.
Here’s what our math includes:

Projected savings for clients who provided outstanding balance, APR, and current monthly payment amount for their existing student loan(s)
Both fixed and variable rate loans

And here’s what our math excludes, and why:

Savings from any client who stated that the current interest rate on their loan was greater than 12%. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where client error may skew the savings calculation higher.)
For any client who stated that the projected term of their loan was greater than 25 years, we do not include in our calculation any additional savings that might be realized if their existing loan were to take longer than 25 years to pay off in-full. (Why: 25 years is the maximum term allowed for a Federal student loan, or the cap on any Federal student loan under Income Based Repayment.)
Savings from any client whose indicated monthly payment was not sufficient to pay down the loan balance over time. (Why: this is intended to filter out any cases where the client misstated either their monthly payment amount, interest rate, or both.)
All refinancings by clients who chose a longer term than their existing student loan. (Why: some clients choose longer loan terms to match their monthly loan obligations to their unique life circumstances; while we encourage clients to take advantage of Earnest’s flexible term and monthly payment features, these cases are not indicative of the savings that result from lower rates through better data.)



Explanation of Rates “With Autopay”
Rates shown include 0.25% APR reduction where client agrees to make monthly principal and interest payments by automatic electronic payment. Use of autopay is not required to receive an Earnest loan.


Explanation of Precision Pricing™ Savings
Savings calculations are based on refinancing $121,825 in student loans at an existing loan servicer’s interest rate of 7.5% fixed APR with 10 years, 6 months remaining on the loan term. The other lender’s savings and APR (light green line) represent what would happen if those loans were refinanced at the other lender’s best fixed APRs. The Earnest savings and APR (white line) represent refinancing those loans at Earnest’s best fixed APRs.
Savings is computed as the difference between the future scheduled payments on the existing loans and payments on new Earnest and “other lender” loans. The calculation assumes on-time loan payments, no change in interest rates, and no prepayment of loans.

Earnest



















            About Us          




We believe many financially responsible people aren’t getting the credit they deserve. That’s why we strive to eliminate unnecessary costs from the banking process and offer our clients the low rates they deserve.


WHY WE STARTED EARNEST


We believe the fundamental role of banks and lenders is to help people realize their hopes and dreams. But we realized the financial system had forgotten this primary purpose, instead serving to enrich a privileged few. So we started Earnest to restore the trust that is sorely missing from the current system, and to build a modern financial institution that actually delivers on making clients’ lives better.


Whatever your ambition, we help get you there. We do low-cost lending to financially responsible people, and allow them to customize their repayment plan to fit their needs. We want to help our clients take control of their finances and realize their dreams—and in doing so create a relationship with them that lasts a lifetime.


WHO WE ARE
We are a skilled team of design, math, finance, and technology geeks who noticed a lack of trust in the financial system and decided to do something about it. We created a company that combines data science, streamlined design, and exceptional service to bring people a fast, low-cost, and hyper-personalized financial experience. Our mission is to make credit more accessible by reducing the costs and barriers faced by millions of financially responsible people.

So whether you want to pay off your student faster or just reduce your student loan payments, we can help. Refinance your student loans and accelerate everything that life has to offer.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

SunTrust Private Student Loans




















Choosing the right private student loan is as important as choosing the right college





Apply online now. It's the smart way to get the money to cover your college essentials.

A few simple things to know before you apply.

Repayment Plans1
Take a moment to consider the best way for you to pay back your loan. There are up to four options to choose from:

Immediate Repayment
Interest-Only Repayment2
Partial Interest Repayment2
In-School Deferment2

Interest Rate Options
Choose between a fixed or variable rate:

Fixed ratesYour rate will never change.3
Variable ratesVariable rates are based on market conditions, so if market rates go up or down, so does your rate.



What you want, including a graduation present.

Interest Rate Reductions
Even a small percentage can make a big difference.

0.25% for automatic loan payment withdrawal4
An additional 0.25% if your automatic payment is from a SunTrust account4
1% principal balance reduction upon graduation5

Cosigners are great
If someone with a good credit history is a cosigner, your Custom Choice Loan is more likely to be approved. It could be an eligible parent, guardian, or a friend.
In-school Refinance Option
With this new option, you can refinance existing private student loans into a new Custom Choice Loan.

Your new loan will give you the flexibility to select a repayment term and repayment option that is right for you now.
The process is easy  after approval this option will be presented  just list which loans you'd like to refinance.

        SunTrust Bank, Member FDIC. © 2017 SunTrust Banks, Inc.
        SunTrust and the Custom Choice Loan are federally registered service marks of SunTrust Banks, Inc.
        
        Certain restrictions and limitations may apply. SunTrust Bank reserves the right to change or discontinue these programs without notice. All loan programs are subject to approval and may not be available in certain jurisdictions.
SunTrust recommends comparing all aid alternatives including grants, scholarships, and both federal and private student loans. Compare SunTrust private student loans.

1 Any applicant who applies for the loan the month of, the month prior to, or the month after their graduation date, as stated on the application or certified by the school, will only be offered the immediate repayment option.
2 Making interest only payments while in school will not reduce the principal balance on the loan. Partial Interest Payment plan of $25 per month is available on loans of $5,000 or more; click here to see payment examples. For Partial Interest and Fully Deferred loans, any accrued and unpaid interest will be capitalized (added to your principal loan balance) when repayment of principal and interest begins. Payments may be deferred (a) while student is enrolled at least half-time at an approved school, and (b) during the 6 month grace period after graduation or dropping below half-time status, but the total initial deferment period, including the grace period, may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. In any case, the initial deferment period may not exceed 66 months from the first disbursement date. There are no prepayment penalties.
3 The fixed interest rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the ACH reduction benefit(s).
4 Interest rate reductions offered for automatic payment from a bank account: 0.25% interest rate reduction for ACH payment from any bank account and an extra 0.25% interest rate reduction when ACH payments are made from a SunTrust Bank account. ACH interest rate reduction(s) only apply when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. Interest rate reduction(s) will remain on the account unless (a) the automatic deduction of payments is stopped (including times during deferment or forbearance) or (b) there are three automatic deductions returned for insufficient funds within the life of the loan. The additional SunTrust Bank account ACH interest rate reduction will be applied after the first automatic payment is successfully deducted from a SunTrust Bank checking, savings or money market account and will be removed for the reasons stated above or if you close your SunTrust account. In the event the benefit(s) is removed, the interest rate stated in the Credit Agreement shall be applied in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.
5 The 1% principal reduction is based on the net disbursed loan amount, which is the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding the dollar amount of any reductions, cancellations, or returns, as applicable. To receive the reward, the benefit must be requested from the servicer, and the student borrower must have earned a bachelor's degree or higher and proof of such graduation (e.g. copy of diploma, final transcript or letter on school letterhead) must be provided to the servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student borrower receives more than one degree.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
