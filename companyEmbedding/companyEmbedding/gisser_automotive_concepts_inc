1 (A United States SEC Approved Public Reporting Company) GISSER AUTOMOTIVE CONCEPTS, INC. INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS GAC Overview: Company, Products and the Market: GAC s Mission: The Company, now a United States SEC Approved Public Reporting Company, is built on the idea that it will be an independent high-performance, automobile designer and manufacturer of our production model MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel, mid-engine, super-exotic, hand-built vehicles in the Upper-Level: Exotic/Super-Luxury and Mid- Level: Ultra-Luxury/Prestige Sports Coupe market segments. GAC believes that we have unlimited market potential in the unexploited world markets of Automotive Advanced Energy Technology primarily electric and/or alternative fuel such as hydrogen, fuel-cell, solar, natural gas or hybrid. GAC s Accomplishments: The Company has developed and built prototypes of their mid-engine, super-exotic sports coupe, (the "MEC4") and has set up manufacturing to produce the first run of these vehicles. GAC has completed the better part of R&D and has invested more than USD $25 million. GAC owns the production tooling molds, has successfully filed and received our patent; built both a prototype and road ready pre-production MEC4 and stands ready to finalize the remaining R&D to commence full production, advertising & marketing on our MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel vehicles. Eager Customers for GAC s MEC4: GAC s electric and/or alternative fuel MEC4 is America s first independent hand-built, high-performance, mid-engine, super-exotic sports coupe. It is the actualization of more than 30 years of talk in the market, by manufacturers, major automobile trade publications and industry analysts who have stated that a growing market exists for this type of niche vehicle. Road & Track has recognized willingness by customers to pay USD $150,000 or more for this type of mid-engine super-exotic sports coupe. The Automotive Luxury Segments: The Upper-Level: Exotic/Super-Luxury Automobile Market is approximately 7,000 units in the USA (10,000 globally) or USD $1.5 billion annually, while the Mid-Level: Ultra-Luxury/Prestige Sports Coupe market enjoys four times the sales volume, more than 30,000 Sports Coupes of the 100,000 units per year or USD $3 billion annually. This represented a combined United States market of USD $4.5 billion. United States Luxury Automotive Market Segments (Source: Automotive News) Luxury Vehicle Market USD Approx. Price Range Units Sold (approx.) Upper-Level: Exotic/Super-Luxury Automobiles $150,000 - $1,000, ,000 (7,000 in the USA) Mid-Level: Ultra-Luxury/Prestige Sports Coupes $70,000 - $150, ,000 (30,000 are coupes) Entry-Level: Luxury Vehicles Up to $70,000 1,000,000 (in the USA alone) Other Manufacturers Prepare for Ongoing Market Growth: Sports car manufacturers such as Tesla, Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Jaguar, Daimler-Chrysler, etc. have posted on-going record sales and have responded to this increased market demand by stepping-up production. Furthermore marques have introduced new models in anticipation of industry analysts unlimited electric vehicle market expansion and predicted market growth over the coming years. Page 12 GAC s Wealthiest Home Market: Gisser Automotive Concepts home market, the United States, is the largest and wealthiest market in the world for high performance vehicles. This market has been experiencing phenomenal growth since 1997 in the Mid- Level: Ultra-Luxury/Prestige Sports Coupe and Upper-Level: Exotic/Super-Luxury Automotive Market Segments. GAC s Products and Services Projections: The MEC4 s Unique Pricing and Marketing Strategy: Due to GAC s In-House abilities to design, engineer and manufacture our MEC4, we have effectively decreased the costs of bringing the MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel vehicles to market. GAC can easily price our super-exotic in the Upper-Level: Exotic/Super-Luxury Automobile Market - 10,000 Units (one tenth the size) compared to the Mid-Level: Ultra-Luxury/Prestige Sports Coupe Market - 100,000 Units. However, we intend to set a USD $118,000 Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the MEC4 electric to target and compete in the larger Mid-Level: Ultra- Luxury/Prestige Sports Coupe Market. Due to its phenomenal styling, dynamic performance, assured safety and functional practicality that were all highly emphasized in the design engineering of the vehicle, the production model MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel super-exotic can easily be classified along with the Upper-Level: Luxury Automobile Market priced between USD $150,000 and $1,000,000+. The MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel is in fact substantially less in price than comparable super-exotic vehicles in this under-exploited niche and therefore a greater value with marketplace advantages for GAC. Management is confident that these factors and the MEC4 s expected initial market acceptance will help us to attain more than the anticipated sales. GAC s Projections: The Company s conservative projections of less than 1% market share (400 units) by year five will result in USD $150 million cumulative revenues for the period and profit margins approaching 37%. This does not include any other of GAC s anticipated revenues from any other products or services. GAC s Projected Revenues from DIY Auto Parts: GAC anticipates generating additional revenues from the USD $35 billion DIY Auto Parts and Accessories segment of the Automotive Aftermarket. According to Automotive Aftermarket Industry Association (AAIA), total annualized sales several reached USD $257 billion recently and have been growing at a rate of USD $10 billion annually. GAC s Management Team: GAC s Management Team during the development stage consists of professionals who have extensive technical, manufacturing and automotive knowledge and experience, as well as, confirmable accomplishments in financing, administration, sales and marketing. The Company s Management Team during development has well over 100 years experience in the automotive industry and the ability to accurately analyze and assess the Company s progress. Mr. Daryl K. Gisser has been our President and CEO since our inception in He has been involved in many aspects of the automotive business for over 30 years with expertise in metals fabrication, welding, fiberglass construction and thermoforming. He has designed, engineered and built several fiberglass/composite vehicles. His varied expertise in automotive design and development ranges from conceptual sketches and renderings to the execution of three-dimensional clay models, scale and full size, utilized as bucks in the creation of prototypes, molds and tooling for production. Mr. Gisser holds degrees in Engineering and Design. Due to Mr. Gisser s father, also a Director in GAC, and holding a position of Captain (Retired) in the United States Air Force (USAF) and Major in the New York State Guard, Mr. Daryl K. Gisser s interests were vigorously enhanced towards aviation and aerodynamics. This ongoing concentration has lead to new projects in aviation and aeronautics away from GAC including the PULITSOR HP-SFS. GAC is in the process of reviewing these projects under development with our patent attorneys for the filing of what seems to be a groundbreaking utility patent with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). GAC has planned for our future Management & Consulting Team via GAC s intended acquisition of The Wall Street Organization, Inc. (WSO), Mr. Stephen M. Cole, President/CEO of WSO in preparation of next stages of GAC s ongoing expansion and upcoming requirements for Financial Public Relations and Investor Awareness and Mr. Walter J. Antonell, Senior Vice President of M&As at WSO, a planned wholly owned subsidiary of GAC. GAC s Target Market s Increasing Growth: Luxury Automotive Market s Steady Growth and Increased Sales: The Luxury Automotive Market has been experiencing steady growth since 1980 at an average rate of 6.9% annually with major increases since Leading automotive analysts forecast this automotive market segment to double over the next few years from 33,000 to 60,000 units. These higher end markets are less cyclical in comparison to the total car market, which is not as recession proof and only increased an average of 2.2% over the same period. Increases in sales were due in part to post baby boomers being in their peak earning years, accumulating wealth and representing the largest buying power population group in the developed world. These buyers of high-end luxury goods and vehicles can be found almost anywhere on the globe and are less affected by economic conditions. Page 2 3 GAC's Largest Target Market is the United States, is minting almost all of the World's Millionaires: A Credit Suisse report shows that 1.7 million of the 1.8 million millionaires added to the ranks in the past year were created in the U.S., which now boasts 13.2 million millionaires. Rising stock markets, the housing rebound and a broader increase in asset values have fueled the surge. Join the Ranks of the New Millionaires by Investing in Small-Cap Stocks: World Wealth Report's announcement of a 12% increase in millionaires worldwide in 2011, World Wealth Report, researched by Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (BAC) and Cap Gemini, and asked some big shots there and elsewhere what it takes to become a millionaire. Get back into the market. Are you satisfied with the microscopic interest rates you're getting on your CDs and savings accounts? Go where the rich are going. Many of the new millionaires in 2010 reached the seven-figure mark by taking on more risk in equities, the study said, and more are expected to do the same in Small-Cap stocks have been a good choice -- They've outperformed the biggies for several years. (See Experts Luxury Market Report: Credit Suisse, World Wealth, Merrill Lynch, Cap Gemini) Credit Suisse Luxury Goods Fund (3 yrs.) Oct Oct GAC, the SEC & FINRA: GAC, a United States Publicly Trading Company...Just about There! GAC s Approval with the SEC: (GAC) has filed an S-1 Registration Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and has received its Notice of Effectiveness on December 8, GAC is now a United States SEC Approved Public Reporting Company and is actively negotiating its way toward signing numerous selling agreements with Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Registered Broker-Dealers. GAC s Form 15c2-11 filed with FINRA: Our Form 15c2-11, which was filed through our sponsoring Market Maker with FINRA, is expected to be updated and finalized within the very near future. This will enable GAC to receive its Ticker Symbol and begin trading on the OTC:BB, NASDAQ and/or other US or international public stock exchanges. GAC s Financial Public Relations via WSO: Given GAC s status as a United States SEC Approved Public Reporting Company and our plans of coming to market shortly, we have arranged as part of GAC s intended acquisition of WSO, that WSO will again assist GAC to perform In-House GAC s financial Public Relations (PR) and Investor Relations (IR). The intended acquisition of WSO is based on their strategic, effective and results oriented track record of nearly two decades of promoting and assisting their clients with market awareness and a long list of services with no regulatory issues. (See WSO Acquisition later in this doc) A portion of GAC s available funds will be allocated towards a productive PR & IR campaign with the primary goal of increasing GAC s daily trading price and volume. A large percent of funds GAC has on-hand, through loan commitments and proceeds of this any additional Offerings will be utilized towards the development, production and marketing of GAC s products and services. GAC s Ongoing Product Development: While GAC proceeds with the SEC s ongoing Public Reporting Requirements, now as a United States SEC Approved Public Reporting Company and with FINRA to obtain our Ticker Symbol and begin Trading. GAC plans to incorporate the latest available technology for implementation into the Company s final production model MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel vehicle or other Advanced Energy Technology such as hydrogen, fuel-cell, solar, natural gas or hybrid. This model MEC4 will be modified with plans of being produced in a Southern California facility which we are in the process of identifying the site selection for GAC s Corporate Headquarters and Production Facility. GAC s Exit Strategy: The Company s primary investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns through the production and sale of our MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel, super-exotic sports coupe and future products and related services. As a United States SEC Approved Public Reporting Company, GAC s exit strategy now involves listing and trading GAC s securities on a listed exchange or quotation system in various marketplaces in the United States such as the OTC:BB, NASDAQ, other US and foreign public stock exchanges that appeal to our requirements or through any other means that is permitted by applicable law. Page 3 4 GAC s Established Presence and Relocation to Southern California USA A Host of Benefits! Southern California, the epicenter of the world's car culture: In July 2010, GAC has formally established a presence in Southern California, the epicenter of America's, if not the entire world's car culture and research and testing facilities. The region s rich history and existing infrastructure lend many new opportunities to our Company, including direct access to Registered FINRA Broker-Dealers and accredited investors and/or networks. Most remarkable and of significant value is the region s affluent consumer market steeped in auto enthusiasm and history with the industry s experts. GAC s Manufacturer s Certification & Instant USD $1 million Savings: In Southern California, GAC has negotiated from USD $1.6 million to $500,000 with the selected Low Volume Automobile Certification Firm for certification of the MEC4. All testing and certification will be addressed to meet the Department of Transportation (DOT), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA & CARB if applicable) for our final production model MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel vehicles and all Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). GAC s plans to relocate to Southern California to enable us to work In-House with the Automobile Certification Firm on the MEC4 s engineering, design and certification requirements working side by side thereby reducing costs. GAC has identified and selected this Low Volume Automobile Certification Firm as our working partner to proceed through the process of receiving GAC s Manufacturer s Certification for the production model MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel vehicles. GAC, a Ground Level Investment Opportunity, follows Tesla Motors business model: GAC s historic track record since incorporation in 1997, our initial market acceptance and accomplishments, our cumulative investment of over USD $25M into the Company which is ongoing is more than suggestive of a successful operating history involving a broad range of corporate activities. These facts include GAC s continued successes as well as GAC now being a United States SEC Approved Public Reporting Company. GAC is now similarly poised to emulate Tesla as a viable business model and enduring financial and industry market sensation. Tesla is amongst the first successfully commercially produced and marketed electric automobile manufacturers with substantial acceptance by consumers and the automotive industry. Bolstering GAC is the current global economy s growth along with ongoing loans from Management, the addition of adequate funding from our Offering, similar Loans Programs and Tax Incentives and our existing Tax Asset of $10M. GAC, which is in the same Standard Industrial Classification (SIC Code of Motor Vehicles and Passenger Car Bodies) such as Tesla Motors, now stands under the same star. As of October 1, 2013, Tesla Motors stock price has experienced a meteoric rise from USD $15 per share to over USD $190 per share since becoming Public or a Return on Investment (ROI) of about 1,300%. (TSLA) GAC Qualifies for Federal Loan Programs and CA Tax Incentives: Tesla Motors has been successful in obtaining US Government loans specifically for the niche automotive industry and other incentives as a California based company which includes their USD $465 million in long-term loans and USD $31 million in tax incentives. GAC Qualifies for ATVM Loan Program: GAC (SIC 3711), plans to submit applications for loan programs which are available from the United States Department of Energy's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program or ATVM Program. GAC Qualifies for California Alternative Energy Tax Incentives: As part of GAC s plans to relocate to California, we also expect to receive tax incentives from the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority as part of our plan of relocating and our planned final production model MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel vehicles. These incentives would be in addition to GAC s approximate USD $10M Tax Credit. GAC and Federal Economic Stimulation: GAC plans to apply for federal and state grants, loans and tax incentives under government programs designed to stimulate the economy and support the production of electric vehicles and related technologies. We believe new opportunities will arise for grants, loans and other incentives from the United States, State and other governments. GAC s Existing Corporate Tax Asset: During the Development Stage, GAC has accumulated a Net Operating Loss (NOL) or investment in GAC since inception into the development, design, engineering and organizing exceeding USD $28M. Similar projects of this magnitude realize start up costs of USD $50M. (Source: Automotive Associates International (AAI). This NOL translates into a Company Tax Asset and credit of approximately USD $10M which will significantly reduce corporate income taxes in the near future. Page 45 County, State and Federal Level Incentive Packages: GAC is negotiating a list of incentives at the County, State and Federal Levels as part of relocating our high profile, multi faceted luxury oriented business and diversified products including the MEC4 electric and/or alternative fuel vehicles and varied multi-industry services to any State including CA. As such, GAC has already been in contact with The City of San Diego, CA - Business Incentives Program and The San Diego, CA Regional Economic Development Corporation (SDREDC) for a list of available incentive programs. We have received over 50 possible Commercial Locations as part of GAC s Site Selection Process. Additionally, GAC s existing contacts are with some of the Country s largest Real Estate Investment, Lenders and Management Companies. One in particular has issued GAC a USD $5 million Loan Commitment backed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Some other firms and banks GAC is in contact with deal primarily with low priced Commercial Foreclosure, pre-foreclosure, Short Sale and Bank Owned, REO Properties with the goal of providing our Shareholders additional financial benefits and long term increases on their investment. GAC s Philosophy: Diversification Increases Revenues & In-House Operations Reduces Costs: GAC s Two Part Philosophy: GAC has already proven the first part and plans to fulfill both parts of our Philosophy: 1) Reduce Costs, and 2) Increase Revenues thereby increasing the Company s Valuation and in turn Shareholder benefits of an increased Return on Investment (ROI). In-House Proven Reduced Cost Philosophy: Taking this one step further, GAC Management s benefits and examples of both reduce costs and provided services, financial public relations for GAC as well as providing a long list of services to other companies. The benefit of being able to perform as much of our In-House work has been the primary reason for GAC s successful accomplishments to date. From conceptual drawings, plans, engineering abilities, production of actual 3-D models and functioning vehicles is but the tip of the iceberg. GAC has expanded our In-House abilities to all aspects of what is required of today s most successful Corporations through our current contacts and the acquisition of The Wall Street Organization, Inc., (WSO). GAC has also performed, for the most part, all required services In-House related to becoming a United States SEC Approved Public Reporting Company. GAC s Diversification System into Other Products and Services equals Potential Additional Revenue Streams: GAC s Philosophy has developed a Diversification System that focuses the following three categories: 1) Developing new or additional products in various markets at GAC to add on to our primary product line 2) Offering services that GAC is familiar with and the services of WSO provided via GAC s planned acquisition 3) Acquisitions of companies that GAC can develop and bring under GAC s corporate roof 1) Developing New and Additional Products in Various Markets: Once acquired, GAC has plans to bring to market a number of other follow on products utilizing GAC s existing design and engineering expertise like the PULITSOR HP-SFS. The PULITSOR HP-SFS : The PULITSOR HP-SFS is a Stealth Flight System designed for rapid deployment by individuals or tandems. It has the unique capability of full stealth characteristics. The PULITSOR HP-SFS is a ready-for-flight system requiring less than several minutes to set up and become airborne and its very engineering makes it easy to transport when not in use. Many of its controlling surfaces, sections and features are either retractable or aerodynamically morphing panels for the most in flight maneuverability. GAC will be able to market The PULITSOR HP-SFS both commercially and militarily. The PULITSOR HP- SFS is characterized by its extended flight range, medium to high altitude flights and high maneuverability. The PULITSOR HP- SFS is engineered for ultra-high volume manufacturing utilizing many advanced and composite materials in key components and throughout the unit. There are many military applications, both offensive and defensive, in all military branches. The PULITSOR HP- SFS is also marketable to the entire world for recreation, entertainment and as a new alternative for independent or tandem travel. 2) Offering Services to other Companies: GAC will offer a spectrum of specialized and multi-market services we required both for operations, in becoming a US Public Company and through the development of our products. Other services will be offered via WSO and GAC s planned acquisition. (See WSO Services Offered below) GAC will offer our services in the entire spectrum of the automotive industry related to specialty automotive design and engineering, concept cars, marine and other prototypes in a broad range of industries and materials used in our products such as fiberglass, Kevlar, carbon fiber, composite materials, steel and aluminum making use of our expertise and past experience. GAC will also offer other core business services for companies who are private or who wish to become public. These services include marketing materials, website design, brochures, newsletters, investor and Shareholder documents, organizational skills, bookkeeping and SEC level financial accounting and legal document preparation for business and for submission and acceptance to the SEC and FINRA. Page 56 3) Acquisitions of Private or Public Companies and GAC s expansion as a SEC Public Holding Company: In early 2013, GAC Management has decided to search and identify companies that GAC, being a United States SEC Approved Public Reporting Company, can develop and bring under GAC s corporate roof. Revenue generating companies who wish to be public would also provide other potential streams of income for the Company and our Shareholders once acquired and a diversified portfolio in concept. Management has identified several companies and plans to negotiate the acquisition of each. GAC s high profile product that commands much media attention can also provide public companies much investor awareness as an acquisition. GAC has discussed our Diversification System and more specifically, becoming a Public Holding Company with the SEC. GAC s expansion and diversification requirements through various acquisitions by GAC do not involve any significant applications other than that related to multiple or all encompassing SIC Code modifications. GAC s first planned acquisition is that of The Wall Street Organization, Inc. (WSO): GAC s President & CEO, Mr. Daryl K. Gisser and WSO s President & CEO, Mr. Stephen M. Cole have spent considerable time negotiating and have agreed to the Terms of the 100% Acquisition of The Wall Street Organization, Inc. (WSO),  A Letter of Intent (LOI) has been submitted on the SEC s Form 8-K which has been formally filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). GAC s 100% Acquisition of WSO was intended to bring a firm to provide GAC s required financial PR & IR Campaigns In-House but may potentially provide vast benefits to both WSO s and GAC s Shareholders. The Wall Street Organization, Inc., (WSO) was originally Incorporated in 1997 by its Founder, Stephen M. Cole, President and CEO, to provide companies seeking funding for start-up, growth, reorganization or expansion with the tools they need to successfully identify and attract the appropriate funding. WSO has an impressive track record of providing both domestic and international clientele with the financial marketing/promotion results oriented services. WSO s services include but are not limited to assisting clients with the marketing co-ordination of their capital formation requirements, both onshore and offshore, financial marketing/advertising and mergers and acquisitions. WSO is equipped to assist companies in a diverse array of industries with a wide range of proven results oriented financial marketing services on a global scale. The following is a list of services provided by The Wall Street Organization, Inc. : Financial Public Relations Investor Awareness including Investor Newsletters, Corporate Profiles and organizing additional strategic and sophisticated marketing materials for foreign and domestic clientele Creation, copywriting, design, implementation, printing, websites of any and all marketing materials Providing clientele with referrals to properly licensed investment networks specialists, Registered FINRA Broker- Dealers, Offshore Marketing Firms to include private offshore investors Referral service to domestic and offshore funding groups and investor networks Strategic, effective and results oriented Financial Marketing Campaigns and related Marketing Services Media oriented Financial Advertising Agency with access to scores of global investor publications Investor Relations, proven international/national lead generation program Mergers & Acquisitions Coordination and organization of offshore Regulation S Private Placements and onshore Regulation D Private Placements Providing an effective conduit to companies seeking funding, both foreign and domestic, to a vast potential selection of funding sources.

                       10,000,000 shares of Common Stock 
  This is our initial public offering of common stock. The initial  public offering price is $1.00 per share. No public market currently  exists for our common stock. We are selling 10,000,000 shares of common  stock which have $.01 par value per share. This represents 42.27% of the  total outstanding shares based on the maximum amount of the offering. We  are a manufacturer of superexotic luxury sports coupes and have not  engaged in marketing the products as yet. Prior to this offering there  has been no public market for the shares. The initial public offering  price of the shares has been arbitrarily determined by us and does not  bear any relationship to such established valuation criteria as assets,  book value or prospective earnings. We are a New York corporation.    We will sell the shares ourselves. We do not plan to use  underwriters or pay any commissions. We will be selling our shares in a  direct participation offering and no one has agreed to buy any of our  shares. The offering will terminate no later than December 31, 2008, and  unless a minimum of 500,000 Shares are sold by that time the proceeds  will be returned with interest. We will escrow the proceeds with a  commercial Bank in New York until the minimum is reached.    THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED  BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY STATE SECURITIES  COMMISSION NOR HAS THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR ANY STATE  SECURITIES COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS  PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE.    The offering price for the common stock has been arbitrarily  determined by us. The minimum subscription is 500,000 Shares and the  maximum subscription is 10,000,000 shares. Prior to this offering, there  has been no public market for the shares and there can be no assurance  that a regular trading market will develop for the shares after this  offering or that, if developed, any such market will be sustained. We  anticipate that trading of the shares will be conducted through what is  customarily known as the "pink sheets" and/ or on the National  Quotation Bureau's Over-The-Counter Electronic Bulletin Board (the  "Bulletin Board"). Any market for the shares which may result  will likely be less well developed than if the shares were traded on  NASDAQ or on an exchange. See "Risk Factors" and "The  Offering."    Our officers and directors may purchase the shares sold in the  offering under the same terms and conditions as the public investors.  Such purchases, if made, will be for investment purposes only and not  for redistribution. Such purchases may be made for the purpose of  closing the minimum offering.    UNTIL 90 DAYS AFTER THE DATE FUNDS AND SECURITIES ARE RELEASED FROM  THE ESCROW OR TRUST ACCOUNT, ALL DEALERS EFFECTING TRANSACTIONS IN THE  REGISTERED SECURITIES, WHETHER OR NOT PARTICIPATING IN THIS  DISTRIBUTION, MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELIVER A PROSPECTUS.

Summary 
  This summary highlights selected information from elsewhere in this  prospectus. It is not complete and may not contain all of the  information that is important to you. To understand this offering fully,  you should read the entire prospectus carefully, including the risk  factors and financial statements and the related notes to those  statements included in this prospectus.   
The Company                  Our corporate name is Gisser Automotive Concepts, 
                             Inc. We were incorporated in New York on May 22, 
                             1997 by our founder, Daryl K. Gisser. Mr. Gisser 
                             formed Gisser Automotive Concepts to capitalize on 
                             the increase in market demand in the luxury 
                             automobile market that began in 1997. 
                             We build the MEC4. The MEC4 is a hand-built, 
                             high-performance, mid-engine, superexotic sports 
                             coupe. Our mission is to design, engineer and 
                             manufacture the MEC4 superexotic luxury sports 
                             coupes to be highly marketable while satisfying the 
                             on-going demands of discriminating and affluent 
                             sophisticated sports car enthusiasts. 
                             Our principal executive offices are located at 52 
                             Edison Court, Monsey, N.Y. 10952 and our telephone 
                             number is (845) 356-8008. 
                             We are in the development stage and have no 
                             operating history. No representation is made or 
                             implied that we will be able to carry on our 
                             activities profitably. Our subsistence is dependent 
                             initially upon sufficient proceeds being realized by 
                             us from this offering, of which there is no 
                             assurance. Proceeds of this offering may be 
                             insufficient to enable us to conduct potentially 
                             profitable operations or otherwise to engage in any 
                             business endeavors. The likelihood of our success 
                             must be considered in light of the expenses, 
                             difficulties and delays frequently encountered in 
                             connection with the formation of any new business. 
                             Since the incorporation of Gisser Automotive 
                             Concepts, Inc., we have not generated any revenue. 
                             With limited financial resources, we may not be able 
                             to continue as a going concern. We have four 
                             officers, seven directors and four employees.

The Offering                 The Company is offering a maximum 10,000,000 shares 
                             of Common Stock, $.01 par value at an offering price 
                             of $1.00 per Share and a minimum of 500,000 shares. 
                             The full subscription price will be payable at the 
                             time of subscription. The minimum total amount 
                             associated with this Offering is $500,000.00, and 
                             accordingly, funds received from subscribers in this 
                             Offering will be released to the Company when 
                             subscriptions are received and accepted in the 
                             amount necessary to meet the minimum requirements. 
                             The Offering will expire on December 31, 2008, 
                             unless extended by the Company in its sole 
                             discretion. See "The Offering - Structure and Timing 
                             of the Offering." 
                             Unless otherwise indicated, the information in this 
                             prospectus, irrespective of the date referenced, 
                             assumes that there is no exercise of outstanding 
                             options or warrants to purchase additional shares. 
                             We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering 
                             to market the services the company currently offers 
                             and initiate new business development and 
                             relationships. We shall seek to employ qualified, 
                             but as yet unidentified, individuals to manage such 
                             business. No assurance can be given that the net 
                             proceeds of the maximum number of shares offered in 
                             this offering or any lesser net amount will be 
                             sufficient to accomplish our goals. In the event 
                             that substantially less than the net proceeds from 
                             the maximum offering are raised, our plans may be 
                             materially and adversely affected in that we may 
                             find it even more difficult, if not impossible, to 
                             realize our goals See "Risk Factors", "Use of 
                             Proceeds" and "Proposed Business." 
                             If proceeds from this offering are insufficient, we 
                             may be required to seek additional capital. No 
                             assurance can be given that we will be able to 
                             obtain such additional capital, or even if 
                             available, that such additional capital will be 
                             available on terms acceptable to us. 
Business                     The company builds the MEC4, America's first 
                             independent hand-built, high-performance, 
                             mid-engine, superexotic sports coupe. Our mission is 
                             to design, engineer and manufacture the MEC4 
                             superexotic luxury sports coupes to be highly 
                             marketable while satisfying the on-going demands of 
                             discriminating and affluent sophisticated sports car 
                             enthusiasts. The MEC4's price positioning limited 
                             production should enable the Company to gain a 
                             strategic market niche and in-turn create a backlog 
                             of orders. 
                             The company is striving to become an independent 
                             high-performance, automobile designer and 
                             manufacturer of mid-engine, superexotic, hand-built 
                             vehicles for the super-luxury and ultra-luxury 
                             market segments. We have designed and engineered our 
                             superexotic luxury sports coupe to be highly 
                             marketable and saleable to a maximum number of 
                             discriminating and affluent automobile buyers.

A fiberglass reinforced plastic body was employed 
                             rather than other materials due to its versatility 
                             and conformity in the complex and compound curves 
                             which comprise the unique style of the MEC4. Since 
                             the MEC4 is based on a modular rolling chassis, the 
                             body is completely unstressed by any demands of the 
                             vehicle's structural rigidity and therefore may 
                             remain lightweight. This allowed liberal 
                             distribution of the vehicle's total weight toward 
                             optimizing the structural rigidity and versatility 
                             of the chassis. Most classes of professional 
                             competition employ the very same configuration in 
                             their race car designs for state of the art 
                             performance and safety. 
Competition                  The GAC is positioning the MEC4 as an exclusive 
                             superexotic automobile that appeals to the affluent 
                             sophisticated buyer whose market can best be 
                             described as wealthy and knowledgeable about 
                             high-performance automobiles. The Company believes 
                             that its strategy of pricing the MEC4 superexotic 
                             sports coupe at $118,000 will give it an advantage 
                             in the market and places its vehicle in a category 
                             with few direct competitors yet potentially many 
                             ready consumers. By exhibiting the better 
                             performance and styling features of higher priced 
                             Exotic/Super-Luxury Automobiles, the MEC4 would be a 
                             superior value when placed alongside any other 
                             Ultra-Luxury/Prestige Sports Coupe in the lower 
                             priced market. Additional models will be offered 
                             over the spectrum of the market segment starting at 
                             $70,000. 
Current Financial Resources  We have engaged in no significant operations other 
                             than organizational activities, acquisition of 
                             capital and preparation for registration of our 
                             securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 
                             1934, as amended. No revenues were received by us 
                             since our formation. 
                             For the current fiscal year, we anticipate incurring 
                             a loss as a result of organizational expenses, 
                             expenses associated with registration under the 
                             Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and other expenses. 
Dependence on                The rate of growth of the Company is somewhat 
Additional Financing         dependent upon the successful completion of this 
                             Offering to commence its proposed plan of operation, 
                             and the Company may need additional financing to 
                             fund its corporate activities. Such financing may 
                             come from a variety of sources, including additional 
                             equity or debt offerings. No assurance can be given 
                             that any future financing, either equity or debt, 
                             will be available or, if available, that it can be 
                             obtained on terms acceptable to the Company. If such 
                             financing is required but is not available, the 
                             Company may be forced to significantly restrict, 
                             curtail or abandon its activities. This would have 
                             an adverse effect on the Company's business and 
                             financial condition. There can also be no assurance 
                             that the Company will survive as a viable commercial 
                             enterprise even if such additional financing is 
                             obtained. The issuance of any additional equity 
                             after the consummation of this Offering will dilute 
                             the ownership interests of the shareholders who 
                             purchase Shares in this Offering. See "Proposed 
                             Additional Transactions" and "Risk Factors - 
                             Dilution."

We believe that our existing capital will be 
                             sufficient to meet our cash needs, including the 
                             costs of compliance with the continuing reporting 
                             requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 
                             as amended, for a period of approximately one year. 
                             No commitments to provide additional funds have been 
                             made by management or other stockholders. 
                             Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any 
                             additional funds will be available to us to allow it 
                             to cover our expenses. 
                             Irrespective of whether our cash assets prove to be 
                             inadequate to meet our operational needs, we might 
                             seek to compensate providers of services by 
                             issuances of stock in lieu of cash. 
Risk Profile                 An investment in the Shares involves significant 
                             risks and is suitable only for persons of 
                             substantial financial means who have no need for 
                             liquidity from such investment. See "Risk Factors". 
                             In addition to the other information in this 
                             Memorandum, the following risk factors should be 
                             carefully considered in evaluating the Company and 
                             its business before purchasing the Shares offered 
                             herein. An investment in the Shares offered herein 
                             is speculative in nature and involves a high degree 
                             of risk. No investment in the Shares should be made 
                             by any person who is not in a position to lose the 
                             entire amount of the investment. 
Management                   The Company's CEO is Daryl K. Gisser, who has been 
                             our President and Chairman of the board of directors 
                             since our inception in 1997. Mr. Gisser has gained 
                             over 20 years of experience in autobody techniques. 
                             His expertise has progressed to steel fabrication, 
                             welding, fiberglass construction and thermoforming. 
                             Mr. Gisser's has hands on experience working with 
                             varied materials and has designed, engineered and 
                             built several fiberglass/composite vehicles. His 
                             varied expertise in automotive design development 
                             ranges from conceptual sketches and renderings to 
                             the execution of three-dimensional clay models, 
                             scale and full size, utilized as bucks in the 
                             creation of prototypes, molds and tooling for 
                             production.

Plan of Distribution         This is a direct participation, and with no 
                             commitment by anyone to purchase any shares. None of 
                             the officers and directors (a) is subject to a 
                             statutory disqualification (as defined in Sec. 
                             3(a)(35), (b) is paid commissions or other 
                             remuneration for securities transactions, or (c) is 
                             an associated person of a broker or dealer. The 
                             shares will be offered and sold on a "best efforts" 
                             basis by our principal executive officers and 
                             directors. We will amend the registration statement 
                             of which this Prospectus is a part following its 
                             effectiveness to identify a selected broker-dealer 
                             at such time as such broker-dealer sells shares 
                             offered in this offering. All proceeds from 
                             subscriptions to purchase shares will be transmitted 
                             by us and any participating dealer to the escrow 
                             account by noon of the next business day after 
                             receipt. The shares are offered by us on a "best 
                             efforts" 500,000 Share minimum, 10,000,000 Share 
                             maximum, basis. In the event that the minimum of 
                             500,000 shares is not sold by December 31, 2008, all 
                             proceeds raised will be returned promptly to 
                             subscribers in full with interest thereon. 
                             Subscribers will not be entitled to a return of 
                             funds from the escrow account during the offering 
                             period. 
Use of Proceeds              Assuming that the entire offering will be sold, then 
                             up to the last $75,000 that we raise will be used to 
                             pay the expenses of the offering after the escrow is 
                             released. We intend to apply substantially all of 
                             the net proceeds of this offering (other than the 
                             proceeds to be deposited into the escrow account) to 
                             build the prototype. See "Use of Proceeds," 
                             "Proposed Business" and "Certain Transactions." 
Risk Factors                 The shares offered hereby involve a high degree of 
                             risk and immediate substantial dilution and should 
                             not be purchased by investors who cannot afford the 
                             loss of their entire investment. Such risks include, 
                             among others: our short period of existence and 
                             limited resources; and the discretionary use of 
                             proceeds. See "Risk Factors," "Dilution" and "Use of 
                             Proceeds."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  Escrowed Funds Not to Be Used for Salaries or Reimbursable Expenses    No funds (including any interest earned thereon) will be disbursed  from the escrow account for the payment of salaries or reimbursement of  expenses incurred on our behalf by our officers and directors. Other  than the foregoing, there is no limit on the amount of such reimbursable  expenses, and there will be no review of the reasonableness of such  expenses by anyone other than our board of directors, all of whom are  officers. see "Risk Factors," "Use of Proceeds" and  "Certain Transactions."    Material Persons    Our officers, directors and major shareholders are the only persons  who have been instrumental in arranging our capitalization to date.  neither of our officers or directors are acting as nominee for any  persons or is otherwise under the control of any person or persons.  there are no agreements, agreements in principle, or understandings with  regard to compensation to be paid by us to any of our officers or  directors.    It is anticipated we may make sales of shares to officers and  directors and that such persons may purchase the shares offered hereby.  Such purchases shall be made for investment purposes only and in a  manner consistent with a public offering of our shares. Such purchases  may be used to reach the amount required for closing in the event such  amount is not reached as a result of purchases by the general public.  Thus the officers and directors could purchase up to 100% of the amount  required for closing if no sales are made to new shareholders. Such  purchases will increase the equity interests already owned by the  officers and directors.    Investors should carefully review the financial statements which  are an integral part of this prospectus.    Dealers participating in this offering are required to deliver a  copy of the final prospectus to any person who is expected to receive a  confirmation of the sale at least 48 hours prior to the mailing of the  confirmation.   
Risk Factors 
  The securities offered hereby are highly speculative and involve  substantial risks. You should carefully consider the risks and  uncertainties described below and the other information in this  prospectus before deciding whether to invest in shares of our common  stock. Any of the following risks could cause the value of our common  stock to decline.    Our financial status creates a doubt whether we will continue as a  going concern for more than 12 months from the date of this prospectus,  and, if we do not continue as a going concern, investors may lose their  entire investment.    We have nominal assets and limited operations with which to create  operating capital. We seek to raise additional capital to promote and  advertise our services in an offering of our common stock on Form S-1.  If all the shares offered are sold, we will receive up to $10,000,000  proceeds net of expenses to purchase material and equipment to build the  prototype. There can be no assurance that such offering will be  successful.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
We are a development stage company that has a very limited operating history; we 
never earned any revenues and we may never achieve or sustain profitability. 
  At October 31, 2008, we had shareholder's equity of $(361,374)  and a working capital deficit of $978,419. We were incorporated on May  22, 1997 and since then our only operations have consisted of research  and development and the building of prototypes of our mid-engine,  superexotic sports coupe, the MEC4. We have not yet commenced the  commercial sale of our product and have no revenues to date. We have  absolutely no track record upon which you can evaluate an investment in  our shares. We have a limited operating history and very limited  indications of product acceptability upon which an evaluation of our  proposed business can be based. Our ability to achieve profitable  operations is dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability  to become a successful market entrant, our ability to effectively  manufacture, market and distribute our MEC4 in commercial quantities,  our ability to expand our product base in the future, and our ability to  successfully market and sell our products. Furthermore, our revenues,  expenses and cash flow cannot be predicted with any certainty. Our  expenses will be variable based on market conditions and the number of  vehicles sold.    We only have $29,012 in cash as of October 31, 2008 and if we are  unable to raise more money we will be required to delay, scale back or  eliminate key elements of our business plan.    As of October 31, 2008, we had $29,012 in cash available to fund  our operations. Our cash requirements have been and will continue to be  significant. We anticipate, based on our present operating plan and  assumptions, that the maximum proceeds of this offering will be  sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least 12 calendar  months. However, the shares that are being offered by us under this  prospectus are being offered on a best efforts basis, so we may not be  able to sell the maximum number, or any particular number, of shares in  this offering and the net proceeds from any shares sold may not be  sufficient to allow us to accomplish our business objectives.    Further, if we are unable to raise any significant funds in this  offering, we will likely be required to seek additional capital from  other sources in the future through additional equity or debt financing  or credit facilities. Any additional equity financing that we obtain  will likely involve substantial dilution to our shareholders, and any  debt financing would increase the cost of our debt service requirements.  It will be difficult for us to obtain additional capital in the future  on acceptable terms or at all. To date, we have made attempts to  identify possible sources for funding but have no commitments for any  future funding. The type, timing and terms of such funding, if it is  available at all, will be determined by prevailing conditions in the  financial markets and our financial condition, among other factors. If  we cannot obtain the financing we need we may have to significantly  curtail or reduce our operations.    RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS    We may experience significant returns or warranty claims, which  would damage our brand, increase our costs and impair our ability to  achieve profitability.    Currently, the MEC4 is not available for purchase by the general  public. As a result, we have no meaningful data regarding the  performance or maintenance requirements of our product or any basis on  which we can estimate warranty costs. If we are subject to significant  warranty service requirements or product recalls, potential customers  may determine that our vehicles are unreliable and may choose not to  purchase them. Further, significant warranty service requirements will  result in increased costs to us as a result of the costs of repair or  replacement of our products and the costs associated with researching  and developing solutions to issues raised by warranty claims. Any  significant warranty service requirements or product recalls would  increase our costs materially and reduce the value of our brand  significantly.   
10 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  The marketing and sale of our products will be subject to  significant competition and most if not all of our competitors are  better capitalized and much more experienced than us.    Our superexotic automobiles compete in a segment of the automotive  market which is highly competitive in style and price. The principal  competitive factors affecting the market for our product include product  quality, appearance, design, price and distribution capabilities. We may  not be able to compete successfully against current and future  competitors based on these and other factors. Most of our current and  potential business competitors in Ultra and Super-Luxury market segments  have achieved a higher level of brand recognition than us, have longer  operating histories than us and significantly greater financial,  technical, production, distribution, marketing and other resources than  us, and could decide at any time to increase their resource commitments  in our planned markets. Our competitors include well known companies  such as Jaguar, Porsche, Ferrari, Mercedes and BMW. It is possible that  existing or future business competitors will develop programs that would  significantly impact our ability to compete in our intended market  niche.    We do not currently have a distribution channel for the sales of  our vehicle and we may not be able to obtain a good distribution channel  in the future.    We intend to market our product line through direct sales and the  establishment of independent sales representatives on a national and  international basis. We do not have any contractual arrangements with  any sales and/or authorized service representatives. Our inability to  contract with such sales and service representatives will have a  material adverse impact on the sales of our MEC4 and future products.  Moreover, even if we are able to reach an agreement with an independent  sales representative, we can't be sure that it will be on economic  terms that are satisfactory to us or that the sales representatives will  be able to successfully develop sales of our product and future  products.    Our operations may become subject to significant governmental  regulations in the future.    We are in the business of manufacturing motor vehicles. Automobile  manufacturers that build vehicles for sale in the United States are  regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the US  Department of Transportation which among their regulations include  environmental and licensing law requirements. Although we are a low  volume manufacturer that is not governed by the same regulations as mass  manufacturers and we utilize components from OEMs and aftermarket  suppliers that have been approved by both agencies for use, there can be  no assurance that these regulations will not change in the future.  Additionally, we may in the future and for undetermined reasons need to  use other components that have not yet been approved for use other than  racing or that are not intended for use on normal highways and roads.    Existing governmental regulations and/or the adoption of new, laws,  regulations or policies relating to the environment, safety, emissions  and/or fuel economy may have a significant impact on how we do business  as well as possible higher costs, cash expenditures, and/or sales  restrictions.    We and the automotive industry as a whole are governed by and  affected significantly by a substantial number of governmental  regulations, which vary by state, region and country. In our primary  market, the United States, governmental regulation has arisen primarily  out of concern for the environment, vehicle safety and the desire to  increase fuel economy. In the future, these government regulatory  requirements may also complicate our plans for global product  development and expansion and may result in substantial expenses that  could be unacceptable to our consumers. Costs may exceed $500,000 for  crash tests and the necessary approvals from the department of  transportation (DOT) in addition to the cost of any vehicles to be  tested. Meeting or exceeding the government mandated safety standards is  particularly costly since crashworthiness tends to conflict with weight  reduction goals in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards.  Other compliance issues with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  are not believed to be costly since our business plans include using EPA  tested and approved power plants that are already in production. Part of  our plans in bringing our vehicles into production was to use as many  off the shelf or approved components thereby reducing or eliminating  costs for governmental testing and new approvals. In addition, any new  government requirements that must be complied with during a product  cycle can be substantially more expensive than accommodating these  requirements prior to the design of a new product.

Daryl K. Gisser, our Chief Executive Officer, has the power to make all major 
decisions regarding the company without the need to get consent from any 
stockholder or other person. He is also the only person knowledgeable about our 
business, affairs and history and the loss of his services would likely result 
in the indefinite cessation of our operations and the complete failure of our 
current business plan. 
  Daryl Gisser owns 58.10% of the outstanding common and preferred  stock and he is our Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of our  board of directors. He, therefore, has the power to appoint and remove  directors, to make all major decisions regarding our affairs, including  decisions regarding whether or not to issue stock and for what  consideration, whether or not to sell all or substantially all of our  assets and for what consideration and whether or not to authorize more  stock for issuance or otherwise amend our charter or bylaws. He is in a  position to elect all of our directors and to dictate all of our  policies.    Furthermore, since Mr. Gisser is our founder, no other person  affiliated with, or employed by, us has the same extensive knowledge of  our day to day operations or any institutional knowledge regarding our  history and past affairs. We currently have an employment agreement with  Mr. Gisser as well as other certain key employees. The loss or inability  of Mr. Gisser to perform his duties would likely result in the  indefinite cessation of our operations and the complete failure of our  current business plan. We do currently maintain key man life insurance  coverage on Daryl K. Gisser's life in the amount of $1,000,000. We  do not maintain insurance on the life of our other executives. The  proceeds from any payout on the insurance on Mr. Gisser's life may  not be sufficient to allow us to continue operations in the event of his  death. We anticipate the hiring of new employees in connection with the  planned expansion of our business. Our future success will depend in  significant part on our ability to hire and retain key technical sales  and senior management personnel. Competition for such personnel is  intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in  attracting and retaining such personnel.    MARKET RISKS    No market exists for the trading of our securities and no market  may ever develop. Accordingly, you may not have any means of trading the  shares you acquire in this offering.    A market does not presently exist for our securities and no  assurance can be given that a market will ever develop. Consequently,  you may not be able to liquidate your investment in our securities for  an emergency or at any time, and the securities will not be readily  acceptable as collateral for loans. Although we may endeavor to  establish a trading market for our securities in the future, no  assurance can be given as to the timing of this event or whether the  market, if established, will be sufficiently liquid to enable an  investor to liquidate his investment in us.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  The application of the "penny stock" rules could  adversely affect the market for our stock.    The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 requires additional  disclosure relating to the market for "penny stocks." A penny  stock is generally defined to be any equity security not listed on  NASDAQ or a national securities exchange that has a market price of less  than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Among these  exceptions are shares issued by companies that have:    net tangible assets of at least $2 million, if the issuer has been  in continuous operation for three years;    net tangible assets of at least $5 million, if the issuer has been  in continuous operation for less than three years; or    average annual revenue of at least $6 million for each of the last  three years.    for our shares, and of any sales commissions or other compensation  payable to any broker or dealer, or any other related person, involved  in the transaction;    send monthly statements to buyers disclosing updated price  information for any penny stocks held in their accounts, and these  monthly statements must include specified information on the limited  market for penny stocks. We do not currently meet the requirements of  these exceptions and, therefore, our shares would be deemed penny stocks  for purposes of the Exchange Act if and at any time while our common  stock trades below $5.00 per share. In such case, trading in our shares  would be regulated pursuant to Rules 15-g-1 through 15-g-6 and 15-g-9 of  the Exchange Act. Under these rules, brokers or dealers recommending our  shares to prospective buyers would be required, unless an exemption is  available, to:    deliver a lengthy disclosure statement in a form designated by the  SEC relating to the penny stock market to any potential buyers, and  obtain a written acknowledgement from each buyer that such disclosure  statement has been received by the buyer prior to any transaction  involving our shares;    provide detailed written disclosure to buyers of current price  quotations    In addition, if we are subject to the penny stock rules, all  brokers or dealers involved in a transaction in which our shares are  sold to any buyer, other than an established customer or  "accredited investor," must make a special written  determination that our shares would be a suitable investment for the  buyer, and the brokers or dealers must receive the buyer's written  agreement to purchase our shares, as well as the buyer's written  acknowledgement that the suitability determination made by the broker or  dealer accurately reflects the buyer's financial situation,  investment experience and investment objectives, prior to completing any  transaction in our shares.    These Exchange Act rules may limit the ability or willingness of  brokers and other market participants to make a market in our shares and  may limit the ability of our shareholders to sell in the secondary  market, through brokers, dealers or otherwise. We also understand that  many brokerage firms will discourage their customers from trading in  shares falling within the "penny stock" definition due to the  added regulatory and disclosure burdens imposed by these Exchange Act  rules.    The SEC from time to time may propose and implement even more  stringent regulatory or disclosure requirements on shares not listed on  NASDAQ or on a national securities exchange. The adoption of the  proposed changes that may be made in the future could have an adverse  effect on the trading market for our shares.
