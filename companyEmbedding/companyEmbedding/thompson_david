The durability of a business is only as strong as the bonds between people, teams, and companies. Conversation, active listening and honest feedback are the basis of any relationship, and our business has the objective of helping people achieve their goals through building solid and long-lasting bonds.My name is David Thompson, and as a principal in ProForma, I help you partner with some of the best-in-class specialists in the world. The biggest challenge for marketing departments today is a lack of resources needed to find leads, and to receive and work bids. We help companies partner differently and smarter for marketing services, which gives them back time and resources without making sacrifices in price, quantity and service.Over the last ten years, marketing has changed rapidly and with the dramatic evolution in technology, this progression continues at an ever-increasing pace. Sometimes this involves looking at older methods such as direct marketing to gain attention, and at other times, the newest forms of social media networking and video advertising are needed.Our responsibility is to help you, our customer, achieve your goals and objectives. There are five areas we look at to find the best solution for you and your business.✔ Determine your goal and objective✔ Define your target audience✔ Get the theme✔ Determine the distribution method✔ Find out your budgetWe operate differently than our competitors, who typically will try and sell you mugs, pencils, yardsticks and calendars without thoroughly understanding what you’re attempting to accomplish. We do far more than try and sell you the latest gizmo; we take pains to know the best way to help you achieve your goals, reach your target audience, and fit within your budget.Please reach out to me to discuss your challenge or connect with me on LinkedIn.david.Thompson@proforma.comTX (972)497 2046CO (303) 683 0327ExperiencePrincipal ►Project Management ♦ Relationship Management ♦ Product Launch MarketingProformaSeptember 1998  –  Present (18 years 11 months)With an incredible network of over 500 of the best specialists, ProForma helps companies partner in different and smarter ways for marketing services. We have been helping businesses since 1978, and our extensive network keeps getting bigger and better. To ensure the highest quality, getting into our network is difficult and remaining is harder due to extreme competition.My role at ProForma is to help B2B and B2C customers get the right message in front of the correct prospects in such a way that the services and products are unforgettable. Doing this helps Sales Work Faster and Marketing Work Smarter. We save our clients an immense amount of time by managing the project from end to end, intelligently using outsourcing when needed, and because of our extensive network, providing the resources necessary to get the job done.Even with our top-of-the-line service, we reduce our client’s costs, provide preferred pricing and service and meet the CPSIA standard. You can be assured that we will work within your budget and still provide the best possible service.Please feel free to reach out to me to discuss your challenges, whether you have a major initiative or a day-to-day issue. We can tackle any size project regardless of how small or how large and deliver excellent results.david.Thompson@proforma.comTX (972)497 2046CO (303) 683 0327Principal ►Sales and Marketing ♦ Maximize Performance ♦ RelationshipsProformaSeptember 1998  –  Present (18 years 11 months)All businesses, large and small, must have effective, purposeful communication to thrive and prosper. Pro forma begins with advertising, which is a discipline of communication, and continues through all aspects of sales and marketing.Your business faces a large number of communication challenges and opportunities on a regular basis:✔ Acquiring and retaining key accounts✔ Generating traffic and following up leads from trade shows✔ Providing training programs and awards for sales, product, and procedure initiatives✔ Maintaining awareness of internal safety issues and opportunities✔ Communicating with employees and maintaining compliance✔ Celebrating corporate anniversaries and milestones✔ Introducing and promoting products✔ Controlling, reaching and influencing channel partners✔ Giving performance (premium) promotions for businesses, customers and employees✔ Branding initiatives✔ Print collateral production✔ Creating programs to generate mailing lists✔ Combining one or more of these applicationsWhile this list is not exhaustive, it illustrates the many programs and initiatives that ProForma can help you in achieving your success. We apply many different media to help you achieve your goals, but our focus is with the dimensional medium known as promotional products.Sales And MarketingPurolator CourierFebruary 1992  –  October 1995 (3 years 9 months)Toronto, Canada AreaPurolator Courier - Toronto CanadaI was responsible for Sales in a downtown Toronto Territory.Canadian Sales & MarketingUtilX Corporation1989  –  1992 (3 years)I was responsible for setting up and managing a Canadian sales division for marketing of underground renovation products and services to the Utility industries in Canada.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Dr. David Thompson is on call.  First came the call of God to medical missions; then a phone call announced the brutal murder of David's parents at the hands of the Viet Cong. Later another call carried the determined missionary kid through medical school. Today, David Thompson responds to the persistent calls of the sick and dying at the Bongolo Mission Hospital in Gabon, West Africa.


Author Bio▼▲
DAVID THOMPSON was born in the U.S. but grew up in Cambodia where his parents worked for 16 years. When he was 14 he and his father tried unsuccessfully to save a Cambodian man who was seriously injured when a truck and a bus collided. God used the incident to plant in David's young heart a desire to become a doctor and help people who had limited access to healthcare. David graduated from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1973 with a M.D. degree and eventually completed five years of residency in general surgery in southern California. In 1977 he and his wife Rebecca moved to Gabon, Africa and for the next 34 years built a 150-bed full-service hospital to provide medical services to Gabon's least served provinces. In 1966, Dr. Thompson helped establish the Pan-African Academy of Christian Surgeons (PAACS), an organization that trains African surgeons at Christian hospitals throughout the continent. Since 2014, Dr. Thompson has been working as a volunteer to train Egyptian surgeons at Harpur Memorial Hospital.
