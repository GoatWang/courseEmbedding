Robert L. Johnson, in full Robert Louis Johnson  (born April 8, 1946, Hickory, Miss., U.S.), American businessman, founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET), and the first African American majority owner of a major professional sports team in the United States.Johnson grew up in Freeport, Ill., as the 9th of 10 children. He majored in history at the University of Illinois (B.A., 1968) and, after studying public affairs at Princeton University (M.A., 1972), moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Urban League. He began cultivating valuable political and business connections that later helped him bankroll his vision of creating a black-owned cable television company. As a lobbyist for the nascent cable industry from 1976 to 1979, he noticed that the large African American TV audience was going unrecognized and untapped. Johnson built BET from a tiny cable outlet, airing only two hours of programming a week in 1980, to a broadcasting giant that claimed an audience of more than 70 million households.In 1991 BET became the first black-controlled company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. BET thrived in the 1990s, adding more cable channels and expanding its reach through new film and publishing divisions, music channels, and a Web site. Viewership expanded along with the product line, while major media companies began to invest in the growing network. After taking BET private again in 1998, Johnson and his partners sold BET Holdings to the giant media group Viacom in 2001 for some $3 billion, though he remained at BET as its chief executive officer until 2005. The sale made him the first African American billionaire. Johnson then formed the umbrella group RLJ Companies, which operated widely in the media, sports, gaming, real estate, and hospitality industries.After attempting to purchase a National Basketball Association franchise throughout the 1990s, Johnson was approved as the owner of an expansion team in Charlotte, N.C., in 2003 (the city’s former team, the Hornets, had just moved to New Orleans, La.). The new team, called the Bobcats, began competition in 2004. Johnson’s purchase of the franchise, estimated at $300 million, also included the Sting, the Women’s National Basketball Association team in Charlotte. Johnson launched C-SET (Carolinas Sports Entertainment Network), a regional sports and entertainment cable TV network, in October 2004. In 2006 Johnson, along with the film producers Harvey Weinstein and Bob Weinstein, created the company Our Stories Films to develop family-oriented movies aimed at African American audiences. In 2007 RLJ Companies, international development and humanitarian aid organization CHF International, and the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation—an independent government agency created in 1971 to aid overseas investments and promote economic development in newly emerging markets—established the Liberian Enterprise Development Finance Company to promote investment and project development in Liberia.

Early life and education[edit]
Johnson was born in 1946 in Hickory, Mississippi, the Tenth out of Seventeen children to Edna and Archie Johnson.[3][4] His mother was a schoolteacher and his father a farmer.[3] His parents moved the family to Freeport, Illinois when he was a child.[3] He attended High School, where he was an honors student.[3][4] Johnson graduated from the University of Illinois in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in social studies.[3][4] While at the University of Illinois, Johnson was a member of the Beta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.[4] He received a master's degree in public affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University in 1972.[3][4]
Business career[edit]
After graduating Princeton he found a job in Washington, D.C. that introduced him to the television industry. He served as the public affairs director for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In this position is where he learned of the power and untapped potential of television. Around the same time he also worked as the director of communications for the Washington, D.C. office of the National Urban League.[10] Johnson worked as a press secretary for Congressman Walter E. Fauntroy.[4][11][12] He later became vice president of government relations at the National Cable and Television Association.[4][11][12] In 1980, Johnson launched Black Entertainment Television.[4][11]
Black Entertainment Television[edit]
Johnson left NCTA in 1979 to create Black Entertainment Television, the first cable television network aimed at African-Americans.[11][13] When the network launched in 1980, it only aired for two hours on Friday night.[4][11] BET first turned a profit in 1985 and it became the first black-controlled company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991.[11][13] In 1998, Johnson and Liberty Media bought all outstanding shares of the company.[13][14] This purchase gave Johnson 42% of the company.[13][14] Viacom acquired BET in 2000 for a reported $3 billion.[3][11][13] Johnson remained BET CEO until 2006.[11]
The RLJ Companies[edit]
Johnson founded The RLJ Companies, a holding company with a diverse portfolio including hotel real estate investment; private equity; financial services; asset management; automobile dealerships; sports and entertainment; and Video Lottery Terminal (VLT) gaming.[3][15] The RLJ Companies is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland; with affiliate offices operating in Charlotte, North Carolina; Little Rock, Arkansas; Los Angeles, California; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Monrovia, Liberia.[16]
Other ventures[edit]
As of 2013, Johnson was a member of the board of directors for RLJ Lodging Trust, RLJ Entertainment, Inc., KB Home, Lowe’s Companies, Inc., Strayer Education, Think Finance, Inc., NBA Board of Governors, The Business Council, and the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.[15][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] Johnson has also served as a member of the board of directors for several other companies and organizations, including US Airways, Hilton Hotels, General Mills, the United Negro College Fund, and Deutsche Bank’s Americas Advisory Board.[15][24][25][26][27][28]
Johnson became the first African-American majority club owner of a major American sports league with his 2002 purchase of the Charlotte Bobcats.[8][29][30] In 2010, Johnson sold his majority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats to Michael Jordan.[31]
Philanthropy and activism[edit]
In 2011, Johnson worked with Morgan Freeman to raise funds for hurricane preparedness in the Bahamas.[32] Johnson released a neckwear line in coordination with PVH and The Ella Rose Collection, the RLJ Ella Rose Africa Tie Collection, in 2012 to benefit the charitable organization Malaria No More.[33]
In 2007, Johnson created the Liberia Enterprise Development Fund with a $30 million investment.[5][34][35] The fund provides credit for Liberian entrepreneurs.[5]
In January 2008, Johnson became the target of criticism for remarks he made to supporters of Hillary Clinton about Barack Obama.[36][37]
Johnson said, "As an African-American, I'm frankly insulted that the Obama campaign would imply that we are so stupid that we would think Bill and Hillary Clinton, who have been deeply and emotionally involved in black issues when Barack Obama was doing something in the neighborhood that I won't say what he was doing, [but] he said it in his book."[36] This statement was widely interpreted as a criticism of Obama's acknowledged use of marijuana in his youth. The Clinton campaign denied this, submitting that the comments were referring to Obama's work as a community organizer.[38] In subsequent days, Johnson was roundly criticized for his comments as hypocritical given the prodigious glorification of drug use and sale by artists prominently featured on BET.[39]
On January 17, 2008, Johnson sent Obama the following apology:[40]

I'm writing to apologize to you and your family personally for the un-called-for comments I made at a recent Clinton event. In my zeal to support Senator Clinton, I made some very inappropriate remarks for which I am truly sorry. I hope that you will accept this apology. Good luck on the campaign trail.

On April 14, 2008, Johnson made comments to the effect that Obama would not be the Democratic Party's leading candidate if he were not black, in support of the prior statement made by Geraldine Ferraro. He also went on to say "I make a joke about Obama doing drugs (and it's) 'Oh my God, a black man tearing down another black man.' "[41]
Personal life[edit]
Johnson married Sheila Johnson in 1969.[3] They divorced in 2001 and have two children.[42] Johnson began dating Lauren Wooden in 2010. As of 2016, Wooden is pursuing an international business-management doctorate in Paris.[43] They married in May 2016.[44] Greg Mathis officiated.[44]

Early life and education[edit]
Johnson was born in 1946 in Hickory, Mississippi, the Tenth out of Seventeen children to Edna and Archie Johnson.[3][4] His mother was a schoolteacher and his father a farmer.[3] His parents moved the family to Freeport, Illinois when he was a child.[3] He attended High School, where he was an honors student.[3][4] Johnson graduated from the University of Illinois in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in social studies.[3][4] While at the University of Illinois, Johnson was a member of the Beta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.[4] He received a master's degree in public affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University in 1972.[3][4]
Business career[edit]
After graduating Princeton he found a job in Washington, D.C. that introduced him to the television industry. He served as the public affairs director for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In this position is where he learned of the power and untapped potential of television. Around the same time he also worked as the director of communications for the Washington, D.C. office of the National Urban League.[10] Johnson worked as a press secretary for Congressman Walter E. Fauntroy.[4][11][12] He later became vice president of government relations at the National Cable and Television Association.[4][11][12] In 1980, Johnson launched Black Entertainment Television.[4][11]
Black Entertainment Television[edit]
Johnson left NCTA in 1979 to create Black Entertainment Television, the first cable television network aimed at African-Americans.[11][13] When the network launched in 1980, it only aired for two hours on Friday night.[4][11] BET first turned a profit in 1985 and it became the first black-controlled company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991.[11][13] In 1998, Johnson and Liberty Media bought all outstanding shares of the company.[13][14] This purchase gave Johnson 42% of the company.[13][14] Viacom acquired BET in 2000 for a reported $3 billion.[3][11][13] Johnson remained BET CEO until 2006.[11]
The RLJ Companies[edit]
Johnson founded The RLJ Companies, a holding company with a diverse portfolio including hotel real estate investment; private equity; financial services; asset management; automobile dealerships; sports and entertainment; and Video Lottery Terminal (VLT) gaming.[3][15] The RLJ Companies is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland; with affiliate offices operating in Charlotte, North Carolina; Little Rock, Arkansas; Los Angeles, California; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Monrovia, Liberia.[16]
Other ventures[edit]
As of 2013, Johnson was a member of the board of directors for RLJ Lodging Trust, RLJ Entertainment, Inc., KB Home, Lowe’s Companies, Inc., Strayer Education, Think Finance, Inc., NBA Board of Governors, The Business Council, and the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.[15][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] Johnson has also served as a member of the board of directors for several other companies and organizations, including US Airways, Hilton Hotels, General Mills, the United Negro College Fund, and Deutsche Bank’s Americas Advisory Board.[15][24][25][26][27][28]
Johnson became the first African-American majority club owner of a major American sports league with his 2002 purchase of the Charlotte Bobcats.[8][29][30] In 2010, Johnson sold his majority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats to Michael Jordan.[31]
Philanthropy and activism[edit]
In 2011, Johnson worked with Morgan Freeman to raise funds for hurricane preparedness in the Bahamas.[32] Johnson released a neckwear line in coordination with PVH and The Ella Rose Collection, the RLJ Ella Rose Africa Tie Collection, in 2012 to benefit the charitable organization Malaria No More.[33]
In 2007, Johnson created the Liberia Enterprise Development Fund with a $30 million investment.[5][34][35] The fund provides credit for Liberian entrepreneurs.[5]
In January 2008, Johnson became the target of criticism for remarks he made to supporters of Hillary Clinton about Barack Obama.[36][37]
Johnson said, "As an African-American, I'm frankly insulted that the Obama campaign would imply that we are so stupid that we would think Bill and Hillary Clinton, who have been deeply and emotionally involved in black issues when Barack Obama was doing something in the neighborhood that I won't say what he was doing, [but] he said it in his book."[36] This statement was widely interpreted as a criticism of Obama's acknowledged use of marijuana in his youth. The Clinton campaign denied this, submitting that the comments were referring to Obama's work as a community organizer.[38] In subsequent days, Johnson was roundly criticized for his comments as hypocritical given the prodigious glorification of drug use and sale by artists prominently featured on BET.[39]
On January 17, 2008, Johnson sent Obama the following apology:[40]

I'm writing to apologize to you and your family personally for the un-called-for comments I made at a recent Clinton event. In my zeal to support Senator Clinton, I made some very inappropriate remarks for which I am truly sorry. I hope that you will accept this apology. Good luck on the campaign trail.

On April 14, 2008, Johnson made comments to the effect that Obama would not be the Democratic Party's leading candidate if he were not black, in support of the prior statement made by Geraldine Ferraro. He also went on to say "I make a joke about Obama doing drugs (and it's) 'Oh my God, a black man tearing down another black man.' "[41]
Personal life[edit]
Johnson married Sheila Johnson in 1969.[3] They divorced in 2001 and have two children.[42] Johnson began dating Lauren Wooden in 2010. As of 2016, Wooden is pursuing an international business-management doctorate in Paris.[43] They married in May 2016.[44] Greg Mathis officiated.[44]

Johnson said, "As an African-American, I'm frankly insulted that the Obama campaign would imply that we are so stupid that we would think Bill and Hillary Clinton, who have been deeply and emotionally involved in black issues when Barack Obama was doing something in the neighborhood that I won't say what he was doing, [but] he said it in his book."[36] This statement was widely interpreted as a criticism of Obama's acknowledged use of marijuana in his youth. The Clinton campaign denied this, submitting that the comments were referring to Obama's work as a community organizer.[38] In subsequent days, Johnson was roundly criticized for his comments as hypocritical given the prodigious glorification of drug use and sale by artists prominently featured on BET.[39]
On January 17, 2008, Johnson sent Obama the following apology:[40]

I'm writing to apologize to you and your family personally for the un-called-for comments I made at a recent Clinton event. In my zeal to support Senator Clinton, I made some very inappropriate remarks for which I am truly sorry. I hope that you will accept this apology. Good luck on the campaign trail.

On April 14, 2008, Johnson made comments to the effect that Obama would not be the Democratic Party's leading candidate if he were not black, in support of the prior statement made by Geraldine Ferraro. He also went on to say "I make a joke about Obama doing drugs (and it's) 'Oh my God, a black man tearing down another black man.' "[41]
Personal life[edit]
Johnson married Sheila Johnson in 1969.[3] They divorced in 2001 and have two children.[42] Johnson began dating Lauren Wooden in 2010. As of 2016, Wooden is pursuing an international business-management doctorate in Paris.[43] They married in May 2016.[44] Greg Mathis officiated.[44]

Early life and education[edit]
Johnson was born in 1946 in Hickory, Mississippi, the Tenth out of Seventeen children to Edna and Archie Johnson.[3][4] His mother was a schoolteacher and his father a farmer.[3] His parents moved the family to Freeport, Illinois when he was a child.[3] He attended High School, where he was an honors student.[3][4] Johnson graduated from the University of Illinois in 1968 with a bachelor's degree in social studies.[3][4] While at the University of Illinois, Johnson was a member of the Beta chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.[4] He received a master's degree in public affairs from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University in 1972.[3][4]
Business career[edit]
After graduating Princeton he found a job in Washington, D.C. that introduced him to the television industry. He served as the public affairs director for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In this position is where he learned of the power and untapped potential of television. Around the same time he also worked as the director of communications for the Washington, D.C. office of the National Urban League.[10] Johnson worked as a press secretary for Congressman Walter E. Fauntroy.[4][11][12] He later became vice president of government relations at the National Cable and Television Association.[4][11][12] In 1980, Johnson launched Black Entertainment Television.[4][11]
Black Entertainment Television[edit]
Johnson left NCTA in 1979 to create Black Entertainment Television, the first cable television network aimed at African-Americans.[11][13] When the network launched in 1980, it only aired for two hours on Friday night.[4][11] BET first turned a profit in 1985 and it became the first black-controlled company listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991.[11][13] In 1998, Johnson and Liberty Media bought all outstanding shares of the company.[13][14] This purchase gave Johnson 42% of the company.[13][14] Viacom acquired BET in 2000 for a reported $3 billion.[3][11][13] Johnson remained BET CEO until 2006.[11]
The RLJ Companies[edit]
Johnson founded The RLJ Companies, a holding company with a diverse portfolio including hotel real estate investment; private equity; financial services; asset management; automobile dealerships; sports and entertainment; and Video Lottery Terminal (VLT) gaming.[3][15] The RLJ Companies is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland; with affiliate offices operating in Charlotte, North Carolina; Little Rock, Arkansas; Los Angeles, California; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Monrovia, Liberia.[16]
Other ventures[edit]
As of 2013, Johnson was a member of the board of directors for RLJ Lodging Trust, RLJ Entertainment, Inc., KB Home, Lowe’s Companies, Inc., Strayer Education, Think Finance, Inc., NBA Board of Governors, The Business Council, and the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.[15][17][18][19][20][21][22][23] Johnson has also served as a member of the board of directors for several other companies and organizations, including US Airways, Hilton Hotels, General Mills, the United Negro College Fund, and Deutsche Bank’s Americas Advisory Board.[15][24][25][26][27][28]
Johnson became the first African-American majority club owner of a major American sports league with his 2002 purchase of the Charlotte Bobcats.[8][29][30] In 2010, Johnson sold his majority stake in the Charlotte Bobcats to Michael Jordan.[31]
Philanthropy and activism[edit]
In 2011, Johnson worked with Morgan Freeman to raise funds for hurricane preparedness in the Bahamas.[32] Johnson released a neckwear line in coordination with PVH and The Ella Rose Collection, the RLJ Ella Rose Africa Tie Collection, in 2012 to benefit the charitable organization Malaria No More.[33]
In 2007, Johnson created the Liberia Enterprise Development Fund with a $30 million investment.[5][34][35] The fund provides credit for Liberian entrepreneurs.[5]
In January 2008, Johnson became the target of criticism for remarks he made to supporters of Hillary Clinton about Barack Obama.[36][37]
Johnson said, "As an African-American, I'm frankly insulted that the Obama campaign would imply that we are so stupid that we would think Bill and Hillary Clinton, who have been deeply and emotionally involved in black issues when Barack Obama was doing something in the neighborhood that I won't say what he was doing, [but] he said it in his book."[36] This statement was widely interpreted as a criticism of Obama's acknowledged use of marijuana in his youth. The Clinton campaign denied this, submitting that the comments were referring to Obama's work as a community organizer.[38] In subsequent days, Johnson was roundly criticized for his comments as hypocritical given the prodigious glorification of drug use and sale by artists prominently featured on BET.[39]
On January 17, 2008, Johnson sent Obama the following apology:[40]

I'm writing to apologize to you and your family personally for the un-called-for comments I made at a recent Clinton event. In my zeal to support Senator Clinton, I made some very inappropriate remarks for which I am truly sorry. I hope that you will accept this apology. Good luck on the campaign trail.

On April 14, 2008, Johnson made comments to the effect that Obama would not be the Democratic Party's leading candidate if he were not black, in support of the prior statement made by Geraldine Ferraro. He also went on to say "I make a joke about Obama doing drugs (and it's) 'Oh my God, a black man tearing down another black man.' "[41]
Personal life[edit]
Johnson married Sheila Johnson in 1969.[3] They divorced in 2001 and have two children.[42] Johnson began dating Lauren Wooden in 2010. As of 2016, Wooden is pursuing an international business-management doctorate in Paris.[43] They married in May 2016.[44] Greg Mathis officiated.[44]

The network has continued to grow since that time, reaching tens of millions of homes and expanding to include other traditional and digital channels. In 2000, Viacom announced plans to purchase BET. The sale was finalized the following year and Johnson’s majority stake earned him more than $1 billion, making him the richest African American in the United States at that time as well as the first African-American billionaire. Johnson continued to be the company’s chairman and CEO for several years before leaving BET to lead the RLJ Companies. Johnson developed the RLJ Companies following the sale of BET to Viacom. RLJ is a holding company and asset management firm handling a portfolio of companies in the financial services, real estate, hospitality, professional sports, film production, automotive and gaming industries. Johnson has referred to RLJ as his “second act.” Johnson has invested in several notable companies and organizations beyond the reach of RLJ. He was the first African-American principal owner of a North American major-league sports franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats. In 2006, Johnson founded Our Stories Films with partner Harvey Weinstein. The company focuses on family-friendly movies intended for African-American audiences. In 2011, Our Stories released the romantic-comedy feature Jumping the Broom. In addition to his business ventures, Johnson has involved himself in politics. In 2007, Johnson organized a tour of African-American business leaders to Liberia. This trip led to the creation of the Liberia Enterprise Development Fund. Johnson publicly called for African-American support of Liberia, on the model of Jewish support for Israel. Johnson received criticism for his rebuke of Barack Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary election, in favor of Hillary Clinton.Personal LifeJohnson was married to Sheila Johnson from 1969 to 2002. The couple, who cofounded BET, divorced a year after selling the network to Viacom. They have two children. Sheila Johnson received one of the largest documented settlements in United States history and subsequently married the judge who presided over the divorce proceedings.Fact CheckWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

Johnson, Robert Louis (1946 - )

Image Ownership: Public Domain




Robert Louis Johnson, founder, chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Black Entertainment Television (BET), is also the majority owner of the Charlotte (North Carolina) Bobcats of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the first African American billionaire. He was born in Hickory, Mississippi in 1946 as the ninth of 10 children.  After his family relocated to Freeport, Illinois, Johnson earned a Bachelor of Arts in History at the University of Illinois in 1968. He also received a Masters in Public Administration from Princeton University in New Jersey in 1972. 


Johnson then moved to Washington D.C. where he worked for both the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Urban League. In 1976, Johnson became the vice president of governmental relations for the National Cable Television Association (NCTA), an organization comprised of various cable television companies. 


Johnson’s work with NCTA inspired him to develop television programming that was dedicated to African American viewers who at that time were unrecognized as a target audience group. He initially borrowed $15,000 from the president of the NCTA, Tom Wheeler, to fund his plan of gaining a black viewership in television. Later, he persuaded John Malone, the president of Telecommunications, Inc., to invest $500,000 in the project. 


BET first aired in January 1980 and its content primarily consisted of black films from the 1940s and 1950s. Later, with the development of Music Television (MTV), music videos became ingrained in the popular media and BET promoted black rhythm and blues and hip hop artists. Even though BET only aired for a few hours each day in its early years, it quickly developed into an influential medium for African American self-expression and racial pride within American popular culture. After increasing air time to 24 hours a day, BET soon claimed an audience of over 70 million households.  It had also grown large enough to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1991. 


Although BET thrived in the 1990s by expanding its viewership and product line, Johnson decided to take the company private in 1998. In 2001, he sold BET to Viacom for $3 billion, making Johnson the first black billionaire. He retained his position as the CEO of BET until 2005 and afterward formed the Robert L. Johnson companies, a conglomerate of firms that worked in financial services, hospitality, real estate, film production, professional sports, gaming, and recording industries. In 2003, Johnson purchased ownership of the Charlotte Bobcats, a North Carolina basketball team and the following year he  launched a regional sports and entertainment television network. Today he is most famous for his promotion and dissemination of late twentieth century forms of black cultural expression.

                Worked on my case in 2014. While handling my case, communication was horrible and he continually made mistakes. Once I fired him and my case settled, he requested more money than the attorney who got my case settled. Definitely stay away from him and Sellars, Marion, and Bachi law firm.
