From Benjamin Franklin to Bill Gates, this ranking of the one hundred richest Americans, past and present, offers surprising portraits of these individuals and how they amassed their fortunes. The Vanderbilts, the Astors, Howard Hughes, John D. Rockefeller, Warren Buffett - their fascainting stories are here, great reading for anyone, regardless of financial stature.

                           "Most global businesses focus on selling to the wealthiest fourteen percent of the world's population: the developed world.
                              But these markets are oversaturated, overcompetitive, and aging. The 86 Percent Solution shows how to unleash new growth and
                              profitability by serving everyone else." "Drawing on dozens of examples from emerging markets worldwide, the authors offer
                              actionable strategies and tactics for product design, pricing, packaging, distribution, advertising, and much more. You'll
                              discover the radically different "rules of engagement" that make emerging markets tick, and how some companies are already
                              driving billions of dollars in sales there." "Along the way, you'll learn how to handle lack of infrastructure and media,
                              low literacy levels, and "unconventional" consumer behavior. With the right solutions, these challenges present opportunities."--Jacket

                           Knees weaken, voices quiver, and sweat glands go into overdrive at the mere thought of having to speak in public. Now, finally,
                              I'd Rather Die than Give a Speech! presents a method that is sure to make public speaking easier and more enjoyable. This
                              step-by-step game plan will help anyone transform speechmaking from a teeth-chattering ordeal to a rewarding experience that
                              can benefit their career and company. With practical tools and strategies for both speech preparers and presenters alike,
                              this handbook offers new ways to grab and hold an audience's attention, including all about ear appeal, which can turn lackluster
                              speeches into knockouts; covers the entire process of speechmaking - from preparation to performance to Q & A - in a lively,
                              easy-to-read style; includes chapter checklists and pitfalls to be avoided; and contains examples and anecdotes that are easy
                              to relate to and fun to read. I'd Rather Die than Give a Speech shows you how to craft and deliver a speech that grabs the
                              audience's attention and holds it through the barrage of questions that often follow presentations

                              In America, while all men and women may be created equal, they do not all end up that way. This book ranks an elite group:
                                 the richest Americans in American history. The Wealthy 100 offers intimate, often surprising portraits of these individuals
                                 and how they amassed their fortunes. The rankings are based on estimated total wealth at the time of death - or a given year
                                 for current living Americans - as a percentage of the Gross National Product (GNP) in current dollars for that year. This
                                 allows the authors to compare the fortunes of people from different centuries

                              Today's consumer is a centaur: a new hybrid who's mastering the latest technologies, but is still driven by age-old human
                                 desires and motivations. "Cyberconsumer" business models ignored human reality: that's why they failed. But "back-to-basics"
                                 ignores the deep changes the Internet has wrought. The genie's out of the bottle: your customers have profoundly new expectations
                                 -- and you have powerful new tools for delivering on them. Convergence Marketing Strategy illuminates the "centaur," showing
                                 what today's customers can do, what they're choosing to do, how they're evolving, and where they're headed. Jerry Wind and
                                 Vijay Mahajan identify "5Cs" at the heart of the new consumer relationship: customerization, community, channels, competitive
                                 value propositions, and choice tools. You'll discover strategies and tactics for responding right now -- and a complete framework
                                 for refocusing processes, structure, people, incentives, and technology to serve the centaur tomorrow
