History[edit]
The company was founded in 1970 by Bruce Thompson and Frederic D. Wolfe as the first healthcare focused real estate investment trust (REIT). The REIT structure is a tax status that allows commercial real estate income to pass through to shareholders without being taxed at the corporate level.[1] The company was led by George Chapman from 1996 to 2014, when he retired and was succeeded by Thomas DeRosa.[6] DeRosa served on the board for many years before becoming CEO; he has been associated with the company since 1992. DeRosa previously worked as vice chairman and chief financial officer of the Rouse Company before it merged with General Growth Properties.[7]
Originally named Health Care Fund, the company changed its name to Health Care REIT in 1985. Health Care REIT became Welltower in September 2015.[8] The company says its latest name change reflects shifts in its business model and distinguishes it from others in its category.[9]
The 2008 passage of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act (RIDEA) prompted a significant change in the company's business model. Prior to RIDEA, healthcare REITs were required to hold their assets under triple-net leases that limited their role primarily to collecting rent. RIDEA allowed healthcare REITs to participate in the actual net operating income of their properties subject to certain requirements such as using a third-party management firm. As of 2015, the company held 35% of its portfolio in RIDEA-structured investments and 27% in properties under triple-net leases.[10]
Welltower stock trades under the symbol "HCN" on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Welltower relies heavily on institutional funds to provide capital through public debt and equity markets.[7] As of early 2016, Welltower had a market capitalization of $24 billion. This is up from $150 million in 1992.[11]
Welltower is based in Toledo, Ohio where it maintains a 160-acre campus. As of 2015, it had almost 500 employees. About 200 of them work at its headquarters in Toledo. Welltower also has offices in Jupiter, Florida; Beverly Hills, California; London; and Toronto.[9] Welltower has about 1,400 properties in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Most of its properties in Canada and the United Kingdom are close to Toronto and London respectively.[7]
Acquisitions and developments[edit]
The company's acquisitions since 2011 were part of a broader market trend towards purchases of large property portfolios. During that year, publicly traded REITs and operators did 94 deals with a total transaction value of $24.5 billion.[12] In 2011, HCN acquired nearly all the real estate assets of Genesis HealthCare for $2.4 billion. The transaction included 147 properties including post-acute, skilled nursing, and assisted living facilities in 11 states. Genesis continues to operate the properties.[13]
HCN formed a partnership valued at $890 million with Benchmark Senior Living that was announced in February 2011 and closed in March of the same year. The partnership included 34 private-pay senior housing complexes. In January 2015, the company acquired nine Benchmark Senior Living complexes located in New England for $360 million.[14][15]
The company invested about $5 billion in 2012; it primarily targeted private-pay senior housing and medical office buildings. This included spending $530 million buying assets from Belmont Village Senior Living and $240 million on a property portfolio from Brookdale Senior Living.[16]
On January 8, 2013, the company acquired nearly all the real estate assets of Sunrise Senior Living in a transaction valued at $4.3 billion. Sunrise owned 125 properties in large urban areas in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, including 120 wholly owned properties and five joint-venture properties. In a related deal, Sunrise's property management business was recapitalized and spun-off to a partnership including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, affiliates of Beecken Petty O'Keefe & Company, and Coastwood Senior Housing Partners LLC for $130 million. HCN bought out their interests in late 2014 through a joint venture with Canadian senior living operator Revera, with Revera owning a 76% equity interest in the Sunrise Senior Living real estate management and the remainder owned by Welltower.[17]
Welltower first partnered with Revera in May 2013 when it formed a joint venture to share ownership of 47 Revera retirement residences in Canada. The company bought a 75% interest in the approximately CAD$1.35 billion portfolio with Revera owning the remaining 25%. In 2015, the joint venture then acquired Regal Lifestyle Communities for CAD$764 million (CAD$12 per share). Regal held 23 private-pay senior housing properties with 3,600 units. Thirteen of these properties are in Ontario and seven are in Quebec. One property each is located in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland. The initial cash-on-cash yield of these properties was estimated at 6.1%[18]
In early 2015, the company purchased all of Aspen Healthcare's four London hospitals for £226 million. The hospitals were then leased back to Aspen which continues to operate them. The deal included Holly House Hospital, Highgate Hospital, Parkside Hospital and Cancer Centre London. They were leased back to Aspen for 25-year terms.[19]
In August 2015, Welltower formed a joint venture with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) to acquire a combined interest of 50.5% in a portfolio of medical office buildings in Southern California. This portfolio was purchased from G&L Realty, another healthcare real estate investment trust. In February 2016, Welltower announced that it had formed another joint venture with the CPPIB to buy a 97.5% interest in senior housing run by Discovery Senior Living in Florida for $555 million. The remaining 2.5% equity was retained by Discovery which operates all six properties. These properties are known as "Aston Gardens." Aston Gardens includes 1,930 units and provides a combination of independent living, assisted living, and memory care.[20]
Welltower announced an agreement to buy 19 properties from Vintage Senior Living for $1.15 billion in August 2016 and closed in September of the same year. The properties sold include facilities for independent living, assisted living, and memory care mostly located in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. Before this transaction Welltower owned 114 healthcare properties in California. After closing it will become the largest owner of senior housing in the state. Welltower said it planned to transfer management of the properties to its partner property management firms. Eleven properties were to be assigned to Senior Resource Group, seven to Sunrise Senior Living, one to Silverado.[21]
As of 2016, Welltower plans to construct a high-end facility in Manhattan that provides assisted living and memory care services. The facility will be wired for telemedicine and the ground floor will have retail space. The second floor will be dedicated to a large community area with floor-to-ceiling windows. Upper floors will be devoted to residences and community areas including outdoor living spaces and terraced gardens. The company partnered with luxury real-estate developer Hines to buy a two-parcel site at 56th Street and Lexington Avenue where they plan to build a 15-story tower designed by SLCE Architects. The site and existing buildings cost about $115 million. Wells Fargo provided a major part of the financing for the deal. There are few senior living communities on Manhattan, which has fewer than 75 beds that are fully licensed by the New York State Department of Health to provide assisted living and memory care services. Welltower's move into Manhattan is part of its strategy to invest in markets with high barriers to entry.[7][22][23]
Foundation[edit]
In 2016, the company started the Welltower Foundation with the mission of "promoting wellness, encouraging a high quality of life for aging populations and supporting other groups and innovations that do the same." Erin Ibele is the foundation's first president. The foundation's first gift was a $250,000 grant to the Alzheimer's Association in support of the group's annual Brain Ball. The Brain Ball is a national event designed to improve awareness of Alzheimer's and its effects and raise money for research and patient services.[24]

Welltower's move into Manhattan is part of its strategy to invest in markets with high barriers to entry.[7][22][23]
Foundation[edit]
In 2016, the company started the Welltower Foundation with the mission of "promoting wellness, encouraging a high quality of life for aging populations and supporting other groups and innovations that do the same." Erin Ibele is the foundation's first president. The foundation's first gift was a $250,000 grant to the Alzheimer's Association in support of the group's annual Brain Ball. The Brain Ball is a national event designed to improve awareness of Alzheimer's and its effects and raise money for research and patient services.[24]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1970 by Bruce Thompson and Frederic D. Wolfe as the first healthcare focused real estate investment trust (REIT). The REIT structure is a tax status that allows commercial real estate income to pass through to shareholders without being taxed at the corporate level.[1] The company was led by George Chapman from 1996 to 2014, when he retired and was succeeded by Thomas DeRosa.[6] DeRosa served on the board for many years before becoming CEO; he has been associated with the company since 1992. DeRosa previously worked as vice chairman and chief financial officer of the Rouse Company before it merged with General Growth Properties.[7]
Originally named Health Care Fund, the company changed its name to Health Care REIT in 1985. Health Care REIT became Welltower in September 2015.[8] The company says its latest name change reflects shifts in its business model and distinguishes it from others in its category.[9]
The 2008 passage of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act (RIDEA) prompted a significant change in the company's business model. Prior to RIDEA, healthcare REITs were required to hold their assets under triple-net leases that limited their role primarily to collecting rent. RIDEA allowed healthcare REITs to participate in the actual net operating income of their properties subject to certain requirements such as using a third-party management firm. As of 2015, the company held 35% of its portfolio in RIDEA-structured investments and 27% in properties under triple-net leases.[10]
Welltower stock trades under the symbol "HCN" on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Welltower relies heavily on institutional funds to provide capital through public debt and equity markets.[7] As of early 2016, Welltower had a market capitalization of $24 billion. This is up from $150 million in 1992.[11]
Welltower is based in Toledo, Ohio where it maintains a 160-acre campus. As of 2015, it had almost 500 employees. About 200 of them work at its headquarters in Toledo. Welltower also has offices in Jupiter, Florida; Beverly Hills, California; London; and Toronto.[9] Welltower has about 1,400 properties in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Most of its properties in Canada and the United Kingdom are close to Toronto and London respectively.[7]
Acquisitions and developments[edit]
The company's acquisitions since 2011 were part of a broader market trend towards purchases of large property portfolios. During that year, publicly traded REITs and operators did 94 deals with a total transaction value of $24.5 billion.[12] In 2011, HCN acquired nearly all the real estate assets of Genesis HealthCare for $2.4 billion. The transaction included 147 properties including post-acute, skilled nursing, and assisted living facilities in 11 states. Genesis continues to operate the properties.[13]
HCN formed a partnership valued at $890 million with Benchmark Senior Living that was announced in February 2011 and closed in March of the same year. The partnership included 34 private-pay senior housing complexes. In January 2015, the company acquired nine Benchmark Senior Living complexes located in New England for $360 million.[14][15]
The company invested about $5 billion in 2012; it primarily targeted private-pay senior housing and medical office buildings. This included spending $530 million buying assets from Belmont Village Senior Living and $240 million on a property portfolio from Brookdale Senior Living.[16]
On January 8, 2013, the company acquired nearly all the real estate assets of Sunrise Senior Living in a transaction valued at $4.3 billion. Sunrise owned 125 properties in large urban areas in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, including 120 wholly owned properties and five joint-venture properties. In a related deal, Sunrise's property management business was recapitalized and spun-off to a partnership including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, affiliates of Beecken Petty O'Keefe & Company, and Coastwood Senior Housing Partners LLC for $130 million. HCN bought out their interests in late 2014 through a joint venture with Canadian senior living operator Revera, with Revera owning a 76% equity interest in the Sunrise Senior Living real estate management and the remainder owned by Welltower.[17]
Welltower first partnered with Revera in May 2013 when it formed a joint venture to share ownership of 47 Revera retirement residences in Canada. The company bought a 75% interest in the approximately CAD$1.35 billion portfolio with Revera owning the remaining 25%. In 2015, the joint venture then acquired Regal Lifestyle Communities for CAD$764 million (CAD$12 per share). Regal held 23 private-pay senior housing properties with 3,600 units. Thirteen of these properties are in Ontario and seven are in Quebec. One property each is located in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland. The initial cash-on-cash yield of these properties was estimated at 6.1%[18]
In early 2015, the company purchased all of Aspen Healthcare's four London hospitals for £226 million. The hospitals were then leased back to Aspen which continues to operate them. The deal included Holly House Hospital, Highgate Hospital, Parkside Hospital and Cancer Centre London. They were leased back to Aspen for 25-year terms.[19]
In August 2015, Welltower formed a joint venture with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) to acquire a combined interest of 50.5% in a portfolio of medical office buildings in Southern California. This portfolio was purchased from G&L Realty, another healthcare real estate investment trust. In February 2016, Welltower announced that it had formed another joint venture with the CPPIB to buy a 97.5% interest in senior housing run by Discovery Senior Living in Florida for $555 million. The remaining 2.5% equity was retained by Discovery which operates all six properties. These properties are known as "Aston Gardens." Aston Gardens includes 1,930 units and provides a combination of independent living, assisted living, and memory care.[20]
Welltower announced an agreement to buy 19 properties from Vintage Senior Living for $1.15 billion in August 2016 and closed in September of the same year. The properties sold include facilities for independent living, assisted living, and memory care mostly located in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. Before this transaction Welltower owned 114 healthcare properties in California. After closing it will become the largest owner of senior housing in the state. Welltower said it planned to transfer management of the properties to its partner property management firms. Eleven properties were to be assigned to Senior Resource Group, seven to Sunrise Senior Living, one to Silverado.[21]
As of 2016, Welltower plans to construct a high-end facility in Manhattan that provides assisted living and memory care services. The facility will be wired for telemedicine and the ground floor will have retail space. The second floor will be dedicated to a large community area with floor-to-ceiling windows. Upper floors will be devoted to residences and community areas including outdoor living spaces and terraced gardens. The company partnered with luxury real-estate developer Hines to buy a two-parcel site at 56th Street and Lexington Avenue where they plan to build a 15-story tower designed by SLCE Architects. The site and existing buildings cost about $115 million. Wells Fargo provided a major part of the financing for the deal. There are few senior living communities on Manhattan, which has fewer than 75 beds that are fully licensed by the New York State Department of Health to provide assisted living and memory care services. Welltower's move into Manhattan is part of its strategy to invest in markets with high barriers to entry.[7][22][23]

Erin Ibele is the foundation's first president. The foundation's first gift was a $250,000 grant to the Alzheimer's Association in support of the group's annual Brain Ball. The Brain Ball is a national event designed to improve awareness of Alzheimer's and its effects and raise money for research and patient services.[24]

Sunrise owned 125 properties in large urban areas in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, including 120 wholly owned properties and five joint-venture properties. In a related deal, Sunrise's property management business was recapitalized and spun-off to a partnership including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, affiliates of Beecken Petty O'Keefe & Company, and Coastwood Senior Housing Partners LLC for $130 million. HCN bought out their interests in late 2014 through a joint venture with Canadian senior living operator Revera, with Revera owning a 76% equity interest in the Sunrise Senior Living real estate management and the remainder owned by Welltower.[17]
Welltower first partnered with Revera in May 2013 when it formed a joint venture to share ownership of 47 Revera retirement residences in Canada. The company bought a 75% interest in the approximately CAD$1.35 billion portfolio with Revera owning the remaining 25%. In 2015, the joint venture then acquired Regal Lifestyle Communities for CAD$764 million (CAD$12 per share). Regal held 23 private-pay senior housing properties with 3,600 units. Thirteen of these properties are in Ontario and seven are in Quebec. One property each is located in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland. The initial cash-on-cash yield of these properties was estimated at 6.1%[18]
In early 2015, the company purchased all of Aspen Healthcare's four London hospitals for £226 million. The hospitals were then leased back to Aspen which continues to operate them. The deal included Holly House Hospital, Highgate Hospital, Parkside Hospital and Cancer Centre London. They were leased back to Aspen for 25-year terms.[19]
In August 2015, Welltower formed a joint venture with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) to acquire a combined interest of 50.5% in a portfolio of medical office buildings in Southern California. This portfolio was purchased from G&L Realty, another healthcare real estate investment trust. In February 2016, Welltower announced that it had formed another joint venture with the CPPIB to buy a 97.5% interest in senior housing run by Discovery Senior Living in Florida for $555 million. The remaining 2.5% equity was retained by Discovery which operates all six properties. These properties are known as "Aston Gardens." Aston Gardens includes 1,930 units and provides a combination of independent living, assisted living, and memory care.[20]
Welltower announced an agreement to buy 19 properties from Vintage Senior Living for $1.15 billion in August 2016 and closed in September of the same year. The properties sold include facilities for independent living, assisted living, and memory care mostly located in the Los Angeles and San Francisco areas. Before this transaction Welltower owned 114 healthcare properties in California. After closing it will become the largest owner of senior housing in the state. Welltower said it planned to transfer management of the properties to its partner property management firms. Eleven properties were to be assigned to Senior Resource Group, seven to Sunrise Senior Living, one to Silverado.[21]
As of 2016, Welltower plans to construct a high-end facility in Manhattan that provides assisted living and memory care services. The facility will be wired for telemedicine and the ground floor will have retail space. The second floor will be dedicated to a large community area with floor-to-ceiling windows. Upper floors will be devoted to residences and community areas including outdoor living spaces and terraced gardens. The company partnered with luxury real-estate developer Hines to buy a two-parcel site at 56th Street and Lexington Avenue where they plan to build a 15-story tower designed by SLCE Architects. The site and existing buildings cost about $115 million. Wells Fargo provided a major part of the financing for the deal. There are few senior living communities on Manhattan, which has fewer than 75 beds that are fully licensed by the New York State Department of Health to provide assisted living and memory care services. Welltower's move into Manhattan is part of its strategy to invest in markets with high barriers to entry.[7][22][23]
Foundation[edit]
In 2016, the company started the Welltower Foundation with the mission of "promoting wellness, encouraging a high quality of life for aging populations and supporting other groups and innovations that do the same." Erin Ibele is the foundation's first president. The foundation's first gift was a $250,000 grant to the Alzheimer's Association in support of the group's annual Brain Ball. The Brain Ball is a national event designed to improve awareness of Alzheimer's and its effects and raise money for research and patient services.[24]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1970 by Bruce Thompson and Frederic D. Wolfe as the first healthcare focused real estate investment trust (REIT). The REIT structure is a tax status that allows commercial real estate income to pass through to shareholders without being taxed at the corporate level.[1] The company was led by George Chapman from 1996 to 2014, when he retired and was succeeded by Thomas DeRosa.[6] DeRosa served on the board for many years before becoming CEO; he has been associated with the company since 1992. DeRosa previously worked as vice chairman and chief financial officer of the Rouse Company before it merged with General Growth Properties.[7]
Originally named Health Care Fund, the company changed its name to Health Care REIT in 1985. Health Care REIT became Welltower in September 2015.[8] The company says its latest name change reflects shifts in its business model and distinguishes it from others in its category.[9]
The 2008 passage of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act (RIDEA) prompted a significant change in the company's business model. Prior to RIDEA, healthcare REITs were required to hold their assets under triple-net leases that limited their role primarily to collecting rent. RIDEA allowed healthcare REITs to participate in the actual net operating income of their properties subject to certain requirements such as using a third-party management firm. As of 2015, the company held 35% of its portfolio in RIDEA-structured investments and 27% in properties under triple-net leases.[10]
Welltower stock trades under the symbol "HCN" on the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Welltower relies heavily on institutional funds to provide capital through public debt and equity markets.[7] As of early 2016, Welltower had a market capitalization of $24 billion. This is up from $150 million in 1992.[11]
Welltower is based in Toledo, Ohio where it maintains a 160-acre campus. As of 2015, it had almost 500 employees. About 200 of them work at its headquarters in Toledo. Welltower also has offices in Jupiter, Florida; Beverly Hills, California; London; and Toronto.[9] Welltower has about 1,400 properties in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Most of its properties in Canada and the United Kingdom are close to Toronto and London respectively.[7]
Acquisitions and developments[edit]
The company's acquisitions since 2011 were part of a broader market trend towards purchases of large property portfolios. During that year, publicly traded REITs and operators did 94 deals with a total transaction value of $24.5 billion.[12] In 2011, HCN acquired nearly all the real estate assets of Genesis HealthCare for $2.4 billion. The transaction included 147 properties including post-acute, skilled nursing, and assisted living facilities in 11 states. Genesis continues to operate the properties.[13]
HCN formed a partnership valued at $890 million with Benchmark Senior Living that was announced in February 2011 and closed in March of the same year. The partnership included 34 private-pay senior housing complexes. In January 2015, the company acquired nine Benchmark Senior Living complexes located in New England for $360 million.[14][15]
The company invested about $5 billion in 2012; it primarily targeted private-pay senior housing and medical office buildings. This included spending $530 million buying assets from Belmont Village Senior Living and $240 million on a property portfolio from Brookdale Senior Living.[16]
On January 8, 2013, the company acquired nearly all the real estate assets of Sunrise Senior Living in a transaction valued at $4.3 billion. Sunrise owned 125 properties in large urban areas in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, including 120 wholly owned properties and five joint-venture properties. In a related deal, Sunrise's property management business was recapitalized and spun-off to a partnership including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company, affiliates of Beecken Petty O'Keefe & Company, and Coastwood Senior Housing Partners LLC for $130 million. HCN bought out their interests in late 2014 through a joint venture with Canadian senior living operator Revera, with Revera owning a 76% equity interest in the Sunrise Senior Living real estate management and the remainder owned by Welltower.[17]

Welltower said it planned to transfer management of the properties to its partner property management firms. Eleven properties were to be assigned to Senior Resource Group, seven to Sunrise Senior Living, one to Silverado.[21]
As of 2016, Welltower plans to construct a high-end facility in Manhattan that provides assisted living and memory care services. The facility will be wired for telemedicine and the ground floor will have retail space. The second floor will be dedicated to a large community area with floor-to-ceiling windows. Upper floors will be devoted to residences and community areas including outdoor living spaces and terraced gardens.

3 Stocks With Better Dividends Than Welltower Inc.
Why AT&T, Enterprise Products Partners, and Medical Properties Trust are better dividend stock picks than Welltower.

Any way you look at it, Welltower Inc. (NYSE:HCN) is an outstanding dividend stock. The healthcare real estate investment trust (REIT) pays out a solid dividend that currently yields 4.49%. It has a great overall track record of increasing its dividend. And the stock itself has performed quite well also.
But as good as Welltower is, there are better dividend stocks. Here's why AT&T (NYSE:T), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), and Medical Properties Trust (NYSE:MPW) look like smarter picks right now.

AT&T
The stock chart of telecommunications giant AT&T appears to be almost a mirror image of Welltower so far this year. AT&T's share price has dropped almost as much as Welltower's share price has climbed. However, AT&T easily tops Welltower when it comes to dividends.
For one thing, AT&T holds the elite status of Dividend Aristocrat. The company has increased its dividend for 32 consecutive years. AT&T's yield of 5.16% is well above Welltower's. And although the telecommunications company is using 95% of its earnings to fund the dividend, that's still better than Welltower, which is spending more on its dividend than it has earned.
What about AT&T's recent history of spotty revenue and earnings growth? It's no secret that the company operates in an intensely competitive industry. However, AT&T's pending acquisition of Time Warner (NYSE:TWX) gives it something that the company has lacked in filling out its lineup of products and services: content. Assuming the deal goes through, AT&T should be in a nice position to launch its own wireless cable service in the future. 
Enterprise Products Partners
Enterprise Products Partners hasn't experienced as tough of a year in 2017 as AT&T has. However, the midstream energy company's year-to-date stock performance doesn't match up to Welltower's. I wouldn't worry too much about these short-term results, though.
Steady dividends from Enterprise have likely kept shareholders fairly happy. The yield currently stands at 6.31%. Enterprise has increased its dividend for 18 years in a row. The company is spending nearly 130% of earnings to pay out those dividends, but Enterprise's strong cash flow allows it to keep the dividends flowing anyway.
Over the long run, Enterprise Products Partners has a lot to offer investors beyond its dividend. Most of its business is fee-based, so the company isn't as vulnerable to fluctuations in oil and gas prices. Enterprise is also investing in the future, with $8.4 billion worth of major capital projects in the works.





Medical Properties Trust
Medical Properties Trust has several things in common with Welltower. Both are REITs. Both focus on healthcare (although Medical Properties Trust focuses primarily on hospitals while Welltower has more exposure to senior housing). Both also have really attractive dividends -- except Medical Properties Trust appears to have an advantage in that area.
Welltower does claim a better record of dividend increases, since Medical Properties Trust only has a three-year streak of consecutive annual dividend increases. However, Medical Properties Trust's dividend yield of 7.25% is simply outstanding. The company also has a payout ratio similar to that of Welltower.
There are a couple of other reasons investors might prefer Medical Properties Trust. First, it's significantly cheaper than Welltower, with shares trading at only 13 times expected earnings versus a forward earnings multiple of 40 for Welltower. Second, Medical Properties Trust appears poised for higher earnings growth over the next few years than Welltower is.

Welltower Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results
        																																																								
              
















 News provided by
Welltower Inc.  
Jul 28, 2017, 07:00 ET









 Share this article




























































TOLEDO, Ohio, July 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Welltower Inc. (NYSE:    HCN) today announced results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. For the quarter, we generated net income attributable to common stockholders of $0.51 per share and normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders of $1.06 per share.








Quarterly Highlights

Seniors housing operating SSNOI grew 3.5% and SS REVPOR grew 3.9% 
Increasing total SSNOI guidance to 2.25%-3% from 2%-3% due to stronger 1H17 seniors housing operating performance 
Net debt to undepreciated book capitalization declined to 35.0% from 39.2% at 6/30/16 
Net debt to adjusted EBITDA improved to 5.17x from 5.47x in 2Q16

"Our core diversified health care real estate platform continues to drive outperformance and demonstrates the value of owning best in class real estate managed by the industry's top operators," commented CEO Tom DeRosa. "Increasing demand for high-end seniors housing has led to pricing power and enabled Welltower to drive consistent rate growth. We are pleased to be raising guidance for our total same store portfolio as a result of our strong first half performance."
Capital Activity On June 30, 2017, we had $442 million of cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion of available borrowing capacity under our primary unsecured credit facility.  During the second quarter, we generated approximately $192 million in proceeds under our ATM program at an average price of $72.56. In addition, we extinguished $182 million of secured debt during the quarter, bringing our year to date retirement of debt and preferred securities to $1.275 billion at a blended average rate of 5.6%.
Outlook for 2017 Net income attributable to common stockholders has been revised to a range of $2.32 to $2.42 per diluted share from the previous range of $2.39 to $2.49 per diluted share primarily due to the normalizing items in Exhibit 1 and impairments. We are affirming our 2017 normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders guidance and expect to report in a range of $4.15 to $4.25 per diluted share.  As previously disclosed, we will no longer report FAD, primarily because it could be considered a liquidity metric, but we will provide relevant data components. In preparing our guidance, we have updated the following assumptions:

Same Store NOI: We are increasing SSNOI guidance and now expect average blended SSNOI growth of approximately 2.25%-3% in 2017, up from 2%-3% primarily due to better than expected performance in our seniors housing operating portfolio in the first half of 2017. 
Acquisitions: 2017 earnings guidance excludes any additional potential acquisitions beyond what has been announced. 
Development: We anticipate funding additional development of approximately $173 million in 2017 relating to projects underway on June 30, 2017. We expect development conversions during the remainder of 2017 of approximately $143 million, which are currently expected to generate stabilized yields of approximately 8.8%. These projections exclude the development projects in London and midtown Manhattan which are still in the planning stages. 
Dispositions: We continue to anticipate approximately $2 billion of disposition proceeds at a blended yield of 7.6% in 2017. This includes approximately $1.3 billion of proceeds from dispositions completed to-date and $0.7 billion of incremental proceeds from other potential loan payoffs and property sales.

Our guidance does not include any additional investments, dispositions or capital transactions beyond what we have announced, nor any transaction costs, impairments, unanticipated additions to the loan loss reserve or other additional normalizing items.  Please see the exhibits for a reconciliation of the outlook for net income available to common stockholders to normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders.  We will provide additional detail regarding our 2017 outlook and assumptions on the second quarter 2017 conference call.
Dividend Growth As previously announced, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 of $0.87 per share, as compared to $0.86 per share for the same period in 2016.  On August 21, 2017, we will pay our 185th consecutive quarterly cash dividend.  The declaration and payment of future quarterly dividends remains subject to review and approval by the Board of Directors.
Investment and Disposition Activity We completed $292 million of pro rata gross investments for the quarter including $110 million in acquisitions/JVs, $162 million in development funding and $20 million in loans. 92% of these investments were completed with existing relationships. Acquisitions/JVs were comprised of four separate transactions at a blended yield of 6.5%. The development fundings are expected to yield 7.8% upon stabilization and the loans were made at a blended rate of 6.6%. We also placed into service 10 development projects totaling $273 million at a blended stabilized yield of 7.6%. Also during the quarter, we completed total dispositions of $160 million consisting of loan payoffs of $43 million at an average yield of 8.9% and property sales of $117 million at a blended yield on proceeds of 9.3%.
Notable Investments with Existing Operating Partners
Legend Senior Living We expanded our relationship with Legend by acquiring two purpose-built, private pay seniors housing properties located in Tulsa, OK and Greeley, CO. The properties were acquired through our existing 88/12 joint venture with Legend and the purchase price based on a 100% ownership interest was $49 million. These properties were added to an existing long-term master lease at an initial lease yield of 6.25% and which escalates 3.25% annually. Since starting our initial $6 million development in 2005, we have completed $547 million of follow-on investments with Legend.
Sagora Senior Living We expanded our relationship with Sagora by acquiring a 100% ownership interest in a 90-unit private pay seniors housing property owned by a third party and located in the Houston MSA for $24 million. The property opened in 2015 and was added to a master lease which has a corporate guarantee and expires in 2032. The initial lease yield is 6.25% with 5% annual increasers for the first two years and then 3.5% annual increasers thereafter. Since closing our initial $8.5 million acquisition in 2010, we have completed $460 million of follow-on investments with Sagora.
Ascension Health We acquired an on-campus, affiliated outpatient medical office building in the Austin MSA. The purchase price was $19 million, representing a 6.7% stabilized cap rate. The property is 80,734 rentable square feet, was built in 2014, and is 75.8% leased. It is located on the campus of a 93-bed Ascension Health affiliated hospital. Ascension Health, the largest non-profit health system in the U.S. and the world's largest Catholic health system, encompasses 15,721 staffed beds across 128 hospitals and generates $17.7 billion of annual net patient revenues.
Notable Investments with New Operating Partners
University of California Irvine Health We acquired an off-campus, affiliated outpatient medical office building in Costa Mesa, CA in a 55/45 joint venture with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The purchase price based upon 100% ownership interest was $43 million, which represents a year one cap rate of 6.9%. After factoring in the above market rate debt, the effective cap rate is 6.2%. The property is 76,880 rentable square feet, was built in 2007, and is 93% leased. UC Irvine Health leases 39% of the building's RSF and is a new tenant for Welltower. UC Irvine Health is owned and operated by The Regents of the University of California (Moody's A2), a public university system with 10 campuses.
Notable Development Conversions
Sunrise Senior Living We expanded our relationships with Sunrise and Revera by completing the development of two private pay, seniors housing properties located in Bath and High Wycombe, U.K. for £24 million based upon 100% ownership. Revera is a 25% joint venture partner. The purchase price represents an 8.1% stabilized return on cost. Since closing our initial $243 million acquisition in 2012, we have completed $5.1 billion of follow-on pro rata investments with Sunrise.
Brandywine Living We expanded our relationship with Brandywine by completing the development of a 120-unit senior housing property located in the New York MSA.  The investment amount based upon 100% ownership interest was $53 million and the property was added to a newly-created master lease in a 95/5 joint venture at an initial lease yield of 7.0%.  There are outsized annual escalators for the first five years of the lease followed by 25 basis point annual escalators thereafter.  Since closing our initial $599 million acquisition/leaseback in 2010, we have completed $397 million of follow-on pro rata investments with Brandywine. 
Kisco We expanded our relationship with Kisco by completing the development of 60 assisted living, memory care and private pay long-term/post-acute units as part of a private pay, rental continuing care retirement community campus located in the North Hills area of Raleigh, NC.  The 165 IL units were completed in 1Q17.  The investment amount based on 100% ownership interest was $23 million and the property was added to a master lease at an initial lease yield of 8.0% in our existing 85/15 joint venture. There are no increasers for the first five years and 25 basis point annual increasers thereafter.  Since closing our initial $19 million acquisition in 2012, we have completed $137 million of follow-on investments with Kisco.
Medstar We completed a 46,326 square foot development of an outpatient medical building in Timonium, MD that is 100% leased by Medstar Health. The investment amount was $21 million and the yield on the development is 6.0%.
St. John Providence We completed a 56,211 square foot development of an outpatient medical building in Howell, MI that is 70% leased by St. John Providence, a subsidiary of Ascension Health, with the remaining space fully occupied by several physician practices. The investment amount was $16 million and the stabilized yield on the development is 8.1%. 
Notable Dispositions
Foundations Health Solutions We completed the disposition of 11 triple-net facilities for $117 million. The properties were purchased by Foundations and continue to be operated and managed by Foundations. We realized a gain on sale of $42 million and an unlevered IRR of 11.4%. 
Genesis Healthcare We received $28 million in loan repayments from Genesis at an average yield of 10%. 
Conference Call Information We have scheduled a conference call on Friday, July 28, 2017 at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss our second quarter 2017 results, industry trends, portfolio performance and outlook for 2017. Telephone access will be available by dialing 888-346-2469 or 706-758-4923 (international).  For those unable to listen to the call live, a taped rebroadcast will be available beginning two hours after completion of the call through August 11, 2017. To access the rebroadcast, dial 855-859-2056 or 404-537-3406 (international).  The conference ID number is 44271382. To participate in the webcast, log on to www.welltower.com 15 minutes before the call to download the necessary software.  Replays will be available for 90 days.
Supplemental Reporting Measures We believe that revenues, net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (NICS), as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider funds from operations (FFO), net operating income (NOI), same store net operating income (SSNOI), same store revenues per occupied room (SS REVPOR), and Adjusted EBITDA (A-EBITDA) to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Excluding A-EBITDA, these supplemental measures are disclosed on our pro rata ownership basis. Pro rata amounts are derived by reducing consolidated amounts for minority partners' noncontrolling ownership interests and adding our minority ownership share of unconsolidated amounts. We do not control unconsolidated investments. While we consider pro rata disclosures useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution.
Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) created FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO attributable to common stockholders, as defined by NAREIT, means net income attributable to common stockholders, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairments of depreciable assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.   Normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders represents FFO attributable to common stockholders adjusted for certain items detailed in Exhibit 1.  We believe that normalized FFO attributable to common stockholders is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance because investors and equity analysts may use this measure to compare the operating performance of the company between periods or as compared to other REITs or other companies on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by unanticipated and/or incalculable items.
We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses.  Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our seniors housing operating and outpatient medical properties.  These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance.  General and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations or transaction costs.  These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets.
SSNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio.  As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods.  Land parcels, loans and sub-leases as well as any properties acquired, developed/redeveloped, transitioned, sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts.  Normalizers include adjustments that in management's opinion are appropriate in considering SSNOI, a supplemental, non-GAAP performance measure.  None of these adjustments, which may increase or decrease SSNOI, are reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Significant normalizers (defined as any that individually exceed 0.50% of SSNOI growth per property type) are separately disclosed and explained in the relevant supplemental information package. We believe SSNOI provides investors relevant and useful information because it measures the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. No reconciliation of the forecasted range for SSNOI on a combined or segment basis for fiscal year 2017 is included in this release because we are unable to quantify certain amounts that would be required to be included in the comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts, and we believe such reconciliation would imply a degree of precision that could be confusing or misleading to investors.
REVPOR represents the average revenues generated per occupied room per month at our seniors housing operating properties.  It is calculated as the pro rata version of resident fees and services revenues per the income statement divided by average monthly occupied room days.  SS REVPOR is used to evaluate the REVPOR performance of our properties under a consistent population which eliminates changes in the composition of our portfolio. It is based on the same pool of properties used for SSNOI and includes any revenue normalizations used for SSNOI. We use REVPOR and SS REVPOR to evaluate the revenue-generating capacity and profit potential of our seniors housing operating portfolio independent of fluctuating occupancy rates. They are also used in comparison against industry and competitor statistics, if known, to evaluate the quality of our seniors housing operating portfolio.
We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and IRC section 1031 deposits. We expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. The coverage ratios are based on EBITDA which stands for earnings (net income per income statement) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Covenants in our senior unsecured notes contain financial ratios based on a definition of EBITDA that is specific to those agreements.  Failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.  Due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we have defined A-EBITDA to exclude unconsolidated entities and to include adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, transactions costs, gains/losses/impairments on properties, gains/losses on derivatives and other non-recurring and/or non-cash income/charges. We believe that A-EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. Our leverage ratios include net debt to undepreciated book capitalization and net debt to A-EBITDA. Undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. Book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents and any IRC section 1031 deposits), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests.
Our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and ratings agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies.  Our management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to historical operating results and in making operating decisions.  Additionally, they are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management.  The supplemental reporting measures do not represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity.  Finally, the supplemental reporting measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.  Please see the exhibits for reconciliations of supplemental reporting measures and the supplemental information package for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which is available on the company's website (www.welltower.com), for information and reconciliations of additional supplemental reporting measures.
