Fund share values are sensitive to stock market volatility. Investments in foreign instruments or currencies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. In emerging countries, these risks may be more significant. No Fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a Fund. The Fund may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Investing entails risk, and each investment strategy listed is subject to specific risks, highlighted below. 

Equity: Equity investment values are sensitive to stock market volatility.

Volatility: While certain funds have a targeted annual performance volatility range, their actual, or realized, volatility for longer or shorter periods may be materially higher or lower than the target range, depending on market conditions.

Taxes: Market conditions may limit the ability to generate tax losses or to generate dividend income taxed at favorable tax rates. The ability to utilize various tax-managed techniques may be curtailed or eliminated in the future by tax legislation or regulation.

Option strategy risk: The effectiveness of an option strategy is dependent upon a general imbalance of natural buyers over natural sellers of index options. This imbalance could decrease or be eliminated, which could have an adverse effect on a client portfolio.

Option overlay: An investor that sells an index call option incurs a liability in exchange for the up-front receipt of the option premium received. There is no guarantee that the investor’s portfolio will accurately track the index performance. This liability may result in the needed sale of assets. Participation in the program includes the purchase of put options or put spreads. There is no guarantee that the index put options included in the program will effectively protect the investor’s actual portfolio holdings. The actual performance of the investor’s portfolio may underperform the index and result in significant losses for the investor. The purchase and sale of options and the sale of investor assets may produce tax consequences for U.S. taxpayers. In the event of required asset sales, substantial capital gains taxes could be incurred. Discuss with your personal tax advisor how selling call options, purchasing put options or put spreads, and any potential sales of investor assets may affect your tax situation.

Advisory Services described here are offered through Eaton Vance Management and Parametric Portfolio Associates LLC. Investors should contact their financial advisor, as not all investments are suitable for all investors.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
