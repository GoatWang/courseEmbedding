  Actionable Conclusions (1-10): Broker Analysts Augured 20.6% To 36.6% Net Gains For Ten Russell 1000Â® Dogs By July 2018  Two of ten top Russell 1000 dividend dogs by yield were verified as being among the top ten of thirty gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1-year target prices. (Their names are tinted gray in the chart above). So, this yield-based forecast was graded by Wall St. wizards as 20% accurate. Ten probable profit-generating trades were revealed in YCharts for July 2018: CoreCivic (CXW) was projected to net $366.62, based on a median target estimates from seven analysts, plus dividends, less broker fees. The Beta number showed this estimate subject to volatility 13% less than the market as a whole.

 The Dividend Dogs Rule Stocks earned the "dog" moniker by exhibiting three traits: (1) paying reliable, repeating dividends, (2) their prices fell to where (3) yield (dividend/price) grew higher than their peers. Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as "dogs." More precisely, these are, in fact, best called, "underdogs". 50 Top Russell 1000 Dividend Dogs By Yield 

  Actionable Conclusions (11-20) 10 Top Russell 1000Â® Dividend Stocks By Yield   Top ten Russell 1000Â® stocks selected 7/18/17 by yield represented two of eleven Morningstar sectors. Top yielding stock, New Residential Investment (NRZ) [1] was the one of nine real estate representatives in the top ten. The other eight placed second, through fifth, and seventh through tenth: Chimera Investment (CIM) [2], Two Harbors Investment (TWO) [3], Annaly Capital Management (NLY) [4], AGNC Investment (AGNC) [5], Uniti Group (UNIT) [7], MFA Financial (MFA) [8], Spirit Realty Capital (SRC) [9], Starwood Property Trust (STWD) [10]. Lastly, one communication services sector firm placed sixth, CenturyLink (CTL) [6] to complete the Russell 1000 top ten for July. Actionable Conclusions: (21-30) Top Ten Russell 1000 Dogs Showed 15.4% To 32.75% Upsides To July, 2018; (31) Lowest Downside From One of Six Was -6.54%.  


 To quantify top dog rankings, analyst mean price target estimates provide a "market sentiment" gauge of upside potential. Added to the simple high-yield "dog" metrics, analyst mean price target estimates provided another tool to dig out bargains.  Actionable Conclusions: Wall St. Brokers Calculated (32) A 10% Median Target Price Upside and (33) 14.4% Net Gain From 30 Russell 1000 Upside Dogs Come July 2018  The top thirty stocks were graphed below to show relative strengths by dividend and price as of July 18, 2017, and those projected by analyst mean price target estimates to the same date in 2018. 

 A hypothetical $1,000 investment in each equity was divided by the current share price to find the number of shares purchased. The shares number was then multiplied by projected annual per share dividend amounts to find the dividend return. Thereafter, the analyst mean target price gauged the stock price upsides and net gains including dividends, less broker fees, as of 2018. Historic prices and actual dividends paid from $10,000 invested as $1k in each of the stocks and the aggregate single share prices of those ten stocks created data points for 2017. Projections based on estimated dividend amounts from $1,000 invested in the ten stocks and aggregate 1-year analyst target share prices from Yahoo Finance created the 2018 data points green for price and blue for dividend. YChart analysts' median 1-year targets projected a 7.85% lower dividend from $10k invested as $1k in ten dogs in this group while aggregate single share price for those ten was projected to increase by 9.8% in the coming year. Notice, price moves about $400 away from dividend next year, coming nowhere near a transition to a Dow-like overbought condition for Russell 1000 top yield dogs in 2018.
 The number of analysts contributing to the target price estimate for each stock was noted in the next to the last column on the charts. Three to nine analysts was optimal for a valid projection estimate. Estimates provided by one analyst were generally not applied (n/a). A beta (risk) ranking for each stock was provided in the far right column of the above chart. A beta of 1 meant the stock's price would move with the market. Less than 1 showed lower than market movement. Higher than 1 showed greater than market movement. A negative beta number indicated the degree of a stock's movement opposite of market direction. Analysts Forecast A 21% Advantage For 5 Highest Yield, Lowest Priced Russell 1000 Dividend Stocks To July 2018 Ten top Russell 1000 dividend dogs were culled by yield for their monthly update. Yield (dividend / price) results verified by YCharts did the ranking. The master list was prescreened to only include firms with over 4% dividends and with net returns greater than -20%. 

 As noted above, top ten Russell 1000 dividend dogs selected 7/18/17 showing the highest dividend yields represented two of eleven in the Morningstar sector scheme.  Actionable Conclusions: Analysts Projected (34) 5 Lowest-Priced of the Top Ten Highest-Yield Russell 1000Â® Dogs Delivering 17.37% Vs. (35) 14.31% Net Gains by All Ten by July, 2018    

 $5000 invested as $1k in each of the five lowest-priced stocks in the top ten Dividend Russell 1000 kennel by yield were predicted by analysts to generate 21.43% more gain than $5,000 invested as $.5k in all ten. The very lowest priced Russell 1000 top yield dog, Spirit Realty Capital (SRC), was projected to deliver the best net gain of 24.38%.
 

 The five lowest-priced top yield Russell 1000 dividend dogs for July 17 were: Spirit Realty Capital (SRC); MFA Financial (MFA); Two Harbors Investment (TWO); Annaly Capital Management (NLY); New Residential Investment (NRZ), with prices ranging from $7.67 to $15.65. Five higher-priced Russell 1000 dividend dogs for June 6 were: Chimera Investment (CIM); AGNC Investment (AGNC); Starwood Property Trust (STWD); CenturyLink (CTL); United Group (UNIT), whose prices ranged from $18.36 to $25.19. The distinction between five low-priced dividend dogs and the general field of ten reflected Michael B. O'Higgins' "basic method" for beating the Dow. The scale of projected gains based on analyst targets added a unique element of "market sentiment" gauging upside potential. It provided a here-and-now equivalent of waiting a year to find out what might happen in the market. Caution is advised, since analysts are historically only 20% to 80% accurate on the direction of change and just 0% to 20% accurate on the degree of change.

A 10% Yield On A Battered REIT With Significant Upside - Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»A 10% Yield On A Battered REIT With Significant UpsideJul.11.17 | About: Spirit Realty (SRC) Trapping Value Deep Value, special situations, REITs, dividend investingSummaryThe retail sector malaise has spilled into the triple net lease REITs.An unusually bad quarter has sent Spirit Realty Corp. down almost 50% from its recent high.We note several positives about the REIT that allowed us to initiate a small position.Spirit Realty Capital's (NYSE:SRC) Q1-2017 was really spooky and there might be more pain ahead. But current extreme valuations and the fortress balance sheet compel us to take a position ahead of Q2-2017 results.  The last year has been a painful one for those who chose to invest in the retail space. Whether it was the retailers themselves, the retail mall REIT group, the triple net REITs, you were in for a rough ride. 

Within the latter two groups, Spirit Realty Capital (SRC) was one of the worst performers, outdone only by Pennsylvania REIT (PEI). We hold a constructive outlook on PEI and so we decided to see if SRC was worth an investment as well. The Business: SRC is a triple net lease REIT focusing on the retail sector. While majority of the its revenue is derived from retail, the small components of office and industrial help provide some level of diversification. Additionally, a large subset of retail is service-oriented versus "traditional retail" and hence less vulnerable to e-commerce. The Recent Issues:  The stock had been trending down in sympathy with the retailer woes but the Q1-2017 results is what created the big selloff. SRC decreased its guidance by about 10% for 2017, decided to stop acquiring new properties and brought to light several troubled retailers on their watch list that had defaulted. The analyst call was not a pleasant one for management with 3 different analysts (Daniel Donlan, Anthony Paolone & Rob Stevenson) either directly asking or suggesting that the company should basically sell and go private.
 

The additional issue that came to light was that management had factored in a rapid turnaround on some troubled properties to get to the new guidance of $0.80-$0.84 in AFFO. Failing that, the AFFO could come in significantly lower. The Portfolio: Looking at the statistics revealed by SRC on their portfolio, I got a feeling that some of the panic was the overly cautious tone of management. 

 Source: SRC presentation With a median 2.5X rent coverage, there is quite a lot of cushion for the underlying tenants to navigate difficult times. For comparison, Omega Health Investors Inc. (OHI) has a 1.35X rent coverage. While they are completely different industries, they have strong similarities (long triple net leases and recent oversupply and other industry woes). A legion of investors consider OHI to be an absolutely fantastic investment even with such poor rent coverage by their underlying tenants while SRC has been relegated to the dog house. Of course, from an investment standpoint, it is not their median properties that are the issue. It is their lower end ones that create the problems. Still, their overall distribution across different industries and their weighted average lease term of over 10 years is comforting. The bulk of their tenants have master lease clauses with cross default provisions. Shopko, their biggest tenant also has a rent coverage of 2.5X as mentioned on the conference call. Additionally, over 37% of their tenants are credit-rated or implied credit-rated.
 

Again, to equate to a retail triple net lease REIT, Realty Income (O) derives approximately 45% of its income from investment grade equivalent tenants. Valuation: SRC trades at about 9X 2017 AFFO and has a 9.8% dividend yield. The dividend payout is slightly below 90% assuming the mid-point of 2017 guidance is met. The implied cap rate on their portfolio is around 8.6%. 

 Source: Author's estimates and calculations Realty Income with what we consider a slightly better portfolio, trades at a 5.3% cap rate. While Realty Income is definitely in a better position than SRC, we do not see the distinction equivalent to 3.5% cap rate or twice the AFFO multiple. Lease Maturities And Debt: The lease maturities are quite modest and allow SRC to navigate this environment well. 

 Source: SRC 2016 Annual report The debt maturities are also well staggered and there is nothing on the horizon that concerns us for a triple net at 6.3X Debt to EBITDA. 


 Both Debt to EBITDA and unencumbered assets to total assets ratio have been moving in the right direction since the IPO. 

 Conclusion: The pressure is definitely on SRC's management to perform. If they thought Q1-2017 conference call was difficult then they are in for a storm in Q2-2017 if they do not deliver. I think there is still a good chance of a further cut in guidance as management numbers are a tad optimistic. We still like the valuation here and we are happy initiating a position after such a heavy selloff rather than getting sucked in at the highs. We have taken a small position ahead of Q2 (at $7.10) with the intention of adding should the stock have another significant selloff. On our now famous scale of 1-10 where 1 would be "Avoid like the bubonic plague" and 10 would be "Buy like this is Apple in March 2009," I would rate this a 6.5. We have a target price of $10.84, which is at an implied 7.0% cap rate. While that is a 45% upside with an additional 10% annual yield, the risk on this tempers our enthusiasm.

'Westworld' season 2 trailer stirs up nothing but troubleMeredith Chandler





The player piano is a metaphor for the whole show, mixing old and new, authentic and simulated, and using newer music in old-timey fashion is part of that. Television. The series is executive produced, written and directed by Jonathan Nolan, executive produced and written by Lisa Joy, and executive produced by J.J. He likes the notion that the hosts will never quite understand the way weaknesses of an ego-broken human make you want to cover things up and claw your way out of that. I was going to become strong. Then, we see Maeve (Thandie Newton) standing side by side with Lee Sizemore (Simon Quarterman) staring at a hallway filled with dead people (or hosts)."I'm a control freak, and I feel like that is the way forward to have power in a situation, particularly in a professional environment".Wood remarked that actresses so often have their wings clipped, metaphorically, in one-note roles, but Dolores was so transformative it was like getting condor wings. Be sure to stay tuned as more information about the series comes through. And he's exhausted of dying a lot, because the fake blood stays in your ears for days. "Until you've ridden a horse balls to the wind, as it were, you will not know true terror or true joy".

California Starbucks Customer Saves The Day During Robbery

Describing the sudden sense responsibility, and even panic, that came over her during the fourth episode when she realized how large Dolores' journey really was, Wood said, "We're all kind of building a tone together and kind of inventing a style that was really unique". It's tough! You're always looking over your shoulder.We also only got one phrase out of showrunner Jonathan Nolan when he was asked during the panel about the possibility of seeing Samurai World in season two: "It doesn't look like anything to me". But viewers should have already known that this was implicitly a construct since we'd just seen Dolores in the earlier scene, naked and alone inside of Dr. Robert Ford's workshop.

Fears grow for Ashes as pay row drags on - Newspaper
Sandy Mccarthy
July 23, 2017



Share












The previous Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) expired at the end of the financial year, with CA and ACA deadlocked over the issue of revenue sharing.
"Given past experience and the massive detail involved, this would take some time and still may not be completed with time enough to meet the needs of fans, sponsors and broadcasters invested in the upcoming tours and the summer of cricket", he said.The long-running impasse between players and Cricket Australia (CA) has so far failed to break, with 230 cricketers out of contract, while doubt has been cast on upcoming tours of Bangladesh and India, as well as this summer's Ashes series.A compromise deal looked to be progressing in talks this week between James Sutherland, the CA chief executive, and Alistair Nicholson, chief executive of the ACA, but negotiations ended yesterday when, it is understood, CA rejected a compromise proposal put forward by the ACA."Cricket Australia will not comment on details of the negotiation but productive discussions were held today and progress is being made on a range of issues", a CA spokesman said on Sunday night.It is pointed out that given Australia's looming test tour of Bangladesh, selected players are due to convene in Darwin for a pre-tour camp on 10 August before the squad's scheduled departure later in the month."We have been in constant communication with the ACA and we are expecting further meetings on the negotiation to continue over the coming days".The ACA has a six-point plan as part of what it has called a "terms sheet" - what it wants as common agreements with CA.

Quarterly Financial Watch for Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (NYSE:SRC)
					News headlines about Spirit Realty Capital (NYSE:SRC) have been trending positive this week, Accern Sentiment Analysis reports. Following the purchase, the executive vice president now directly owns 73,656 shares in the company, valued at $529,586.64.
				The ACA said it recently received draft legal wording removing all references to revenue sharing in a proposed section of the new MOU.Cricket Australia believes the revenue-share model is unfit for modern times and is starving grassroots cricket of funding, while players say it has underpinned the game's growth and prosperity over the past 20 years.That the ACA are now concerned that a number of fundamentals in this Terms Sheet had been dismissed by CA and are now seeking clarification."The previous MOU took nearly 18 months to draft following an in-principle position being reached by both parties", he said.When asked about the adverse impact this move could have on the future of Australian cricketers, Tim said that it's just a matter of when and Australian cricketers will play worldwide cricket soon again. I really think they will.She said players were not interested in an interim measure floated by former captain Michael Clarke of allowing the current pay deal to roll over for 12 months, giving both parties more time to strike a deal.The ongoing spat between the players and the game's governing body has left over 200 of Australia's top cricketers unemployed since July 1.The ACA had been willing to make some concessions including accepting CA forecasted revenue which fell AUS$100m short of their own estimates.

However, Heard is best known for starring in The Sopranos and playing Macaulay Culkin's father Peter McCallister in 1990's Home Alone and again in the sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in NY, two years later. The Santa Clara Medical Examiner's office also confirmed his death.The cause of death is still unclear, but the police are investigating and do not suspect foul play.Heard's passing occurred just two days after he underwent "minor back surgery" at Stanford Medical Center on Wednesday.Born in Washington, DC on March 7, 1945, Heard worked in theatre during the early part of his career. He won the off-Broadway Obie Award for his performance in Othello. He got his first break in Tom Hank's "Big".

Ocean Master's Army Featured In Aquaman Footage at SDCC

The actor rose to fame playing Peter McCallister, father of Culkin's character the mischievous Kevin, in the hit family comedy Home Alone (1990) and sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in NY (1992).His most memorable role came in 1990, when he portrayed Peter McCallister, the father of a family that left its son behind when they went off for a vacation, in the Christmas classic "Home Alone". "He's a gynecologist. And he's got, what, 12 kids or something?" he said. I think we even said something to each other about it."He was a kind guy and we have known each other for many years". "The character was real, it was a true story", he said."Bad guy" and "official" roles seemed to suit him, and he spun both into an Emmy-nominated guest arc on "The Sopranos". He also had a son Max, and a daughter Annika from a later marriage.

Welcome to Spirit Realty Capital

Spirit Realty Capital is one of the largest publicly traded triple net-lease real estate investment trusts (REITs) in the United States. We invest in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate: free-standing facilities where tenants conduct activities that are necessary for their sales and profits. Our tenants include well-known retail brands â many with 10-year leases â as well as healthcare, industrial, and other industries that need special-use facilities.
Client-focused results
Our investment strategy relies on disciplined acquisition, proactive portfolio management, and a strong balance sheet. Our management team has proven experience in creating value for our company and stockholders, while maintaining a client-centered approach to flexible lease structuring. Careful evaluation of industry data and economic cycles gives us a metric-based perspective in anticipating future trends. As a result, Spirit has thrived even in slow economic conditions. At the close of 2015, our gross real estate portfolio was approximately $8.3 billion, with over 2,600 properties leased to 438 clients in 49 states. And our occupancy rate was 98.6 percent.
Real Estate professionals with integrity
At the heart of our company is a team of smart, energetic people. We maintain a collaborative environment that nurtures talent and promotes integrity. Our employees expect the best of themselves and each other, and approach every challenge with a passion to succeed.

Why Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. Stock Plunged 23%
The REIT lowered guidance as weakness in the retail industry weighed on its first-quarter earnings report.











                Jordan Wathen
            

                (TMFValueMagnet)



            
            May 4, 2017 at 1:01PM
            
            





What's happening?
Shares of retail REIT Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (NYSE:SRC) are trading down by about 23% as of 11:30 a.m. EDT after the company reported that it experienced an "abnormally high credit loss" due to weakness in the retail sector in its first-quarter earnings report.
So what
Spirit Realty updated its adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) guidance for the full year 2017. It now expects to generate AFFO of $0.80 to $0.84 per share, down from earlier guidance of $0.89 to $0.91 per share.
The company also withdrew its $250 million net acquisition target for the full year, believing that it would be imprudent to increase the company's leverage in light of elevated bankruptcies in the retail industry. In a presentation, the company disclosed it is well within covenants on its senior unsecured borrowings.Â 
Spirit Realty's largest tenant, Shopko, is shuttering stores. Shopko made up 8.1% of its normalized revenue at the end of the first quarter, down from 9.1% in the same period a year ago. The company disclosed that it sold five more Shopko stores after the end of the first quarter. Shopko stores make up 14.2% of its real estate by square footage.

Shoppers aren't visiting retail stores as much as they used to, weighing on the share prices of retail REITs like Spirit Realty. Image source: Getty Images.

The income statement tells the story here. Impairment charges tallied to $34.4 million, up from $12.6 million during the year-ago period. Of the first-quarter impairments, $18.5 million were due to weakness in Spirit Realty's retail property portfolio, according to its 10-Q.Â 
Investors who use AFFO guidance as a guide for the future should mind the rules of accounting. Impairments are added back to net income to arrive at AFFO, and thus the REIT's updated AFFO guidance doesn't offer any insight into future impairment losses stemming from retail store closures.Â The company reported AFFO of $0.20 per share in the first quarter.





Now what
Spirit Realty finds itself as the face of widespread deterioration in the retail industry. A recent report by Cohen & Steers found that the United States has 24 feet of retail space per capita, 50% more than Canada, and more than two times that of Australia. National retailers have announced they will close 3,200 stores across the United States this year.
Seemingly every sell-side analyst piled on to downgrade Spirit Realty following its first-quarter results. Mizuho, JPMorgan Chase, Sandler O'Neill, UBS, and Ladenburg Thalmann are among those who downgraded the stock after its first-quarter earnings report.Â 
Spirit Realty primarily invests in single-tenant properties that it leases on terms spanning a decade or longer. With 75% of its portfolio by square footage categorized as retail property, continued weakness in retail could be a recurring drag on its earnings for some time to come.

DALLAS, May 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --Â Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (NYSE:    SRC) ("Spirit" or the "Company"), a premier net lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that primarily invests in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate, today announced that Jackson Hsieh has been named to the position of Chief Executive Officer and President and has been appointed to the Company's Board of Directors. In addition, the Company announced that Richard I. Gilchrist, formerly Lead Independent Director of the Company and veteran of the REIT industry, has been appointed as Chairman of the Board. As a consequence of these changes, Thomas H. Nolan is leaving the Company effective immediately. 








"We have made significant progress at Spirit, improving the quality of our talent, strengthening our operations and enhancing our capital structure, but we recognize there is still significant work to be done," stated Mr. Hsieh. "Our plan moving forward will focus critically on credit and tenant concentration challenges in order to enhance the profitability of our platform. We remain committed to growing the Company in a manner that enables us to strengthen our balance sheet, preserve liquidity and create long-term stockholder value." 
Mr. Hsieh joined Spirit Realty Capital in September 2016 from Morgan Stanley,Â where he served as Managing Director and Vice Chairman of Investment Banking, primarily focused on the firm's real estate clients. Prior to this, Mr. Hsieh was Vice Chairman and Sole/Co-Global Head of Real Estate Investment Banking Group at UBS, managing a team of over 70 professionals in six offices worldwide. During his career, including a prior period at Morgan Stanley and tenures at Bankers Trust Company and Salomon Brothers, Inc., he served as senior lead banker on over $285 billion of real estate and lodging transactions. Mr. Hsieh is a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley (1983), and earned a master's degree from Harvard University (1987). 
Mr. Gilchrist stated, "Elevating Jackson at this critical time reflects the Board's continued focus on improving Spirit's operating capabilities. In Jackson, we have a uniquely qualified leader who has a clear vision for how we grow our Company and create the best long-term outcome for Spirit's stockholders."
In an additional move by the Board, the Company also announced that it is creating an Operating Committee to be comprised of independent directors Nicholas P. Shepherd (as chair) and Kevin M. Charlton to work closely with Mr. Hsieh and members of his senior team. The committee has the authority to retain advisors.Â  
Commenting on theÂ Operating Committee, Mr. Gilchrist said, "By adding this new committee, the Board can provide practical support and assistance to Jackson as he transitions into his new role and starts the work of executing the Company's growth plan, while also strengthening Board oversight and interaction with management." 
The Board of Directors has also determined to reschedule the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders, originally scheduled for May 11, 2017, until a later date, currently expected to be by the end of June 2017. The Company will reschedule the meeting to circulate revised proxy materials reflecting the management changes described in this press release. In due course, the Company will submit a revised proxy statement to the stockholders, including a notice setting forth the date, time and location of the rescheduled Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The record date for holders entitled to vote at the meeting of the close of business on March 17, 2017 will remain unchanged. 
ABOUT SPIRIT REALTY CAPITAL: 
Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. (NYSE:    SRC) is a premier net-lease real estate investment trust (REIT) that primarily invests in high-quality, operationally essential real estate, subject to long-term, net leases.

The âdeath of retailâ has been a recurring theme of 2017, as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and other online retailers continue to erode the traditional brick-and-mortar business model.Â But one retail REIT in particular stands out for having been beaten like the proverbial red-headed stepchild: Spirit Realty Capital, IncÂ (NYSE:SRC).Spirit Realty Capital, Inc (New)MoreSource: ShutterstockYear-to-date, the battered REIT is down nearly 30%, and declines in SRC stock have pushed the yield aboveÂ 9%.After a drop like that, itâs fair to ask if Wall Street overreacted, as it is wont to do. After all, most of the decline happened on a single day last month following a disappointing earnings announcement.So, letâs take a look at Spirit to see if we might have a value opportunity.REIT Ticker Price/FFO Div Yield Payout Ratio Realty Income O 18.8 4.6% 83% National Retail Properties NNN 15.9 4.8% 74% STORE Capital STOR 12.4 5.7% 70% Spirit Realty Capital SRC 9.7 9.6% 90%On paper, Spirit looks cheap relative to its peers in the triple-net retail space. SRC stockÂ trades for 9.7 times its expected 2017 funds from operations (FFO), which is about half the valuation of industry leader Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O). For the uninitiated, FFO is a measure of earnings for REITs that strips out non-cash expenses such as depreciation. You can think of the Price/FFO ratio as the REIT equivalent of the Price/Earnings or P/E ratio.  Warren Buffett's 7 Best Dividend Stocks for Retirement  Likewise, Spiritâs dividend yield is significantly higher than its peers. Its yield is double that of National Retail Properties, Inc. (NYSE:NNN) and more than double that of Realty Income.Of course, an extremely high dividend yield is usually a sign of trouble aheadâ¦ and a sign that the market expects a dividend cut. Indeed, Spiritâs dividend currently eats up 90% of its FFO, and thatâs cutting it close. So, weâre likely looking at zero dividend growth over the next few years.ToÂ be clear, I donât consider SRCÂ to be at immediate risk of a dividend cut, at least asÂ long as it avoids a major tenant bankruptcy. More on that later.Why the Discount?So, weâve established that Sprit Realty Capital is cheap, at least relative to its peers. The next question is why?It comes back to Amazon and the death of retail. One of Spiritâs largest tenants is the struggling retail chain Shopko, which is having to close stores. Shopko is responsible for 8.1% of Spiritâs revenue, so any major setback here could make it difficult for Spirit to continue paying its dividend at current levels. Spirit announced higher-than-expected impairment charges in early May related to Shopko and other struggling tenants and also lowered its earnings guidance and reduced its expansion plans as a result. That lead to the massive rout in the stock price.But, is it justified?Letâs imagine the worst happened and Shopko stopped paying rent at all of its locations at the same time. That revenue isnât lost âforever.â Spirit could either sell the stores or find new tenants. But that could also take several months, and finding quality big-box tenants isnât particularly easy these days.  Is Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock an Unstoppable Behemoth?  So, weâre not talking about a cataclysmic, company-ending disaster. But, it would be something that would likely cause Spirit to substantially lower its dividend.A more likely scenario would be that Spirit muddles through, taking additional impairment charges over the next few quarters, but manages to keep its dividend intact, albeit barely. Assuming no major, unexpected hiccups, Spirit will probably modestly outperform its safer but more expensive peers.
