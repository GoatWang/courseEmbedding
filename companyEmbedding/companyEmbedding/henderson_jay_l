        CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORESteve Lavin's plan was to bring 6-foot-5 wing Jay Henderson on at St. John's as a freshman walk-on, then put him on scholarship before the 2015-16 season.But when St. John's dismissed Lavin after the season, Henderson needed a new plan -- and school.Enter Louisville. After a campus visit to U of L earlier this week, Henderson pledged to walk on with the Cardinals, he confirmed to The Courier-Journal late Thursday evening.On Friday, Henderson said his relationship with U of L assistant Kenny Johnson, who has strong ties to Henderson's former AAU team, Team Takeover, opened up the possibility of joining the Cards."They were looking for another guard who can play immediately," Henderson said. "If I come every day, work hard and do what I do defensively, and shoot the ball, there are minutes available."5-star wing V.J. King commits to U of LThe coincidence of another walk-on named Henderson won't be lost on the U of L community. Tim Henderson etched his name in Cards history with a pair of critical 3-pointers in the 2013 Final Four win against Wichita State and earned a scholarship in his final semester at U of L.Jay Henderson hopes for the same path, and he does come to Louisville with some pedigree. A Lake Highland Prep product, Henderson had scholarship offers from Florida State, Memphis, Mississippi State, George Mason and Murray State, among others, according to 247Sports.com."Right away, I can bring defense," Henderson said. "I take a lot of pride in defense ... I know they like to press a lot. That'll be a big factor for me -- playing defense. Plus, I consider myself a great shooter. I'll be able to stretch the floor out."It's unclear if a scholarship is there sometime in the future for Henderson, but for now, his focus is just getting on campus and starting class. He said he'll be at U of L in July.
