A development agreement is a document used when an individual or company (''Developer'') is entering into a development project with an individual or company (''Company''), to create a new product. For example, this type of agreement might be used if one technology company agreed to provide development services for another technnology company. Alternatively, a restaurant chain can also use this type of agreement when entering into a business relationship with a franchisee.
The agreement is meant to protect the intellectual property of the parties, and designates certain rights and responsibilities between the parties. A development agreement usually includes information regarding obligations, compensation, and how costs shall be distributed. Stipulations regarding which party will provide materials and said materials will be handled, may also be included.  Stipulations regarding which party will provide materials and said materials will be handled, may also be included. 
The agreement may include language for ownership of all prototypes, notebooks, reports, and other related items for the development project. Insurance, indemnification clauses, and rights to termination of the agreement are also typically included in a development agreement.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.
