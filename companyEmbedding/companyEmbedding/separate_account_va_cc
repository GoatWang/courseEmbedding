What is a 'Separate Account'
A separate account is a privately managed investment account opened through a brokerage or financial advisor that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. 2. In the context of variable annuities, these are payments made to an insurance company for the purpose of investing in securities. These securities are kept separate from the insurer's general investments. 

BREAKING DOWN 'Separate Account'
1. This differs from a mutual fund because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most separate accounts require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.

Separate account

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

This article does not cite any sources. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


A separate account is a segregated accounting and reporting account held by an insurance company not in, but rather "separate" from its general account. A separate account allows an investor to choose an investment category according to his individual risk tolerance, and desire for performance. An account may be a generic conservative or aggressive investment allocation, or a specific mutual fund-type account. Some offshore companies allow the account owners to specify the type of separate account to open.
Separate accounts in the U.S. markets are often characterized as either managed or non-managed. A managed separate account is synonymous to a mutual fund in the sense that the investments of the separate account are actively managed (such as stocks, bonds or other debt instruments, loans, derivative instruments, etc.). A non-managed separate account is one that invests more "passively" in that it typically owns shares of other managed pools of investments such as mutual fund shares. This is similar to a "fund of funds" whereby the separate account ("fund") simply invests in shares of one or more mutual funds. This arrangement is sometimes more efficient and cost-effective rather than the insurance company maintaining many separate accounts with similar baskets of securities.
Separate accounts are sometimes confused with separately managed accounts (SMAs), which are privately managed investment accounts opened through a brokerage or financial adviser that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. These differ from mutual funds because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most SMAs require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.

Allstate Life Insurance Company: No-Action Letter dated December 23, 2002
















Home | Previous Page






























No-Action Letter under
Securities Act of 1933 - Sections 5 and 8
Allstate Life Insurance Company
December 23, 2002
Reponse of the Office of Insurance Products
Division of Investment Management
Allstate Life Insurance Company, et al.
Based on the facts and representations in your letter dated December 23, 2002 and in an application for an exemptive order under Sections 6(c) and 17(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), and without necessarily agreeing with your legal analysis, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against Allstate Life Insurance Company ("Allstate"), Northbrook Life Insurance Company ("Northbrook") or Morgan Stanley DW Inc. under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act,"), if the Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A (the "Northbrook Life Separate Account") is transferred to Allstate, where it will change its name to Allstate Life Separate Account A, in connection with the proposed merger of Northbrook into Allstate (the "Merger").  We also would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder, or Section 11 of the 1940 Act, if the Northbrook Variable Annuity Account and Northbrook Variable Annuity Account II (the "Northbrook VA Accounts") are merged with Allstate Financial Advisors Separate Account I ("Allstate Separate Account I") (the "Separate Account Mergers") in connection with the Merger.  In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if (1) the change in depositor of the Northbrook Life Separate Account as a result of the Merger is effected though the filing of an amendment to the registration statement for the Northbrook Life Separate Account under the 1940 Act; and (2) new registration statements under the 1933 Act are filed by Allstate, the Northbrook Life Separate Account and Allstate Separate Account I to cover any securities issued after the Merger in connection with variable life insurance contracts funded by the Northbrook Life Separate Account and any variable annuity contracts funded by Allstate Separate Account I.
Further, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder if, without registration under the 1933 Act, Northbrook transfers to Allstate assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under certain fixed annuity contracts with market value adjustment features, as a result of which Allstate would assume all of the obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under such contracts.
In addition, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if, after consummation of the Merger, Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Separate Account A (formerly Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A), and the other parties named in the exemptive orders cited in your letter, continue to rely on such orders without filing amended or new applications for the same relief previously granted.
Because our position is based on facts and representations in your letter, you should note that different facts or representations may require a different conclusion. Further, this response expresses the position of the Division on enforcement only, and does not purport to express any legal conclusions on the issues presented.
Alison Toledo
Senior Counsel


[Foley:Lardner Attorneys at Law letterhead]

December 23, 2002
1933 Act/Section 5 and Rule 145
1940 Act/Sections 8 and 11
BY HAND DELIVERY
William J. Kotapish, Esq.
Assistant Director
Office of Insurance Products
Division of Investment Management
Securities and Exchange Commission
450 Fifth Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20549-0506
Re:  Allstate Life Insurance Company,
Northbrook Life Insurance Company, and
Morgan Stanley DW Inc.
Dear Mr. Kotapish: 
We are writing on behalf of Allstate Life Insurance Company ("Allstate"), Northbrook Life Insurance Company ("Northbrook"), and Morgan Stanley DW Inc. ("MSDW") to request that the staff advise us that it would not recommend enforcement action to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") in connection with the merger of Northbrook into its parent, Allstate (the "Merger"), described below.  This letter replaces our letter to you of August 30, 2002, and reflects changes agreed upon with the Commission staff.
Specifically, Allstate, Northbrook, and MSDW are seeking the staff's assurances that it would not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action:
under Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and Rule 145 thereunder, or Sections 8 and 11 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), if Northbrook Life Variable Life Separate Account A ("Northbrook Life Separate Account") is transferred intact to Allstate, as described below (the "Separate Account Transfer"); 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder or Section 11 of the 1940 Act if Northbrook Variable Annuity Account ("Northbrook VA") and Northbrook Variable Annuity Account II ("Northbrook VA II," together with Northbrook VA, the "Northbrook VA Accounts") merge with Allstate Financial Advisors Separate Account I ("Allstate Separate Account I") and consolidate any duplicative sub-accounts ("consolidated sub-accounts"), as described below (the "Separate Account Mergers"); 
under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder if, with respect to certain market value adjustment contracts (the "Northbrook MVA Contracts"),  Northbrook transfers to Allstate assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts, and Allstate assumes all the obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under such Contracts, as described below (the "Fixed Account Transfer"); and  
after consummation of the Merger, if Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, and certain others described herein continue to rely on the exemptive orders identified herein obtained on behalf of Northbrook, the Northbrook  Separate Accounts, and any other parties named therein without the filing or submission of amended or new applications for the same exemptive relief.
The Merger, Separate Account Transfer, Separate Account Mergers, and Fixed Account Transfer comprise the "Proposed Transactions," as referred to herein. 
I. Facts
Representatives of the companies involved have advised us of the facts set out below.
A. Allstate
Allstate is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Illinois in 1957.  Allstate's home office is located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Allstate is licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York.  Allstate currently has two registered separate accounts one of which, as described  below, will be involved in the Proposed Transactions.  At December 31, 2001, Allstate had approximately $44 billion in general and separate account assets on a statutory basis. 
Allstate is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate Insurance Company, a stock property-liability insurance company incorporated under the laws of Illinois. All of the outstanding capital stock of Allstate Insurance Company is owned by The Allstate Corporation. 
Allstate is the depositor of Allstate Separate Account I.
B. Northbrook
Northbrook is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of Arizona in 1998.  Previously, from 1978 to 1998, Northbrook was organized under the laws of the State of Illinois. Northbrook's headquarters are located at 3100 Sanders Road, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062. Northbrook is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Allstate.  Northbrook is currently licensed to operate in the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and all states except New York.  Northbrook currently has four registered separate accounts that are described below. At December 31, 2001, Northbrook had approximately $6.4 billion in general and separate account assets on a statutory basis.  
Northbrook and Allstate entered into a reinsurance agreement effective December 31, 1987. Under the reinsurance agreement, Allstate reinsures all of Northbrook's liabilities under its annuity and life insurance contracts.
Northbrook is the depositor of the Northbrook VA Accounts and the Northbrook Life Separate Account.
C. Separate Accounts and Contracts
Allstate Separate Account I was created pursuant to Illinois law and is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.1 Units of interest in Allstate Separate Account I are registered under the 1933 Act.2  Allstate Separate Account I funds two Allstate variable annuity contracts ("Allstate Contracts"). The Allstate Contracts are currently offered for sale in all states where Allstate is licensed. 
The Northbrook VA Accounts and the Northbrook Life Separate Account (collectively, the "Northbrook Separate Accounts") were created under Arizona law and each is registered as a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act.3   The Northbrook VA Accounts fund six variable annuity contracts ("Northbrook VA Contracts"), and Northbrook Life Separate Account funds one variable life insurance contract ("Northbrook VLI Contract," and, together with the Northbrook VA Contracts and the Northbrook MVA Contracts, the "Northbrook Contracts"). Units of interest in each Northbrook Separate Account are registered under the 1933 Act.4 
All of the Northbrook Contracts are currently offered for sale in all states where Northbrook is licensed, with the exception of the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity, the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity II, and the Morgan Stanley Variable Annuity II AssetManager.5   The Northbrook VA and VLI Contracts generally permit additional payments and allow transfers among sub-accounts, subject to certain conditions.
The above separate accounts consist of sub-accounts, each of which invests exclusively in shares of a portfolio of an open-end, diversified management investment company registered under the 1940 Act (each, an "Underlying Fund," collectively, the "Underlying Funds").  Currently, Allstate Separate Account I consists of 59 sub-accounts, Northbrook Life Separate Account consists of 20 sub-accounts, Northbrook VA consists of 11 sub-accounts, and Northbrook VA II consists of 53 sub-accounts. Several of the sub-accounts available under the Northbrook VA Contracts and the Allstate Contracts invest in the same Underlying Funds; however, those sub-accounts each have different accumulation unit values due to the different charges imposed under those Contracts.  Each of the Allstate Contracts and Northbrook Contracts also offer one or more general account options that are not registered under the 1933 Act. 
D. Northbrook MVA Contracts
The Northbrook MVA Contracts are flexible premium deferred fixed annuity contracts that are offered to individuals and to eligible groups. They have no variable investment options.  Northbrook holds assets attributable to the reserves it must maintain for, and its other liabilities with respect to, the Northbrook MVA Contracts in a non-unitized separate account that is not registered under the 1940 Act.  Market value adjustment interests in the Northbrook MVA Contracts are registered under the 1933 Act.6
E. Underwriter 
MSDW, a wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co., is the principal underwriter for the Northbrook Contracts.  MSDW was organized under the laws of Delaware in 1968.  MSDW is registered with the Commission under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
II. The Proposed Transactions
A. The Merger
Northbrook will merge with and into Allstate, with Allstate as the surviving corporation, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Articles of Merger (collectively, the "Merger Agreement") approved by the Boards of Directors of Allstate and Northbrook.  The Merger is subject to approval by the insurance departments of Arizona and Illinois, the states of domicile for Northbrook and Allstate, respectively.  Allstate and Northbrook expect to consummate the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, and the Fixed Account Transfer, on or about January 1, 2003 (the "Effective Date").
As a result of the Merger, Allstate will assume legal ownership of all of the assets of the Northbrook Separate Accounts and will become directly liable for Northbrook's liabilities and obligations with respect to the Northbrook Contracts then outstanding.7  Each Northbrook Contract owner will become a contract owner of Allstate by operation of law.  The Merger will not affect the provisions of, or the rights and obligations under, the Northbrook Contracts. Moreover, the Merger will not dilute or otherwise adversely affect the economic interests of the owners of the Northbrook Contracts, nor will the Merger affect the values determined under the Northbrook Contracts.  The Merger will not affect any current Allstate Contract owners.
No charges will be imposed on, or other deductions made from, the Northbrook Separate Accounts or Allstate Separate Account I in connection with the Merger.  In addition, no payments will be required or charges imposed under the Northbrook Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger that would not otherwise be required or imposed.8
No new investment options will be made available to owners of the Northbrook Contracts in connection with, or by virtue of, the Merger, nor will any existing investment options be substituted or terminated. Each sub-account of the Northbrook Separate Accounts will continue to invest in the same Underlying Fund as that sub-account invested in prior to the Merger. 
The Merger will not directly affect any of the Underlying Funds. The Underlying Funds will not be a party to the Merger or any related transaction. The investment objectives, policies, and restrictions of the Underlying Funds will not be changed as a result of the Merger or any related transaction.   No investment portfolios are proposed to be added to, substituted by, or terminated by the Underlying Funds in connection with the Merger or any related transaction.  Moreover, the Merger will not result in any change to the investment advisers for the Underlying Funds, the Underlying Funds' assets, or the charges imposed on the Underlying Funds or their shareholders.  In addition, the Merger will not result in a change in the principal underwriter for the Northbrook Contracts. 
Allstate and Northbrook have determined that no provision of the Northbrook Contracts or state law provides the owners of those Contracts ("Northbrook Contract owners") with any right to opt-out of, or to vote on or otherwise consent to, the Merger. Rather, the only required votes are those of the sole voting stockholders of the merging companies.  Moreover, none of the events affecting the Northbrook Separate Accounts in connection with the Merger require a vote of Northbrook Contract owners under the 1940 Act. In addition, as described above, the investment options and contractual rights and obligations under the Northbrook Contracts will not change, except that Allstate will become the depositor of the Northbrook Separate Accounts. Consequently, Northbrook Contract owners will have no investment decision to make with respect to the Merger.   
After the Merger, Allstate intends to accept additional payments under the transferred Northbrook Contracts outstanding at the time the Merger is effected, and to continue offering new contracts that are identical to the Northbrook Contracts currently being offered, but for the change in depositor.  Allstate will administer the Northbrook Contracts in the same manner as did Northbrook immediately prior to the Merger. 
All costs of the Merger will be borne by Allstate or an affiliate and not by any owners of Northbrook or Allstate Contracts (each, a "Contract owner," and collectively, the "Contract owners"). 
B. The Separate Account Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Northbrook Life Separate Account will transfer intact to Allstate and become part of Allstate on the Effective Date.  It will change its name to Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and have Allstate as its depositor rather than Northbrook. No other changes to Northbrook Life Separate Account will result from the Merger.  
The assets and liabilities that comprise Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately prior to the Merger will remain intact and legally separate from any other business of Allstate, as the surviving company, after the Merger.  In addition, Northbrook Life Separate Account will continue to fund the same Contracts it did immediately prior to the Merger. 
C. The Separate Account Mergers
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Northbrook VA Accounts will merge with Allstate Separate Account I on the Effective Date.  To achieve administrative efficiencies and cost savings, Allstate will consolidate any duplicative sub-accounts that invest in the same Underlying Fund. 
The consolidation of the sub-accounts will take place at their respective net asset values and each Northbrook Contract owner holding units of interest in one of the merging sub-accounts will have those units exchanged for units of equal value in the corresponding surviving sub-account.9   The values of the exchanged interests under the Contracts will thus be equivalent.  The accumulation unit values for these sub-accounts will not change, and the Contract value of any affected Contract owner immediately after the sub-account consolidation will be the same as the value immediately before the sub-account consolidation. 
The Separate Account Mergers will not affect the sub-accounts of the Northbrook Separate Accounts that are not duplicative.  Those sub-accounts will remain intact within Allstate Separate Account I and their net asset values immediately after the Merger will be the same as they were immediately before the Merger.  
D. The Fixed Account Transfer
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Northbrook will transfer assets equal to its reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts to Allstate, and Allstate will assume Northbrook's obligations under such Contracts, on the Effective Date. As a result of the Merger,  each non-unitized separate account of Northbrook that funds the Northbrook MVA Contracts will become a non-unitized separate account of Allstate. At the same time, Allstate will assume legal ownership of the fixed account assets of Northbrook and become responsible for all the liabilities and obligations of Northbrook under the Northbrook MVA Contracts issued prior to the Merger. 
The Fixed Account Transfer will not change the terms of the Northbrook MVA Contracts, except for the succession of Allstate as the insurer under the Northbrook MVA Contracts, and it will not adversely affect the values determined under, or the economic interests of the owners of, those Contracts. 
E. Procedural Matters
Allstate will file new registration statements on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable, under the 1933 Act to reflect the change in depositor of the Northbrook Separate Accounts and Allstate's assumption, pursuant to the Merger, of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Northbrook under the Northbrook VA Contracts and Northbrook VLI Contract. Allstate will seek to have the new registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date.  Existing Northbrook Contract owners (other than Northbrook VLI Contract owners) will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects Allstate's sponsorship of the Northbrook Separate Accounts as a result of the Merger.  New Contract owners will receive a revised prospectus that reflects the change in depositor.  Northbrook VLI Contract owners will receive a new Form N-6 prospectus that reflects the change in depositor.
Allstate also will file new registration statements on Form S-3 under the 1933 Act for the Northbrook MVA Contracts.  Allstate will seek to have the registration statements declared effective on or immediately following the Effective Date. These new registration statements would reflect Allstate's assumption of the contractual obligations and liabilities of Northbrook with respect to the Northbrook MVA Contracts pursuant to the Merger.  Each person who owns a Northbrook MVA Contract at the time of the Fixed Account Transfer will receive a prospectus supplement that reflects Allstate as the issuer of the Contract.  New Contract owners will receive a revised prospectus reflecting the change in insurer.
In compliance with applicable state law, Allstate, and Northbrook will notify the owners of the Northbrook Contracts that Allstate has assumed all obligations and responsibilities of Northbrook under those Contracts.
Following the Effective Date, Allstate will not make offers or accept purchase payments under the Northbrook Contracts until the new registration statements filed with the Commission are effective.
III. Discussion
For the reasons discussed below, we are of the view that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder do not apply to the Proposed Transactions.  We also are of the view, as discussed below, that Section 8 of the 1940 Act does not apply to the Separate Account Transfer, and that Section 11 of the 1940 Act does not apply to the Separate Account Transfer or the Separate Account Mergers.  Finally, we are of the view that the exemptive relief previously granted to Northbrook and other named parties prior to the Merger10 may continue to be relied upon after the Merger by Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and the other named parties without the need for the filing or submission of amended or duplicative exemptive applications. 
The staff has responded favorably to no-action requests dealing with the provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act noted above regarding transactions similar to the Separate Account Transfer,11 the Separate Account Mergers,12  and the Fixed Account Transfer.13 We respectfully submit that the Proposed Transactions are analogous to and pose no different issues than those presented in the transactions described in those no-action requests.
A. Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder Do Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, or the Fixed Account Transfer
1. Separate Account Transfer
In our view, the Separate Account Transfer would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security or in the creation of a new or different investment company issuer for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder.   
The Separate Account Transfer would not change the Northbrook VLI Contracts, except that, by operation of law, Allstate would succeed Northbrook as the depositor of Northbrook Life Separate Account and co-issuer of the Contracts and would, accordingly, guarantee the rights and benefits provided by the Contracts.14 These rights and benefits (e.g., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) would remain the same but would be guaranteed directly by Allstate's larger pool of assets. Cash values under the Northbrook VLI Contracts that are allocated to the Northbrook Life Separate Account would remain funded by the same pool of assets that presently constitutes the Separate Account, and its sub-accounts would continue to invest in the same Underlying Funds.  The unit values under the Northbrook VLI Contracts offered by Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A immediately after the Separate Account Transfer would be the same as under the Contracts offered by Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately before. The Separate Account Transfer, therefore, would not affect those aspects of the Northbrook VLI Contracts that cause interests thereunder to be treated as securities, e.g., the investment options available through the Separate Account.
The Separate Account Transfer would have no effect on the Northbrook Life Separate Account, except for the succession of Allstate as depositor and co-issuer described above, and except for the change in name of that Separate Account to Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A. The assets and liabilities that comprise the Northbrook Life Separate Account immediately before the Separate Account Transfer would remain intact and legally segregated from all other business of Allstate.   The financial history of the Northbrook Life Separate Account would be carried forward, and, with the exception of the assumption of liabilities by Allstate, would not change. 
As discussed above, Contract owners will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, and will not, by virtue of the Merger, have available any new or different investment options. Consequently, Contract Owners will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the Separate Account Transfer.  
Based on the foregoing, we believe that Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 14515 thereunder do not apply to the Separate Account Transfer. 
2. Separate Account Mergers
In our view, the Separate Account Mergers would not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder.   
The Separate Account Mergers would not result in any change to the Northbrook VA Contracts, except that Allstate would succeed Northbrook as depositor and as co-issuer of the Contracts. The rights and benefits under the Northbrook VA Contracts would remain the same, all of the sub-accounts of the Northbrook VA Accounts would continue to invest in the same Underlying Funds, the Northbrook VA Contract values immediately following the Merger will be the same as immediately before, and Contract owners would not be asked to make a new investment decision, since their vote or consent is not required in connection with the Merger. 
The change in depositor following the Merger does not change the nature of the securities outstanding.  The identity of the depositor is relevant to investors primarily because the depositor makes guarantees that are in the nature of insurance obligations. For example, the depositor, in effect, guarantees to make up any shortfall in separate account assets to pay any death benefit, notwithstanding that the benefit might be greater than the amount of account value supporting the contract in question, and to make annuity payments for whatever period is contractually required, regardless of whether the relevant contract's account value has already been depleted thereby.  We respectfully submit, therefore, that the difference in depositors is a difference that relates almost exclusively to the insurance guarantees under the Northbrook Contracts, rather than to those aspects of the Contracts that constitute (or cause the Contracts to be) securities. This argues strongly against the conclusion that the existence of a different depositor necessarily gives rise to a different security.  
Moreover, even if the Separate Account Mergers were deemed to involve the issuance of  new or different securities, such issuance would not be registrable under the terms of Section 5 or Rule 145, because Contract owners do not have any discretion about whether or not to participate in the Separate Account Mergers.  Accordingly, the Contract owners will not be called upon to make the kind of investment decision that historically has been deemed necessary for an "offer" or "sale" to occur that would bring Section 5 into play.  Nor, in this case, will there be the kind of security holder action that, under the terms of the rule, is required to bring Rule 145 into play.
3. Fixed Account Transfer 
In our view, the Fixed Account Transfer will not result in the offer or sale of any new or different security for purposes of Section 5 of the 1933 Act.
No change will be made to the Northbrook MVA Contracts by virtue of the Fixed Account Transfer, except that Allstate will succeed Northbrook as the insurance company responsible for providing the rights and benefits under the Northbrook MVA Contracts. These rights and benefits (i.e., surrender rights, annuity options, death benefits, etc.) will remain the same.  Northbrook will transfer its non-unitized separate accounts that hold assets supporting the reserves and other liabilities under the Northbrook MVA Contracts intact to Allstate. Consequently, when the Fixed Account Transfer becomes effective, Allstate will hold these assets in the same non-unitized separate accounts in which they were held prior to the transfer.
As discussed above, owners of Northbrook MVA Contracts will not have the opportunity to opt-out of or to vote on or consent to the Fixed Account Transfer and will not, by virtue of the Fixed Account Transfer, have available any new or different investment options. Consequently, owners of Northbrook MVA Contracts will have no new investment decision to make in connection with the Fixed Account Transfer.
B. Section 8 of the 1940 Act Does Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer
In our view, the succession of Allstate to the position of depositor for the Northbrook Life Separate Account as a result of the Merger will not result in the organization or creation of any new investment company pursuant to Section 8 of the 1940 Act.   
The Merger will cause a change in the depositor of the Northbrook Life Separate Account, which will involve a change in the co-issuer of the units of interest under variable life insurance contracts funded through that Separate Account.  However, the change in depositor will not change the structure or operation of the Northbrook Life Separate Account or its relationship to the insurance company issuing the Northbrook VLI Contracts or to the Contract owners.  The Northbrook Life Separate Account would continue to be treated as a separate entity for all relevant purposes, including financial reporting.  
The Commission's "ectoplasmic" theory,16 in our view, supports the position that Northbrook Life Separate Account, as such, will have a continuing, uninterrupted existence, notwithstanding the change of the insurance company serving as its depositor and having legal ownership of its assets. Although the assets of Northbrook Life Separate Account will become assets of Allstate, such assets will remain intact in a legally separate account, and, for financial reporting purposes, the Separate Account will be treated as a continuing separate entity. 
Accordingly, to reflect the change in legal ownership of the assets of the Northbrook Life Separate Account from Northbrook to Allstate following the consummation of the Merger, Allstate and the Separate Account will file a new registration statement on Form N-6 that will constitute an amendment to the Separate Account's existing registration under the 1940 Act.  The Form N-6 registration statement also will register, under the 1933 Act, any securities transactions effected under the Northbrook VLI  Contracts after the Merger.  Allstate will file the Form N-6 registration statement to ensure that it will become effective on or about the effective date of the Merger. 
C. Section 11 of the 1940 Act Does Not Apply to the Separate Account Transfer and the Separate Account Mergers
Based on the foregoing analysis, we also believe that the Separate Account Transfer does not involve an exchange of securities (the separate account interests in the Northbrook VLI Contracts) issued by an investment company (the Northbrook VLI Separate Account) for securities of any other investment company for purposes of Section 11 of the 1940 Act.   In addition, for the reasons discussed above, we believe that the Separate Account Mergers do not involve an "offer of exchange" within the meaning of Section 11.   However, should the Separate Account Transfer or the Separate Account Mergers be viewed as including an offer of exchange of investment company securities within the meaning of Section 11, we believe that such transactions would comply with the requirements of Section 11(a) and Rule 11a-2(b)(2) thereunder, because any such exchange would be effected at relative net asset values. Thus, Commission approval of such transactions should not be required under Section 11 of the 1940 Act. 
D. Continued Reliance on Prior Exemptive Relief Is Appropriate
We believe the exemptions under the 1940 Act17 that Northbrook, the Northbrook Separate Accounts, and the other parties named therein have received from the Commission or its staff should continue to apply after the Merger to Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and other parties named therein, to the extent they continue to be relied upon, without the filing with the Commission of amended or duplicative applications for the same relief.  Their continued applicability is appropriate because the Merger will not change the operations of Allstate Separate Account I, nor its relationship to its depositor, any other separate account, or Contract owners.  The only changes  resulting from the Merger are: (i) the substitution of Allstate for Northbrook as depositor for the Northbrook Separate Accounts and as co-issuer and insurer of the Northbrook Contracts, (ii) the transfer of the sub-accounts of the Northbrook Separate Accounts to Allstate Separate Account I, (iii) the transfer of Northbrook Life Separate Account to Allstate, and (iv) the consolidation of the transferred sub-accounts that invest in the same Underlying Funds.  It is our view that such changes have no impact upon, and are not relevant to, the exemptions that were previously granted or the justifications for those exemptions.  In support of our view, we note that the Commission staff has taken a favorable position on similar requests in several no-action letters.18
IV. No-Action Request
Based upon the above facts and circumstances, we respectfully request that the Commission staff issue a letter stating that it will not recommend that the Commission take any enforcement action under Section 5 of the 1933 Act and Rule 145 thereunder in connection with the Merger, including the Separate Account Transfer, the Separate Account Mergers, and the Fixed Account Transfer, or under Section 8 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Separate Account Transfer, and Section 11 of the 1940 Act in connection with the Separate Account Transfer and the Separate Account Mergers.
In addition, we request that the staff advise us that the exemptive orders cited herein, to the extent they continue to be relied upon, will continue to be applicable after the Effective Date, in the manner described above, to Allstate, Allstate Separate Account I, Allstate Life Variable Life Separate Account A, and to the parties named therein without the filing of amended or duplicative applications for the same exemptions for the same assurance.
If you have any questions or require further information with respect to this matter, please call me, Chip Lunde (202-295-4016), or Charles Smith of Allstate (847-402-1790).
Very truly yours,

14  Some state insurance departments will require an endorsement to outstanding policies to reflect the change of issuer. 
15   Rule 145 under the 1933 Act provides, in pertinent part, that certain business combinations, including certain mergers, consolidations, and transfers of assets, will be deemed to involve the "offer" or "sale" of securities requiring registration under the Act under circumstances where existing security holders are in effect asked to make an investment decision whether to accept a new or different security in exchange for a security they presently own. Even if the Merger were deemed to be a "transfer of assets" for purposes of Rule 145, it is clear that the Rule does not apply because the Contract owners are not being asked to vote on or to consent to the transaction. For these reasons, we believe that Rule 145 is inapplicable to the Merger.

PROVIDIAN LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY SEPARATE ACCOUNT V      
PROSPECTUS
FOR 
THE ADVISOR'S EDGE VARIABLE ANNUITY 
OFFERED BY
PROVIDIAN LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY     
(A MISSOURI STOCK COMPANY)
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES
P.O. BOX 32700
LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY 40232

The Advisor's Edge variable annuity contract (the "Contract"), offered through  
Providian Life and Health Insurance Company (the "Company", "us", "we" or       
"our"), provides a vehicle for investing on a tax-deferred basis in 20          
investment company Portfolios and our General Account. The Contract is an       
individual variable annuity contract and is intended for retirement savings or  
other long-term investment purposes.                                            

The minimum initial Purchase Payment for Non-Qualified Contracts is $5,000. The 
minimum initial purchase payment for Qualified Contracts is $2,000 (or $50      
monthly by payroll deduction). The Contract is a flexible-premium deferred      
variable annuity that provides for a Right to Cancel Period of 10 days (30 days 
or more in some instances) during which you may cancel your investment in the   
Contract.                                                                       

Your Net Purchase Payments for the Contract may be allocated among 20           
Subaccounts of Providian Life and Health Insurance Company's Separate Account V 
and three fixed options available under the Company's General Account. Assets   
of each Subaccount are invested in one of the following Portfolios (which are   
contained within five open-end, diversified investment companies):

Depending upon the state of issue and provisions of your Contract, your initial 
Net Purchase Payment(s) will, when your Contract is issued, either be (i)       
invested in Federated's Prime Money Portfolio during your Right to Cancel       
Period and/or invested immediately in your chosen Guaranteed Index Rate Options 
or (ii) invested immediately in your chosen Portfolios and fixed options (other 
than the Five-Year Guaranteed Equity Option).                                   

The Contract's Accumulated Value varies with the investment performance of the  
Portfolios you select. You bear all investment risk associated with the         
Portfolios. Investment results for your Contract are not guaranteed except to   
the extent a portion of the Accumulated Value is allocated to the General       
Account.                                                                        

The Contract offers a number of ways of withdrawing monies at a future date,    
including a lump sum payment and several Annuity Payment Options. Full or       
partial withdrawals of the Contract's Surrender Value may be made at any time,  
although in many instances withdrawals made prior to age 59 1/2 are subject to  
a 10% penalty tax (and a portion may be subject to ordinary income taxes). If   
you elect an Annuity Payment Option, Annuity Payments may be received on a      
fixed and/or variable basis. You also have significant flexibility in choosing

GLOSSARY

Accumulation Unit - A measure of your ownership interest in the Contract prior  
to the Annuity Date.                                                            

Accumulation Unit Value - The value of each Accumulation Unit which is          
calculated each Valuation Period.                                               

Accumulated Value - The value of all amounts accumulated under the Contract     
prior to the Annuity Date.                                                      

Adjusted Death Benefit - The sum of all Net Purchase Payments made during the   
first six Contract Years, less any partial withdrawals taken. During each       
subsequent six-year period, the Adjusted Death Benefit will be the Death        
Benefit on the last day of the previous six-year period plus any Net Purchase   
Payments made, less any partial withdrawals taken during the current six-year   
period. After the Annuitant attains age 75, the Adjusted Death Benefit will     
remain equal to the Death Benefit on the last day of the six-year period before 
age 75 occurs plus any Net Purchase Payments subsequently made, less any        
partial withdrawals subsequently taken.                                         

Annual Contract Fee - The $30 annual fee charged by the Company to cover the    
cost of administering each Contract. The Annual Contract Fee will be deducted   
on each Contract Anniversary and upon surrender, on a pro rata basis, from each 
Subaccount.

Annuity Payments and upon whose death, prior to the Annuity Date, benefits      
under the Contract are paid.

over time. Under a Variable Annuity Option (see "Annuity Payment Options," page 
24), the dollar amount of each Annuity Payment may change over time, depending  
upon the investment experience of the Portfolio or Portfolios you choose.       
Annuity Payments are based on the Contract's Accumulated Value as of 10         
Business Days prior to the Annuity Date.                                        

Annuity Unit - Unit of measure used to calculate Variable Annuity Payments (see

Death Benefit - The greater of the Contract's Accumulated Value on the date the 
Company receives due Proof of Death of the Annuitant or the Adjusted Death

Index Rate Option, that portion of the Accumulated Value will be adjusted by a  
positive Market Value Adjustment Factor (see "Five-Year Guaranteed Index Rate

The Contract provides a vehicle for investing on a tax-deferred basis in 20     
investment company Portfolios and three General Account Guaranteed Options      
offered by the Company. Monies may be subsequently withdrawn from the Contract  
either as a lump sum or as annuity income as permitted under the Contract.      
Accumulated Values and Annuity Payments depend on the investment experience of  
the selected Portfolios and/or the guarantees of the General Account Guaranteed 
Options. The investment performance of the Portfolios is not guaranteed. Thus,  
you bear all investment risk for monies invested under the Contract except to   
the extent of the portion of your Accumulated Value allocated to the General    
Account.                                                                        

WHO SHOULD INVEST                                                               

The Contract is designed for investors seeking long term, tax-deferred          
accumulation of funds, generally for retirement but also for other long-term    
investment purposes. The tax-deferred feature of the Contract is most           
attractive to investors in high federal and state marginal income tax brackets. 
The Contract is offered as both a Qualified Contract and a Non-Qualified        
Contract. Both Qualified and Non-Qualified Contracts offer tax-deferral on      
increases in the Contract's value prior to withdrawal or distribution; however, 
Purchase Payments made by Contract Owners of Qualified Contracts may be         
excludible or deductible from gross income in the year such payments are made,  
subject to certain statutory restrictions and limitations. (See "Federal Tax
Considerations")....................................................Page 27

Your investment in the Contract may be allocated among 20 Subaccounts of the    
Separate Account and/or the General Account Guaranteed Options. The Subaccounts 
in turn invest exclusively in the following 20 Portfolios offered by the Funds:

International Value Portfolio, the DFA International Small Portfolio, the DFA   
Short-Term Fixed Portfolio, the DFA Global Bond Portfolio, Federated's Equity

Cap Advisor Portfolio, the Wanger International Small Cap Advisor Portfolio,    
the Weiss, Peck & Greer Core Large-Cap Stock Portfolio and the Weiss, Peck &    
Greer Core Small-Cap Stock Portfolio. The assets of each Portfolio are          
separate, and each Portfolio has distinct investment objectives and policies as 
described in the corresponding Fund Prospectus......................Page 11

The Contract Owner may designate any person to receive benefits under the       
Contract which are payable upon the death of the Annuitant prior to the Annuity 
Date.

ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PAYMENTS 

If the state of issue of your Contract is CA, GA, ID, LA, MI, MO, NE, NH, NC,   
OK, SC, UT, VA or WV, then your initial Net Purchase Payment(s) will, when your 
Contract is issued, be invested in Federated's Prime Money Portfolio until the  
expiration of the Right to Cancel Period and then invested according to your    
initial allocation instructions (except that any accrued interest will remain   
in Federated's Prime Money Portfolio if it is selected as an initial allocation 
option), provided that you may elect to have the portion of your initial Net    
Purchase Payment(s) allocated to the Guaranteed Index Rate Options invested     
immediately upon our receipt thereof in order to lock in the rates then         
applicable to such options.                                                     

If the state of issue of your Contract is any other state, then depending on    
the applicable provisions of your Contract, your initial Net Purchase           
Payment(s) will, unless you indicate otherwise, be invested in your Portfolios  
and Guaranteed Index Rate Options immediately upon our receipt thereof, IN      
WHICH CASE YOU WILL BEAR FULL INVESTMENT RISK FOR ANY AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO THE  
PORTFOLIOS DURING THE RIGHT TO CANCEL PERIOD. (Please note that this automatic  
immediate investment feature only applies if your Contract so specifies. The    
Company does not expect to issue Contracts with this immediate investment       
feature until the fourth quarter of 1995 at the earliest. Please check with     
your agent to determine the status of your Contract. Also, immediate investment

RIGHT TO CANCEL PERIOD 

The Contract provides for a Right to Cancel Period of 10 days (30 or more days  
in some instances as specified in your Contract), during which you may cancel   
your investment in the Contract. To cancel your investment, please return your  
Contract to us or to the agent from whom you purchased the Contract. When we    
receive the Contract, (1) if the state of issue of your Contract is CA, GA, ID, 
LA, MI, MO, NE, NH, NC, OK, SC, UT, VA or WV, then for any amount of your       
initial Purchase Payment(s) invested in Federated's Prime Money Portfolio, we   
will return the Accumulated Value of the amount of your Purchase Payment(s) so  
invested, or if greater, the amount of your Purchase Payment(s) so invested,    
(2) for any amount of your initial Purchase Payment(s) invested in the          
Portfolios immediately following receipt by us, we will return the Accumulated  
Value of your Purchase Payment(s) so invested plus any fees and/or Premium      
Taxes that may have been subtracted from such amount, and (3) for any amount of 
your initial Purchase Payment(s) invested in the Guaranteed Index Rate Options

Payment(s) so invested..............................................Page 16     

EXCHANGES 

You may make unlimited Exchanges among the Portfolios or into the General       
Account Guaranteed Options, provided you maintain a minimum balance of $1,000   
in each Subaccount or General Account Guaranteed Option to which you have       
allocated a portion of your Accumulated Value. A $15 fee is currently imposed   
for Exchanges in excess of 12 per Contract Year. Exchanges must not reduce the  
value of any Subaccount or General Account Guaranteed Option below $1,000, or   
that remaining amount will be transferred to your other Subaccounts or          
Guaranteed Index Rate Options on a pro rata basis. The Five-Year Guaranteed     
Equity Option is illiquid for the entire five-year guarantee period, and        
transfers from the General Account Guaranteed Options may be subject to         
additional limitations and charges. (See also "Charges and Deductions," page    
17, and "The General Account," page 20).............................Page 18     

DEATH BENEFIT 

If the Annuitant specified in your Contract dies prior to the Annuity Date,     
your named Annuitant's Beneficiary will receive the Death Benefit under the     
Contract. The Death Benefit is the greater of your Accumulated Value (plus any  
positive Market Value Adjustment applicable under the Five-Year Guaranteed      
Index Rate Option) or the Adjusted Death Benefit on the date we receive due     
proof of the Annuitant's death. During the first six Contract Years, the        
Adjusted Death Benefit will be the sum of all Net Purchase Payments made, less  
any partial withdrawals taken. During each subsequent six-year period, the      
Adjusted Death Benefit will be the Death Benefit on the last day of the         
previous six-year period plus any Net

Purchase Payments made, less any partial withdrawals taken during the current   
six-year period. After the Annuitant attains age 75, the Adjusted Death Benefit 
will remain equal to the Death Benefit on the last day of the six-year period   
before age 75 occurs plus any Net Purchase Payments subsequently made, less any 
partial withdrawals subsequently taken. The Annuitant's Beneficiary may elect   
to receive these proceeds as a lump sum or as Annuity Payments. If the          
Annuitant dies on or after the Annuity Date, any unpaid payments certain will   
be paid, generally to the Annuitant's Beneficiary, in accordance with the       
Contract............................................................Page 25     

ANNUITY PAYMENT OPTIONS 

In addition to the full and partial withdrawal privileges, you may also choose  
to create an income stream by requesting an annuity income from us. As the      
Contract Owner, you may elect one of several Annuity Payment Options. By        
electing an Annuity Payment Option, you are asking us to systematically         
liquidate your Contract. We provide you with a variety of options as it relates 
to those payments. At your discretion, payments may be either fixed or variable 
or both. Fixed payouts are guaranteed for a designated period or for life       
(either single or joint). Variable payments will vary depending on the          
performance of the underlying Portfolio or Portfolios selected......Page 25

STANDARDIZED AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN 

When advertising performance of the Subaccounts, the Company will show the      
Standardized Average Annual Total Return for a Subaccount which, as prescribed  
by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), is the          
effective annual compounded rate of return that would have produced the cash    
redemption value over the stated period had the performance remained constant   
throughout. The Standardized Average Annual Total Return assumes a single       
$1,000 payment made at the beginning of the period and full redemption at the   
end of the period. It reflects the deduction of the Annual Contract Fee and all 
other Portfolio, Separate Account and Contract level charges except Premium     
Taxes, if any.                                                                  

ADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES

TOTAL RETURN 
The Company may show actual Total Return (i.e., the percentage change in the    
value of an Accumulation Unit) for one or more Subaccounts with respect to one  
or more periods. The Company may also show actual Average Annual Total Return   
(i.e., the average annual change in Accumulation Unit Values) with respect to   
one or more periods. For one year, the actual Total Return and the actual       
Average Annual Total Return are effective annual rates of return and are equal. 
For periods greater than one year, the actual Average Annual Total Return is    
the effective annual compounded rate of return for the periods stated. Because  
the value of an Accumulation Unit reflects the Separate Account and Portfolio   
expenses (see Fee Table above), the actual Total Return and actual Average      
Annual Total Return also reflect these expenses. These percentages, however, do 
not reflect the Annual Contract Fee or Premium Taxes (if any) which, if         
included, would reduce the percentages reported.                                

NON-STANDARDIZED HYPOTHETICAL TOTAL RETURN AND NON-STANDARDIZED HYPOTHETICAL 
AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN 
The Company may show Non-Standardized Hypothetical Total Return and Non-        
Standardized Hypothetical Average Annual Total Return, calculated on the basis  
of the historical performance of the Portfolios, and may assume the Contract    
was in existence prior to its inception date (which it was not). After the      
Contract's inception date, the calculations will reflect actual Accumulation    
Unit Values. These returns are based on specified premium patterns which        
produce the resulting Accumulated Values. They reflect a deduction for the      
Separate Account expenses and Portfolio expenses. They do not include the       
Annual Contract Fee or Premium Taxes (if any) which, if included, would reduce  
the percentages reported.                                                       

The Non-Standardized Annual Total Return for a Subaccount is the effective      
annual rate of return that would have produced the ending Accumulated Value of  
the stated one-year period.                                                     

The Non-Standardized Average Annual Total Return for a Subaccount is the        
effective annual compounded rate of return that would have produced the ending  
Accumulated Value over the stated period had the performance remained constant  
throughout.                                                                     

YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD 
The Company may also show yield and effective yield figures for the Subaccount  
investing in shares of Federated's Prime Money Portfolio. "Yield" refers to the 
income generated by an investment in Federated's Prime Money Portfolio over a   
seven-day period, which is then "annualized." That is, the amount of income     
generated by the investment during that week is assumed to be generated each    
week over a 52-week period and is shown as a percentage of the investment. The  
"effective yield" is calculated similarly but, when annualized, the income      
earned by an investment in Federated's Prime Money Portfolio is assumed to be   
reinvested. Therefore the effective yield will be slightly higher than the      
yield because of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment. These     
figures do not reflect the Annual Contract Fee or Premium Taxes (if any) which, 
if included, would reduce the yields reported.                                  

From time to time a Portfolio of a Fund may advertise its yield and total       
return investment performance. For each Subaccount other than Federated's Prime 
Money Market for which the Company advertises yield, the Company shall furnish  
a yield quotation referring to the Portfolio computed in the following manner:  
the net investment income per Accumulation Unit earned during a recent one      
month period is divided by the Accumulation Unit Value on the last day of the   
period.

comparable variable annuity separate accounts or other investment products      
surveyed by Lipper Analytical Services, a nationally recognized independent     
reporting service which ranks mutual funds and other investment companies by    
overall performance, investment objectives and assets. Performance may also be  
tracked by other ratings services, companies, publications or persons who rank  
separate accounts or other investment products on overall performance or other

THE COMPANY AND THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT 
PROVIDIAN LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY                                     
The Company is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of    
Missouri on August 6, 1920. The Company is principally engaged in offering life 
insurance, annuity contracts, and accident and health insurance and is admitted 
to do business in 49 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The      
Company is wholly-owned, directly and indirectly, by Providian Corporation, a   
publicly-held diversified consumer financial services company whose shares are  
traded on the New York Stock Exchange with assets of $23.6 billion as of        
December 31, 1994.                                                              

PROVIDIAN LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY SEPARATE ACCOUNT V                  

The Separate Account was established by the Company as a separate account under 
the laws of the State of Missouri on February 14, 1992, pursuant to a           
resolution of the Company's Board of Directors. The Separate Account is a unit  
investment trust registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of    
1940 (the "1940 Act"). Such registration does not signify that the SEC          
supervises the management or the investment practices or policies of the        
Separate Account. The Separate Account meets the definition of a "separate      
account" under the federal securities laws.                                     

The assets of the Separate Account are owned by the Company and the obligations 
under the Contract are obligations of the Company. These assets are held        
separately from the other assets of the Company and are not chargeable with     
liabilities incurred in any other business operation of the Company (except to  
the extent that assets in the Separate Account exceed the reserves and other    
liabilities of the Separate Account). Income, gains and losses incurred on the  
assets in the Separate Account, whether or not realized, are credited to or     
charged against the Separate Account without regard to other income, gains or   
losses of the Company. Therefore, the investment performance of the Separate    
Account is entirely independent of the investment performance of the General    
Account assets or any other separate account maintained by the Company.         

The Separate Account has dedicated 20 Subaccounts to the Contract, each of      
which invests solely in a corresponding Portfolio of the Funds. Additional      
Subaccounts may be established at the discretion of the Company. The Separate   
Account also includes other subaccounts which are not available under the       
Contract.

select companies which have the potential to gain market share in their

comparable quality. This Portfolio may invest up to 35% of its total assets in  
corporate bonds and debentures rated BBB by S&P or Baa by Moody's at the time   
of purchase. Such securities are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay 
interest and repay principal, but adverse economic conditions or changing       
economic circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay    
interest and repay principal. Such securities are thought to possess            
speculative characteristics. Under normal market conditions, this Portfolio     
will invest at least 65% of its total assets in bonds. Securities comprising    
the Portfolio will have an aggregate average weighted maturity of five to ten   
years. As a result of its investment strategies, the Portfolio's annual         
Portfolio turnover rate is expected to exceed 100%. Such a rate, if achieved,   
will lead to higher transaction costs. Western Asset Management Company acts as 
the investment sub-advisor for the SEI Intermediate Fixed Income Portfolio.

The investment objective of the Wanger U.S. Small Cap Advisor Portfolio is to   
seek long-term growth of capital. The Portfolio pursues its investment          
objective by investing primarily in stocks of small and medium size United      
States companies.

investment objective by investing primarily in stocks of small and medium size  
foreign companies.                                                              

WEISS, PECK & GREER CORE LARGE-CAP STOCK FUND ("WEISS, PECK & GREER CORE LARGE- 
CAP STOCK PORTFOLIO") AND WEISS, PECK & GREER CORE SMALL-CAP STOCK FUND       
("WEISS, PECK & GREER CORE SMALL-CAP STOCK PORTFOLIO")                        

The investment objective of the Weiss, Peck & Greer Core Large-Cap Stock        
Portfolio is to seek to exceed the performance of publicly traded large         
capitalization stocks in the aggregate, as represented by the S&P 500. The S&P  
500 is an unmanaged index of 500 common stocks. The S&P 500 represents          
approximately 70% of the total domestic U.S. equity market capitalization. The  
investment objective of the Core Small-Cap Stock Portfolio is to seek to exceed 
the performance of publicly traded small capitalization stocks in the           
aggregate, as represented by the Russell 2000. The Russell 2000 is an unmanaged 
index of 2000 common stocks of small capitalization companies. Each of these    
Portfolios pursues its investment objective by investing in a portfolio of      
securities that is considered more "efficient" than the applicable benchmark.   
An efficient portfolio is one that has the maximum expected return for any      
level of risk. While each Portfolio will generally be substantially fully       
invested in equity securities which comprise the applicable benchmark, each     
Portfolio may invest up to 10% of its total assets in fixed-income securities   
that are rated at the time of investment at least AA by S&P or Aa by Moody's or 
their respective equivalents or, if not rated, determined to be of equivalent   
credit quality to securities so rated.                                          

OTHER PORTFOLIO INFORMATION                                                     

There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its stated investment       
objective.                                                                      

Additional information concerning the investment objectives and policies of the 
Portfolios and the investment advisory services, total expenses and charges can 
be found in the current prospectuses for the corresponding Funds. The Funds'    
prospectuses should be read carefully before any decision is made concerning    
the allocation of Net Purchase Payments to a Portfolio.                         

The Portfolios may be made available to registered separate accounts offering   
variable annuity and variable life products of the Company as well as other     
insurance companies or to a person or plan, including a pension or retirement   
plan receiving favorable tax treatment under the Code, that qualifies to        
purchase shares of the Funds under Section 817(h) of the Code. Although we      
believe it is unlikely, a material conflict could arise among the interests of  
the Separate Account and one or more of the other participating separate        
accounts and other qualified persons or plans. In the event of a material       
conflict, the affected insurance companies agree to take any necessary steps,   
including removing their separate accounts from the Funds if required by law,   
to resolve the matter.

CONTRACT FEATURES 

The rights and benefits under the Contract are described below and in the       
Contract. The Company reserves the right to make any modification to conform    
the Contract to, or give the Contract Owner the benefit of, any federal or      
state statute or any rule or regulation of the United States Treasury           
Department.                                                                     

RIGHT TO CANCEL PERIOD 

A Right to Cancel Period exists for a minimum of 10 days after you receive the  
Contract (30 or more days in some instances as set forth in your Contract). The 
Contract permits you to cancel the Contract during the Right to Cancel Period   
by returning the Contract to our Administrative Offices, P.O. Box 32700,        
Louisville, Kentucky 40232 or to the agent from whom you purchased the          
Contract. Upon cancellation, the Contract is treated as void from the Contract  
Date and when we receive the Contract, (1) if the state of issue of your        
Contract is CA, GA, ID, LA, MI, MO, NE, NH, NC, OK, SC, UT, VA or WV, then for  
any amount of your initial Purchase Payment(s) invested in Federated's Prime    
Money Portfolio, we will return the Accumulated Value of the amount of your     
Purchase Payment(s) so invested, or if greater, the amount of your Purchase     
Payment(s) so invested, (2) for any amount of your initial Purchase Payment(s)  
invested in the Portfolios immediately following receipt by us, we will return  
the Accumulated Value of your Purchase Payment(s) so invested plus any fees     
and/or Premium Taxes that may have been subtracted from such amount, and (3)    
for any amount of your initial Purchase Payment(s) invested in the Guaranteed   
Index Rate Options immediately following receipt by us, we will refund the      
amount of your Purchase Payment(s) so invested.                                 

CONTRACT APPLICATION AND PURCHASE PAYMENTS 

If an applicant wishes to purchase a Contract, the applicant should send his or 
her completed application and initial Purchase Payment to the address indicated 
on the application, or to such other location as the Company may from time to   
time designate. If the applicant wishes to make personal delivery by hand or    
courier to the Company of the completed application and initial Purchase        
Payment (rather than through the mail), he or she must do so at our             
Administrative Offices at 400 West Market Street, Louisville, KY 40202. The     
initial Purchase Payment for a Non-Qualified Contract must be equal to or       
greater than the $5,000 minimum investment requirement. The Initial Purchase    
Payment for a Qualified Contract must be equal to or greater than $2,000 (or    
you may establish a payment schedule of $50 a month by payroll deduction).      

The Contract will be issued and the initial Purchase Payment less any Premium   
Taxes will be credited within two Business Days after acceptance of the         
application and the initial Purchase Payment. Acceptance is subject to the      
application being received in good order, and the Company reserves the right to 
reject any application or initial Purchase Payment.                             

If the initial Purchase Payment cannot be credited because the application is   
incomplete, we will contact the applicant, explain the reason for the delay and 
will refund the initial Purchase Payment within five Business Days, unless the  
applicant instructs us to retain the initial Purchase Payment and credit it as  
soon as the necessary requirements are fulfilled.                               

Additional Purchase Payments may be made at any time prior to the Annuity Date, 
as long as the Annuitant is living. Additional Purchase Payments must be for at 
least $1,000 for Non-Qualified Contracts, or $50 for Qualified Contracts.       
Additional Purchase Payments received prior to the close of the New York Stock  
Exchange (generally 4:00 P.M. Eastern time) are credited to the Accumulated     
Value at the close of business that same day. Additional Purchase Payments      
received after the close of the New York Stock Exchange are processed the next  
Business Day.                                                                   

Total Purchase Payments may not exceed $1,000,000 without our prior approval.   

PURCHASING BY WIRE 

For wiring instructions please contact our Administrative Offices at 1-800-866- 
6007.                                                                           

ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PAYMENTS 

You specify in the Contract application how your Net Purchase Payments will be  
allocated. You may allocate each Net Purchase Payment to one or more of the     
Portfolios or General Account Guaranteed Options as long as such portions are   
whole number percentages provided that each allocation to a General Account     
Guaranteed Option is at least $1,000

and that no Portfolio or General Account Guaranteed Option may contain a        
balance less than $1,000. You may choose not to allocate any monies to a        
particular Portfolio. You may change allocation instructions for future Net     
Purchase Payments by sending us the appropriate Company form or by complying    
with other designated Company procedures.                                       

If the state of issue of your Contract is CA, GA, ID, LA, MI, MO, NE, NH, NC,   
OK, SC, UT, VA or WV, then your initial Net Purchase Payment(s) will, when your 
Contract is issued, be invested in Federated's Prime Money Portfolio until the  
expiration of the Right to Cancel Period (which is assumed for this purpose to  
be 15 to 35 days (i.e., a 10 to 30 day Right to Cancel Period plus a five day   
grace period to allow for mail delivery) or more in some instances as specified 
in your Contract after the issuance of your Contract) and then invested         
according to your initial allocation instructions (except that any accrued      
interest will remain in Federated's Prime Money Portfolio if it is selected as  
an initial allocation option), provided that you may elect to have the portion  
of your initial Net Purchase Payment(s) allocated to the Guaranteed Index Rate  
Options invested immediately upon our receipt thereof in order to lock in the   
rates then applicable to such options.                                          

If the state of issue of your Contract is any other state, then depending on    
the applicable provisions of your Contract, your initial Net Purchase           
Payment(s) will, unless you indicate otherwise, be invested in your Portfolios  
and Guaranteed Index Rate Options immediately upon our receipt thereof, IN      
WHICH CASE YOU WILL BEAR FULL INVESTMENT RISK FOR ANY AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO THE  
PORTFOLIOS DURING THE RIGHT TO CANCEL PERIOD. (Please note that this automatic  
investment feature only applies if your Contract so specifies. The Company does 
not expect to issue Contracts with this immediate investment feature until the  
fourth quarter of 1995 at the earliest. Please check with your agent to         
determine the status of your Contract. Also, immediate investment is not        
available with respect to any amounts allocated to THE FIVE-YEAR GUARANTEED     
EQUITY OPTION WHICH IS ILLIQUID FOR FIVE YEARS.)                                

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS 

There are no sales charges for the Contracts (although certain charges or       
restrictions may apply to your Contract's General Account Guaranteed Options).  

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE 

We impose a charge as compensation for bearing certain mortality and expense    
risks under the Contracts. The annual charge is assessed daily based on the net 
asset value of the Separate Account. The annual mortality and expense risk      
charge is .50% of the net asset value of the Separate Account.                  

We guarantee that this annual charge will never increase. If this charge is     
insufficient to cover actual costs and assumed risks, the loss will fall on us. 
Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient, any excess will be added 
to the Company surplus and will be used for any lawful purpose, including any   
shortfall on the costs of distributing the Contracts.                           

The mortality risk borne by us under the Contracts, where one of the life       
Annuity Payment Options is selected, is to make monthly Annuity Payments        
(determined in accordance with the annuity tables and other provisions          
contained in the Contract) regardless of how long all Annuitants may live. We   
also assume mortality risk as a result of our guarantee of a Death Benefit in   
the event the Annuitant dies prior to the Annuity Date.                         

The expense risk borne by us under the Contracts is the risk that the charges   
for administrative expenses which are guaranteed for the life of the Contract   
may be insufficient to cover the actual costs of issuing and administering the  
Contract.                                                                       

ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE AND ANNUAL CONTRACT FEE                                   

An administrative charge equal to .15% annually of the net asset value of the   
Separate Account is assessed daily along with the Annual Contract Fee of $30.   
These costs are deducted proportionately from the Contract's Accumulated Value; 
therefore, the $30 fee is assessed per Contract, not per Portfolio chosen. The  
Annual Contract Fee will be deducted on each Contract Anniversary and upon      
surrender, on a pro rata basis, from each Subaccount. These deductions          
represent reimbursement for the costs expected to be incurred over the life of  
the Contract for issuing and maintaining each Contract and the Separate         
Account.

EXCHANGES 

Each Contract Year you may make an unlimited number of Exchanges between        
Portfolios and/or General Account Guaranteed Options, provided that after an    
Exchange no Portfolio or General Account Guaranteed Option may contain a        
balance less than $1,000. A $15 fee is currently imposed for Exchanges in       
excess of 12 per Contract Year.                                                 

EXCEPTIONS TO CHARGES 

The administrative charges or fees may be reduced for sales of Contracts to a   
trustee, employer or similar entity representing a group where the Company      
determines that such sales result in savings of administrative expenses. In     
addition, directors, officers and bona fide full-time employees (and their      
spouses and minor children) of the Company, its ultimate parent company,        
Providian Corporation and certain of their affiliates are permitted to purchase 
Contracts with substantial reduction of administrative charges or fees.         
Contracts so purchased are for investment purposes only and may not be resold   
except to the Company.                                                          

In no event will reduction or elimination of fees or charges be permitted where 
such reduction or elimination will be unfairly discriminatory to any person.    
Additional information about reductions in charges is contained in the          
Statement of Additional Information.                                            

TAXES                                                                           

We will, where such taxes are imposed on the Company by state law, deduct       
Premium Taxes that currently range up to 3.5%. These taxes will be deducted     
from the Accumulated Value or Purchase Payments in accordance with applicable   
law.                                                                            

As of the date of this Prospectus, the following states assess a Premium Tax on 
all initial and additional Purchase Payments:

In addition, a number of states currently impose Premium Taxes at the time an   
Annuity Payment Option (other than a Lump Sum Payment Option) is selected. As   
of the date of this Prospectus, the following states assess a Premium Tax       
against the Accumulated Value if the Contract Owner chooses an Annuity Payment  
Option instead of receiving a lump sum distribution:

Under present laws, the Company will incur state or local taxes (in addition to 
the Premium Taxes described above) in several states. At present, the Company   
does not charge the Contract Owner for these taxes. If there is a change in     
state or local tax laws, charges for such taxes may be made. The Company does   
not expect to incur any federal income tax liability attributable to investment 
income or capital gains retained as part of the reserves under the Contracts.   
(See "Federal Tax Considerations," page 27.) Based upon these expectations, no  
charge is currently being made to the Separate Account for corporate federal    
income taxes that may be attributable to the Separate Account.                  

18

P-->485APOS22nd Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 22nd
The Company will periodically review the question of a charge to the Separate   
Account for federal income taxes related to the Separate Account. Such a charge 
may be made in future years for any federal income taxes incurred by the        
Company. This might become necessary if the tax treatment of the Company is     
ultimately determined to be other than what the Company currently believes it   
to be, if there are changes made in the federal income tax treatment of         
annuities at the corporate level, or if there is a change in the Company's tax  
status. In the event that the Company should incur federal income taxes         
attributable to investment income or capital gains retained as part of the      
reserves under the Contracts, the Accumulated Value of the Contract would be    
correspondingly adjusted by any provision or charge for such taxes.             

PORTFOLIO EXPENSES                                                              

The value of the assets in the Separate Account reflect the fees and expenses   
paid by the Portfolios. A complete description of these expenses is found in    
the "Fee Table" section of this Prospectus and in each Fund's Prospectus and    
Statement of Additional Information.                                            

ACCUMULATED VALUE 

At the commencement of the Contract, the Accumulated Value equals the initial   
Net Purchase Payment. Thereafter, the Accumulated Value equals the Accumulated  
Value from the previous Business Day increased by: (i) any additional Net       
Purchase Payments received by the Company and (ii) any increase in the          
Accumulated Value due to investment results of the selected Portfolio(s) and    
the interest credited to the General Account Guaranteed Options during the      
Valuation Period; and reduced by: (i) any decrease in the Accumulated Value due 
to investment results of the selected Portfolio(s), (ii) a daily charge to      
cover the mortality and expense risks assumed by the Company, (iii) any charge  
to cover the cost of administering the Contract, (iv) any partial withdrawals,  
(v) any Market Value Adjustment or other deduction due to early Exchanges or    
withdrawals from the Guaranteed Index Rate Options and, if exercised by the     
Company, (vi) any charges for any Exchanges made after the first 12 in any      
Contract Year.                                                                  

EXCHANGES AMONG THE PORTFOLIOS 

Should your investment goals change, you may exchange Accumulated Value among   
the Portfolios of the Funds and, as permitted, the General Account Guaranteed   
Options. Requests for Exchanges, received by mail or by telephone, prior to the 
close of the New York Stock Exchange (generally 4:00 P.M. Eastern time) are     
processed at the close of business that same day. Requests received after the   
close of the New York Stock Exchange are processed the next Business Day. If    
you experience difficulty in making a telephone Exchange your Exchange request  
may be made by regular or express mail. It will be processed on the date        
received.                                                                       

To take advantage of the privilege of initiating transactions by telephone, you 
must first elect the privilege by completing the appropriate section of the     
application or by completing a separate telephone authorization form at a later 
date. To take advantage of the privilege of authorizing a third party to        
initiate transactions by telephone, you must first complete a third party       
authorization form.                                                             

The Company will undertake reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions   
communicated by telephone are genuine. Prior to the acceptance of any request,  
the caller will be asked by a customer service representative for his or her    
Contract number and social security number. In addition, telephone              
communications from a third party authorized to transact in an account will     
undergo reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions are genuine. The     
third party caller will be asked for his or her name, company affiliation (if   
appropriate), the Contract number to which he or she is referring, and the      
social security number of the Contract Owner. All calls will be recorded, and   
this information will be verified with the Contract Owner's records prior to    
processing a transaction. Furthermore, all transactions performed by a customer 
service representative will be verified with the Contract Owner through a       
written confirmation statement. Neither the Company nor the Funds shall be      
liable for any loss, cost or expense for action on telephone instructions that  
are believed to be genuine in accordance with these procedures.

THE GENERAL ACCOUNT 

Because of applicable exemptive and exclusionary provisions, interests in the   
General Account have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933       
("1933 Act"), nor under the 1940 Act. Thus, neither our General Account, nor    
any interest therein are generally subject to regulation under the provisions   
of the 1933 Act or the 1940 Act. Accordingly, the Company has been advised that 
the staff of the SEC has not reviewed the disclosure in this Prospectus         
relating to the General Account. These disclosures regarding the General        
Account may, however, be subject to certain generally applicable provisions of  
the federal securities laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of        
statements made in prospectuses.                                                

Note: The General Account Guaranteed Options are currently available for sale   
in most, but not all, states. Please check with your sales representative for   
details of the availability of these features before purchasing.                

The General Account contains all of the assets of the Company other than those  
in the separate accounts we establish. The Company has sole discretion to       
invest the assets of the General Account, subject to applicable law. Allocation 
of any amounts to the General Account does not entitle you to share directly in 
the investment experience of these assets.                                      

There are three fixed options under the General Account: the One-Year           
Guaranteed Index Rate Option, the Five-Year Guaranteed Index Rate Option, and   
the Five-Year Guaranteed Equity Option, each described below:                   

One-Year Guaranteed Index Rate Option 

You may allocate your Accumulated Value to this option at any time. The         
Accumulated Value you allocate under this option earns interest equal to 90% of 
the one-year constant maturity Treasury rate at the time your allocation is     
made with a guarantee that the Accumulated Value in this General Account        
Guaranteed Option will not be less than the amounts allocated, plus 3%.         

You may allocate any or all of your Accumulated Value from this General Account 
Guaranteed Option to any of the Subaccounts or other General Account Guaranteed 
Options at any time before the end of the one-year guarantee period. However,   
for any amounts so transferred we will deduct an amount equal to the interest   
the transferred value earned over the previous 90 days at the applicable one-   
year rate. For full and partial withdrawals of amounts allocated to this        
General Account Guaranteed Option prior to the end of the one-year guarantee    
period, we will deduct an amount equal to the interest earned on the amount     
withdrawn during the previous 90 days at the applicable one-year rate, subject  
to a guarantee that any amounts allocated to this General Account Guaranteed    
Option will earn interest of at least 3%.                                       

At the end of the one-year guarantee period, you may, without loss of interest, 
elect to transfer all or part of your Accumulated Value under this option to    
any of the Subaccounts or transfer to another General Account Guaranteed Option 
or renew your participation in this option. Notice of such an election must be  
provided to the Company no later than 15 days after the end of the one-year     
guarantee period (and each subsequent one-year guarantee period). If no such    
election is made, your Accumulated Value will automatically be renewed under    
this option for the next one-year guarantee period.                             

Five-Year Guaranteed Index Rate Option

You may allocate your Accumulated Value to this option at any time. The         
Accumulated Value you allocate under this option earns interest equal to 100%   
of the five-year constant maturity Treasury rate at the time your allocation is 
made with a guarantee that the Accumulated Value in this General Account        
Guaranteed Option will not be less than the amount initially allocated, plus    
3%, compounded annually.                                                        

You may allocate any or all of your Accumulated Value from this General Account 
Guaranteed Option to any of the Subaccounts or other General Account Guaranteed 
Options at any time before the end of the five-year guarantee period. However,  
for any amounts so transferred we will apply a Market Value Adjustment (as      
described below) against such amounts. For full and partial withdrawals of      
amounts allocated to this General Account Guaranteed Option prior to the end of 
the five-year guarantee period, we will apply a Market Value Adjustment (as     
described below) against such amounts withdrawn.

The Market Value Adjustment ("MVA") Factor for the Five-Year Guaranteed Index   
Rate Option will be as follows:                                                 

                                                                [Download Table]

 N                       X                                      (B - E)
---                                                             -------
12                                                               1 + E 

where N                                                                         
=the number of months left in the five-year guarantee period at the time  
of the transfer or surrender (including any partial months which will   
count as full months for purposes of this calculation).                 

B=the applicable five-year constant maturity Treasury rate at the beginning 
of the five-year guarantee period.                                      

E=the applicable five-year constant maturity Treasury rate at the time of   
the transfer or surrender.                                              

The MVA is applied to the Accumulated Value in order to determine the net       
amount of the transfer or surrender under this option. Generally, if the five-  
year constant maturity Treasury rate at the beginning of the five-year          
guarantee period is lower than the five-year constant maturity Treasury rate    
prevailing at the time of the transfer or surrender, then the application of    
the MVA will result in a lower payment upon transfer or surrender. Similarly,   
if the five-year constant maturity Treasury rate at the beginning of the five-  
year guarantee period is higher than the prevailing five-year constant maturity 
Treasury rate at the time of transfer or surrender, then the application of the 
MVA will result in a higher payment upon transfer or surrender.                 

The following is an example of how your Accumulated Value under the Five-Year   
Guaranteed Index Rate Option is affected by a positive Market Value Adjustment: 

Assume an initial allocation of $100,000 when the five-year constant maturity   
Treasury rate is 8%. At the end of 12 months, your Accumulated Value is         
$108,000. Assume also you surrender at the end of one year with 48 months of    
the guarantee period remaining and the five-year constant maturity Treasury     
rate is 7%.                                                                     

Accumulated Value = $108,000                                                

MVA Factor = 48 X .08 - .07 = 4 X .00935 = .0374                            
12  1 + .07                                         

Adjustment = $108,000 X .0374 = $4,039                                    

= $108,000 + $4,039 = $112,039 = Net amount of transfer or
surrender                                                 

The following is an example of how your Accumulated Value under the Five-Year   
Guaranteed Index Rate Option is affected by a negative Market Value Adjustment: 

Assume an initial allocation of $100,000 when the five-year constant maturity   
Treasury rate is 8%. At the end of 12 months, your Accumulated Value is         
$108,000. Assume also you surrender at the end of one year with 48 months       
remaining in the guarantee period and the five-year constant maturity Treasury  
rate is 9%.                                                                     

Accumulated Value = $108,000                                                

MVA Factor = 48 X .08 - .09 = 4 X -.00917 = -.0367                          
12  1 + .09                                         

Adjustment = $108,000 X -.0367 = -$3,964                                  

= $108,000 - $3,964 = $104,036 = Net amount of transfer or
surrender                                                 

Notwithstanding application of a negative Market Value Adjustment, any Net      
Purchase Payments allocated to this General Account Guaranteed Option will earn 
interest of at least 3%, compounded annually.                                   

At the end of the five-year guarantee period, you may, without loss of          
interest, elect to transfer any or all of your Accumulated Value under this     
option to any of the Subaccounts or transfer to another General Account         
Guaranteed Option or renew your participation in this option. Such election     
must be provided to the Company before the end of the five-year guarantee       
period (and each subsequent five-year guarantee period). If no election is      
made, your Accumulated Value will automatically be renewed under this option    
for the next five-year guarantee period.                                        

Five-Year Guaranteed Equity Option

You may allocate your Accumulated Value to this option as of the first business 
day of each month. During the five-year guarantee period applicable to          
Accumulated Value allocated to this option, we will credit interest at a        
guaranteed annual                                                               

21

P-->485APOS25th Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 25th
effective rate of 3%, compounded annually. At the end of the five-year          
guarantee period we will credit additional interest in an amount equal to the   
amount by which (a) exceeds (b), where: (a) equals the percentage change in the 
S&P 500(R) Composite Stock Price Index from the date Accumulated Value is       
allocated to the end of the five-year guarantee period, multiplied by the       
amount allocated; and (b) equals the total amount of interest credited during   
the five-year guarantee period. ("S&P 500(R)" is a trademark of Standard &      
Poor's Corporation and has been licensed for use by Providian Corporation.)     

THIS OPTION IS ILLIQUID FOR THE ENTIRE FIVE-YEAR GUARANTEE PERIOD AND,          
ACCORDINGLY, DOES NOT PERMIT ANY EXCHANGES OR REALLOCATIONS OF ACCUMULATED      
VALUE TO THE SUBACCOUNTS OR OTHER GENERAL ACCOUNT GUARANTEED OPTIONS OR FULL OR 
PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS DURING SUCH FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. However, during such          
guarantee period, the Accumulated Value allocated under this option may be      
annuitized under any of the Annuity Payment Options.                            

At the end of the five-year guarantee period, you may, without loss of          
earnings, elect to transfer all or part of your Accumulated Value under this    
option to any of the Subaccounts, transfer into another General Account         
Guaranteed Option or renew your participation in this option. Such election     
must be received by the Company no later than 30 days prior to the end of the   
five-year guarantee period. If no election is received, your Accumulated Value  
will automatically be transferred to Federated's Prime Money Portfolio. This    
option may not be available at all times.

The Five-Year Guaranteed Equity Option (the "GEO") is not sponsored,        
endorsed, sold or promoted by Standard & Poor's Corporation ("S&P"). S&P makes  
no representation or warranty, express or implied, to investors in the GEO or   
any member of the public regarding the advisability of investing in securities  
generally or in the GEO particularly or the ability of the S&P 500 Index to     
track general stock market performance. S&P's only relationship to Providian    
Life and Health Insurance Company is the licensing of certain trademarks and    
trade names of S&P and of the S&P 500 Index which is determined, composed and   
calculated by S&P without regard to Providian Life and Health Insurance Company 
or the GEO. S&P has no obligation to take the needs of Providian Life and       
Health Insurance Company or the investors in the GEO into consideration in      
determining, composing or calculating the S&P 500 Index. S&P is not responsible 
for and has not participated in the determination of the timing of, prices at,  
or quantities of the GEO to be issued or in the determination or calculation of 
the equation by which the GEO is to be converted into cash. S&P has no          
obligation or liability in connection with the administration, marketing or     
trading of the GEO.

INVESTORS IN THE GEO, OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FROM THE USE OF THE S&P 500 
INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN IN CONNECTION WITH THE RIGHTS LICENSED BY    
PROVIDIAN LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY OR FOR ANY OTHER USE. S&P MAKES NO  
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR USE WITH RESPECT TO THE  
S&P 500 INDEX OR ANY DATA INCLUDED THEREIN. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OF THE         
FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL S&P HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY SPECIAL, PUNITIVE,  
INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF NOTIFIED   
OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.                                             

FULL AND PARTIAL WITHDRAWALS 

At any time before the Annuity Date and while the Annuitant is living, you may  
make a partial or full withdrawal of the Contract to receive all or part of the 
Surrender Value by sending a written request to our Administrative Offices.     
Full or partial withdrawals may only be made before the Annuity Date and all    
partial withdrawal requests must be for at least $500. The amount available for 
full or partial withdrawal is the Surrender Value at the end of the Valuation   
Period during which the written request for withdrawal is received. The         
withdrawal amount may be paid in a lump sum to you, or if elected, all or any   
part may be paid out under an Annuity Payment Option. (See "Annuity Payment
Options," page 24.)                                                             

You can make a withdrawal by sending the appropriate Company form to our        
Administrative Offices. You may not make any full or partial withdrawals from   
the Five-Year Guaranteed Equity Option before the end of the five-year          
guarantee                                                                       

22

P-->485APOS26th Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 26th
period. Your proceeds will normally be processed and mailed to you within two   
Business Days after the receipt of the request but in no event will it be later 
than seven calendar days, subject to postponement in certain circumstances.     
(See "Deferment of Payment," page 26.)                                          

Payments under the Contract of any amounts derived from premiums paid by check  
may be delayed until such time as the check has cleared your bank. If, at the   
time the Contract Owner requests a full or partial withdrawal, he has not       
provided the Company with a written election not to have federal income taxes   
withheld, the Company must by law withhold such taxes from the taxable portion  
of any full or partial withdrawal and remit that amount to the federal          
government. Moreover, the Code provides that a 10% penalty tax may be imposed   
on certain early withdrawals. (See "Federal Tax Considerations," page 27.)      

Since the Contract Owner assumes the investment risk with respect to amounts    
allocated to the Separate Account, the total amount paid upon withdrawal of the 
Contract (taking into account any prior withdrawals) may be more or less than   
the total Net Purchase Payments made.                                           

SYSTEMATIC WITHDRAWAL OPTION 

You may choose to have a specified dollar amount provided to you on a regular   
basis from the portion of your Contract's Accumulated Value that is allocated   
to the Portfolios. By electing the Systematic Withdrawal Option, withdrawals    
may be made on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. The minimum   
amount for each withdrawal is $250.                                             

This option may be elected by completing the Systematic Withdrawal Request      
Form. This form must be received by us at least 30 days prior to the date       
systematic withdrawals will begin. Each withdrawal will be processed on the day 
and at the frequency indicated on the Systematic Withdrawal Request Form. The   
start date for the systematic withdrawals must be between the first and twenty- 
eighth day of the month. You may discontinue the Systematic Withdrawal Option   
at any time by notifying us in writing at least 30 days prior to your next      
scheduled withdrawal date.                                                      

Each systematic withdrawal is subject to federal income taxes on the taxable    
portion, and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if you are under age   
59 1/2. You may elect to have federal income taxes withheld from each           
withdrawal at a 10% rate on the Systematic Withdrawal Request Form. For a       
discussion of the tax consequences of withdrawals, see "Federal Tax
Considerations" on page 27 of your Prospectus. You may wish to consult a tax    
advisor regarding any tax consequences that might result prior to electing the  
Systematic Withdrawal Option.                                                   

We reserve the right to discontinue offering the Systematic Withdrawal Option   
upon 30 days written notice. We also reserve the right to charge a fee for such 
service.                                                                        

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING OPTION 

If you have at least $5,000 of Accumulated Value in Federated's Prime Money     
Portfolio, you may choose to have a specified dollar amount transferred from    
this Portfolio to other Portfolios in the Separate Account or to the General    
Account Guaranteed Options on a monthly basis. The main objective of Dollar     
Cost Averaging is to shield your investment from short term price fluctuations. 
Since the same dollar amount is transferred to other Portfolios each month,     
more units are purchased in a Portfolio if the value per unit is low and less   
units are purchased if the value per unit is high. Therefore, a lower average   
cost per unit may be achieved over the long term. This plan of investing allows 
investors to take advantage of market fluctuations but does not assure a profit 
or protect against a loss in declining markets.                                 

This Dollar Cost Averaging Option may be elected on the enrollment form or at a 
later date. The minimum amount that may be transferred each month into any      
Portfolio or General Account Guaranteed Option is $250. The maximum amount      
which may be transferred is equal to the Accumulated Value in Federated's Prime 
Money Portfolio when elected, divided by 12.                                    

The transfer date will be the same calendar day each month as the Contract      
Date. The dollar amount will be allocated to the Portfolios in the proportions  
you specify on the appropriate Company form, or, if none are specified, in      
accordance with your original investment allocation. If, on any transfer date,  
the Accumulated Value is equal to or less than the amount you have elected to   
have transferred, the entire amount will be transferred and the option will     
end. You may                                                                    

23

change the transfer amount once each Contract Year, or cancel this option by    
sending the appropriate Company form to our Administrative Offices which must   
be received at least seven days before the next transfer date.                  

IRS-REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS 

Prior to the Annuity Date, if you or, if applicable, a Joint Owner dies before  
the entire interest in the Contract is distributed, the value of the Contract   
must be distributed to the Owner's Designated Beneficiary (unless the Contract  
Owner was also the Annuitant--in which case the Annuitant's Beneficiary is      
entitled to the Death Benefit) as described in this section so that the         
Contract qualifies as an annuity under the Code. If the death occurs on or      
after the Annuity Date, the remaining portions of such interest will be         
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used  
as of the date of death. If the death occurs before the Annuity Date, the       
entire interest in the Contract will be distributed within five years after     
date of death or be paid under an Annuity Payment Option under which payments   
will begin within one year of the Contract Owner's death and will be made for   
the life of the Owner's Designated Beneficiary or for a period not extending    
beyond the life expectancy of that beneficiary. The Owner's Designated          
Beneficiary is the person to whom ownership of the Contract passes by reason of 
death.                                                                          

If any portion of the Contract Owner's interest is payable to (or for the       
benefit of) the surviving spouse of the Contract Owner, the Contract may be     
continued with the surviving spouse as the new Contract Owner.                  

MINIMUM BALANCE REQUIREMENT 

We will transfer the balance in any Portfolio that falls below $1,000, due to a 
partial withdrawal or Exchange, to the remaining Portfolios held under that     
Contract on a pro rata basis. In the event that the entire value of the         
Contract falls below $1,000, you may be notified that the Accumulated Value of  
your account is below the Contract's minimum requirement. You would then be     
allowed 60 days to make an additional investment before the account is          
liquidated. Proceeds would be promptly paid to the Contract Owner. The full     
proceeds would be taxable as a withdrawal. We will not exercise this right with 
respect to Qualified Contracts.                                                 

DESIGNATION OF AN ANNUITANT'S BENEFICIARY 

The Contract Owner may select one or more Annuitant's Beneficiaries and name    
them in the application. Thereafter, while the Annuitant is living, the         
Contract Owner may change the Annuitant's Beneficiary by sending us the         
appropriate Company form. Such change will take effect on the date such form is 
signed by the Contract Owner but will not affect any payment made or other      
action taken before the Company acknowledges such form. You may also make the   
designation of Annuitant's Beneficiary irrevocable by sending us the            
appropriate Company form and obtaining approval from the Company. Changes in    
the Annuitant's Beneficiary may then be made only with the consent of the       
designated irrevocable Annuitant's Beneficiary.                                 

If the Annuitant dies prior to the Annuity Date, the following will apply       
unless the Contract Owner has made other provisions.                            

(a) If there is more than one Annuitant's Beneficiary, each will share in   
the Death Benefits equally;                                         

(b) If one or two or more Annuitant's Beneficiaries have already died, that 
share of the Death Benefit will be paid equally to the survivor(s); 

(c) If no Annuitant's Beneficiary is living, the proceeds will be paid to   
the Contract Owner;                                                 

(d) If an Annuitant's Beneficiary dies at the same time as the Annuitant,   
the proceeds will be paid as though the Annuitant's Beneficiary had 
   died first. If an Annuitant's Beneficiary dies within 15 days after the
Annuitant's death and before the Company receives due proof of the  
Annuitant's death, proceeds will be paid as though the Annuitant's  
Beneficiary had died first.                                         

If an Annuitant's Beneficiary who is receiving Annuity Payments dies, any       
remaining payments certain will be paid to that Annuitant's Beneficiary's named 
beneficiary(ies) when due. If no Annuitant's Beneficiary survives the           
Annuitant, the right to any amount payable will pass to the Contract Owner. If  
the Contract Owner is the Annuitant, this right will pass to his or her estate. 
If a Life Annuity with Period Certain option was elected, and if the Annuitant  
dies on or after the Annuity Date, any unpaid payments certain will be paid to  
the Annuitant's Beneficiary or your designated Payee.

DEATH OF ANNUITANT PRIOR TO ANNUITY DATE 

If the Annuitant dies prior to the Annuity Date, an amount will be paid as      
proceeds to the Annuitant's Beneficiary. The Death Benefit is calculated and is 
payable upon receipt of due Proof of Death of the Annuitant as well as proof    
that the Annuitant died prior to the Annuity Date. Upon receipt of this proof,  
the Death Benefit will be paid within seven days, or as soon thereafter as the  
Company has sufficient information about the Annuitant's Beneficiary to make    
the payment. The Annuitant's Beneficiary may receive the amount payable in a    
lump sum cash benefit or under one of the Annuity Payment Options.              

The Death Benefit is the greater of:                                            

(1) The Accumulated Value on the date we receive due Proof of Death; or     

(2) The Adjusted Death Benefit.                                             

During the first six Contract Years, the Adjusted Death Benefit will be the sum 
of all Net Purchase Payments made, less any partial withdrawals taken. During   
each subsequent six-year period, the Adjusted Death Benefit will be the Death   
Benefit on the last day of the previous six-year period plus any Net Purchase   
Payments made, less any partial withdrawals taken during the current six-year   
period. After the Annuitant attains age 75, the Adjusted Death Benefit will     
remain equal to the Death Benefit on the last day of the six-year period before 
age 75 occurs plus any Net Purchase Payments subsequently made, less any        
partial withdrawals subsequently taken.                                         

ANNUITY DATE 

You may specify an Annuity Date in the application, which can be no later than  
the first day of the month after the Annuitant's 85th birthday, without the     
Company's prior approval. The Annuity Date is the date that Annuity Payments    
are scheduled to commence under the Contract unless the Contract has been       
surrendered or an amount has been paid as proceeds to the designated            
Annuitant's Beneficiary prior to that date.                                     

You may advance or defer the Annuity Date. However, the Annuity Date may not be 
advanced to a date prior to 30 days after the date of receipt of a written      
request or, without the Company's prior approval, deferred to a date beyond the 
first day of the month after the Annuitant's 85th birthday. The Annuity Date    
may only be changed by written request during the Annuitant's lifetime and must 
be made at least 30 days before the then-scheduled Annuity Date. The Annuity    
Date and the Annuity Payment options available for Qualified Contracts may also 
be controlled by endorsements, the plan or applicable law.                      

LUMP SUM PAYMENT OPTION 

You may surrender the Contract at any time while the Annuitant is living and    
before the Annuity Date. The Surrender Value is equal to the Accumulated Value, 
adjusted for any Market Value Adjustment or other deductions applicable to      
amounts allocated to a General Account Guaranteed Option, less any amount       
allocated to the Five-Year Guaranteed Equity Option, less any Premium Taxes     
incurred but not yet deducted.                                                  

ANNUITY PAYMENT OPTIONS 

All Annuity Payment Options (except for the Designated Period Annuity Option)   
are offered as "Variable Annuity Options." This means that Annuity Payments,    
after the initial payment, will reflect the investment experience of the        
Portfolio or Portfolios you have chosen. All Annuity Payment Options are also   
offered as "Fixed Annuity Options." This means that the amount of each payment  
will be set on the Annuity Date and will not change. The following Annuity      
Payment Options are available under the Contract:                               

Life Annuity--Monthly Annuity Payments are paid for the life of an Annuitant,   
ceasing with the last Annuity Payment due prior to the Annuitant's death.       

Joint and Last Survivor Annuity--Monthly Annuity Payments are paid for the life 
of two Annuitants and thereafter for the life of the survivor, ceasing with the 
last Annuity Payment due prior to the survivor's death.                         

Life Annuity with Period Certain--Monthly Annuity Payments are paid for the     
life of an Annuitant, with a Period Certain of not less than 120, 180, or 240   
months, as elected.                                                             

Installment or Unit Refund Life Annuity--Available as either a Fixed            
(Installment Refund) or Variable (Unit Refund) Annuity Option. Monthly Annuity  
Payments are paid for the life of an Annuitant, with a Period Certain           
determined by dividing the Accumulated Value by the first Annuity Payment.      

25

P-->485APOS29th Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 29th
Designated Period Annuity--Only available as a Fixed Annuity Option. Monthly    
Annuity Payments are paid for a Period Certain as elected, which may be from 10 
to 30 years.                                                                    

Before the Annuity Date and while the Annuitant is living, you may change the   
Annuity Payment Option by written request. The request for change must be made  
at least 30 days prior to the Annuity Date and is subject to the approval of    
the Company. If an Annuity Payment Option is chosen that depends on the         
continuation of the life of the Annuitant, proof of birth date may be required  
before Annuity Payments begin. For Annuity Payment Options involving life       
income, the actual age of the Annuitant will affect the amount of each payment. 
Since payments to older Annuitants are expected to be fewer in number, the      
amount of each Annuity Payment will generally be greater.                       

All or part of the Accumulated Value may be placed under one or more Annuity    
Payment Options. If Annuity Payments are to be paid under more than one option, 
the Company must be told what part of the Accumulated Value is to be paid under 
each option.                                                                    

If at the time of any Annuity Payment you have not provided the Company with a  
written election not to have federal income taxes withheld, the Company must by 
law withhold such taxes from the taxable portions of such Annuity Payment and   
remit that amount to the federal government.                                    

In the event that an Annuity Payment Option is not selected, the Company will   
make monthly Annuity Payments that will go on for as long as the Annuitant      
lives (120 payments guaranteed) in accordance with the Life Annuity with Period 
Certain Option and the annuity benefit sections of the Contract. That portion   
of the Accumulated Value that has been held in a Portfolio prior to the Annuity 
Date will be applied under a Variable Annuity Option based on the performance   
of that Portfolio. Subject to approval by the Company, you may select any other 
Annuity Payment Option then being offered by the Company. All Fixed Annuity     
Payments and the initial Variable Annuity Payment are guaranteed to be not less 
than as provided by the Annuity Tables and the Annuity Payment Option elected   
by the Contract Owner. The minimum payment, however, is $100. If the            
Accumulated Value is less than $5,000, or less than $2,000 for Texas Contract   
Owners, the Company has the right to pay that amount in a lump sum. From time   
to time, the Company may require proof that the Annuitant or Contract Owner is  
living. Annuity Payment Options are not available to: (1) an assignee; or (2)   
any other than a natural person, except with the consent of the Company.        

We may, at the time of election of an Annuity Payment Option, offer more        
favorable rates in lieu of the guaranteed rates specified in the Annuity Tables 
found in the Contract.                                                          

The value of Variable Annuity Payments will reflect the investment experience   
of the chosen Portfolio. Only one Variable Annuity Option may be chosen from    
among those made available by the Company for each Portfolio. The Annuity       
Tables, which are contained in the Contract and are used to calculate the value 
of the initial Variable Annuity Payment, are based on an assumed interest rate  
of 4%. If the actual net investment experience exactly equals the assumed       
interest rate, then the Variable Annuity Payments will remain the same (equal   
to the first Annuity Payment). However, if actual investment experience exceeds 
the assumed interest rate, the Variable Annuity Payments will increase;         
conversely, they will decrease if the actual experience is lower. The method of 
computation of Variable Annuity Payments is described in more detail in the     
Statement of Additional Information.                                            

The value of all payments, both fixed and variable, will be greater for shorter 
guaranteed periods than for longer guaranteed periods, and greater for life     
annuities than for joint and survivor annuities, because they are expected to   
be made for a shorter period.                                                   

After the Annuity Date, you may change the Portfolio funding the Variable       
Annuity Payments on the appropriate Company form or by calling our              
Administrative Offices at 1-800-866-6007.                                       

DEFERMENT OF PAYMENT 

Payment of any cash withdrawal or lump sum Death Benefit due from the Separate  
Account will occur within seven days from the date the election becomes         
effective except that the Company may be permitted to defer such payment if:    
(1) the New York Stock Exchange is closed for other than usual weekends or      
holidays, or trading on the New York Stock Exchange is otherwise restricted; or 
(2) an emergency exists as defined by the SEC, or the SEC requires that trading 
be restricted; or (3) the SEC permits a delay for the protection of Contract    
Owners.

As to amounts allocated to the General Account, we may, at any time, defer      
payment of the Surrender Value for up to six months after we receive a request  
for it. We will allow interest of at least 4% annually on any Surrender Value   
payment derived from the General Account that we defer 30 days or more.         

FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS
INTRODUCTION                                                                    

The ultimate effect of federal income taxes on the amounts paid for the         
Contract, on the investment return on assets held under a Contract, on Annuity  
Payments, and on the economic benefits to the Contract Owner, Annuitant or      
Annuitant's Beneficiary, depends on the terms of the Contract, the Company's    
tax status and upon the tax status of the individuals concerned. The following  
discussion is general in nature and is not intended as tax advice. You should   
consult a tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of purchasing a Contract.  
No attempt is made to consider any applicable state or other tax laws.          
Moreover, the discussion is based upon the Company's understanding of the       
federal income tax laws as they are currently interpreted. No representation is 
made regarding the likelihood of continuation of the federal income tax laws,   
the Treasury regulations or the current interpretations by the Internal Revenue 
Service. We reserve the right to make uniform changes in the Contract to the    
extent necessary to continue to qualify the Contract as an annuity. For a       
discussion of federal income taxes as they relate to the Funds, please see the  
accompanying Prospectuses for the Funds.                                        

TAXATION OF ANNUITIES IN GENERAL 

Section 72 of the Code governs taxation of annuities. In general, a Contract    
Owner is not taxed on increases in value under a Contract until some form of    
withdrawal or distribution is made under it. However, under certain             
circumstances, the increase in value may be subject to current federal income   
tax. (See "Contracts Owned by Non-Natural Persons," page 29, and                
"Diversification Standards," page 29.)                                          

Section 72 provides that the proceeds of a full or partial withdrawal from a    
Contract prior to the Annuity Date will be treated as taxable income to the     
extent the amounts held under the Contract exceed the "investment in the        
Contract," as that term is defined in the Code. The "investment in the          
Contract" can generally be described as the cost of the Contract, and generally 
constitutes all Purchase Payments paid for the Contract less any amounts        
received under the Contract that are excluded from the individual's gross       
income. The taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates. For purposes 
of this rule, a pledge or assignment of a Contract is treated as a payment      
received on account of a partial withdrawal of a Contract.                      

Upon receipt of a full or partial withdrawal or an Annuity Payment under the    
Contract, you will be taxed if the value of the Contract exceeds the investment 
in the Contract. Ordinarily, the taxable portion of such payments will be taxed 
at ordinary income tax rates.                                                   

For Fixed Annuity Payments, in general, the taxable portion of each payment is  
determined by using a formula known as the "exclusion ratio," which establishes 
the ratio that the investment in the Contract bears to the total expected       
amount of Annuity Payments for the term of the Contract. That ratio is then     
applied to each payment to determine the non-taxable portion of the payment.    
The remaining portion of each payment is taxed at ordinary income tax rates.    
For Variable Annuity Payments, in general, the taxable portion is determined by 
a formula that establishes a specific dollar amount of each payment that is not 
taxed. The dollar amount is determined by dividing the investment in the        
Contract by the total number of expected periodic payments. The remaining       
portion of each payment is taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Once the         
excludible portion of Annuity Payments to date equals the investment in the     
Contract, the balance of the Annuity Payments will be fully taxable.            

Withholding of federal income taxes on all distributions may be required unless 
the recipient elects not to have any amounts withheld and properly notifies the 
Company of that election.                                                       

With respect to amounts withdrawn or distributed before the taxpayer reaches    
age 59 1/2, a penalty tax is imposed equal to 10% of the taxable portion of     
amounts withdrawn or distributed. However, the penalty tax will not apply to    
withdrawals (i) made on or after the death of the Contract Owner or, where the  
Contract Owner is not an individual, the death of the Annuitant, who is defined 
as the individual the events in whose life are of primary importance in         
affecting the timing and                                                        

27

P-->485APOS31st Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 31st
payment under the Contracts; (ii) attributable to the taxpayer's becoming       
disabled within the meaning of Code Section 72(m)(7); (iii) that are part of a  
series of substantially equal periodic payments made at least annually for the  
life (or life expectancy) of the taxpayer, or joint lives (or joint life        
expectancies) of the taxpayer and his or her beneficiary; (iv) from a qualified 
plan (note, however, other penalties may apply); (v) under a qualified funding  
asset (as defined in Code Section 130(d)); (vi) under an immediate annuity      
contract as defined in Section 72(u)(4); or (vii) that are purchased by an      
employer on termination of certain types of qualified plans and that are held   
by the employer until the employee separates from service. Other tax penalties  
may apply to certain distributions as well as to certain contributions and      
other transactions under Qualified Contracts.                                   

If the penalty tax does not apply to a withdrawal as a result of the            
application of item (iii) above, and the series of payments are subsequently    
modified (other than by reason of death or disability), the tax for the year in 
which the modification occurs will be increased by an amount (as determined     
under Treasury Regulations) equal to the tax that would have been imposed but   
for item (iii) above, plus interest for the deferral period. The foregoing rule 
applies if the modification takes place (a) before the close of the period that 
is five years from the date of the first payment and after the taxpayer attains 
age 59 1/2, or (b) before the taxpayer reaches age 59 1/2.                      

THE COMPANY'S TAX STATUS                                                        
The Company is taxed as a life insurance company under Part I of Subchapter L   
of the Code. Since the Separate Account is not a separate entity from the       
Company and its operations form a part of the Company, it will not be taxed     
separately as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Code.  

Investment income and realized capital gains on the assets of the Separate      
Account are reinvested and taken into account in determining the Accumulated    
Value. Under existing federal income tax law, the Separate Account's investment 
income, including realized net capital gains, is not taxed to the Company. The  
Company reserves the right to make a deduction for taxes should they be imposed 
with respect to such items in the future.                                       

DISTRIBUTION-AT-DEATH RULES                                                     

In order to be treated as an annuity contract, a Contract must generally        
provide the following two distribution rules: (a) if any Contract Owner dies on 
or after the Annuity Date and before the entire interest in the Contract has    
been distributed, the remaining portion of such interest must be distributed at 
least as quickly as the method in effect on the Contract Owner's death; and (b) 
if any Contract Owner dies before the Annuity Date, the entire interest must    
generally be distributed within five years after the date of death. To the      
extent such interest is payable to the Owner's Designated Beneficiary, however, 
such interests may be annuitized over the life of that Owner's Designated       
Beneficiary or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of that   
Owner's Designated Beneficiary, so long as distributions commence within one    
year after the Contract Owner's death. If the Owner's Designated Beneficiary is 
the spouse of the Contract Owner, the Contract (together with the deferral on   
tax on the accrued and future income thereunder) may be continued unchanged in  
the name of the spouse as Contract Owner. The term Owner's Designated           
Beneficiary means the natural person named by the Contract Owner as a           
beneficiary and to whom ownership of the Contract passes by reason of the       
Contract Owner's death (unless the Contract Owner was also the Annuitant--in    
which case the Annuitant's Beneficiary is entitled to the Death Benefit).       

If the Contract Owner is not an individual, the "primary Annuitant" (as defined 
under the Code) is considered the Contract Owner. The primary Annuitant is the  
individual who is of primary importance in affecting the timing or the amount   
of payout under a Contract. In addition, when the Contract Owner is not an      
individual, a change in the primary Annuitant is treated as the death of the    
Contract Owner. Finally, in the case of joint Contract Owners, the distribution 
will be required at the death of the first of the Contract Owners.              

TRANSFERS OF ANNUITY CONTRACTS 

Any transfer of a Non-Qualified Contract prior to the Annuity Date for less     
than full and adequate consideration will generally trigger tax on the gain in  
the Contract to the Contract Owner at the time of such transfer. The investment 
in the Contract of the transferee will be increased by any amount included in   
the Contract Owner's income. This provision, however, does not apply to those   
transfers between spouses or incident to a divorce which are governed by Code   
Section 1041(a).

CONTRACTS OWNED BY NON-NATURAL PERSONS 

Where the Contract is held by a non-natural person (for example, a              
corporation), the Contract is generally not treated as an annuity contract for  
federal income tax purposes, and the income on that Contract (generally the     
increase in the net Accumulated Value less the payments) is includible in       
taxable income each year. The rule does not apply where the non-natural person  
is only a nominal owner such as a trust or other entity acting as an agent for  
a natural person. If an employer is the nominal owner of a Contract, and the    
beneficial owners are employees, then the Contract is not treated as being held 
by a non-natural person. The rule also does not apply where the Contract is     
acquired by the estate of a decedent, where the Contract is a qualified funding 
asset for structured settlements, where the Contract is purchased on behalf of  
an employee upon termination of a qualified plan, and in the case of an         
immediate annuity.                                                              

ASSIGNMENTS 

A transfer of ownership of a Contract, a collateral assignment or the           
designation of an Annuitant or other beneficiary who is not also the Contract   
Owner may result in tax consequences to the Contract Owner, Annuitant or        
beneficiary that are not discussed herein. A Contract Owner contemplating such  
a transfer or assignment of a Contract should contact a tax advisor with        
respect to the potential tax effects of such a transaction.                     

MULTIPLE CONTRACTS RULE                                                         

All non-qualified annuity contracts issued by the same company (or affiliate)   
to the same Contract Owner during any calendar year are to be aggregated and    
treated as one contract for purposes of determining the amount includible in    
the taxpayer's gross income. Thus, any amount received under any Contract prior 
to the Contract's Annuity Date, such as a partial withdrawal, will be taxable   
(and possibly subject to the 10% federal penalty tax) to the extent of the      
combined income in all such contracts. The Treasury Department has specific     
authority to issue regulations that prevent the avoidance of Code Section 72(e) 
through the serial purchase of annuity contracts or otherwise. In addition,     
there may be other situations in which the Treasury Department may conclude     
that it would be appropriate to aggregate two or more Contracts purchased by    
the same Contract Owner. Accordingly, a Contract Owner should consult a tax     
advisor before purchasing more than one Contract or other annuity contracts.    

DIVERSIFICATION STANDARDS 

To comply with certain diversification regulations (the "Regulations") under    
Code Section 817(h), after a start up period, the Separate Account will be      
required to diversify its investments. The Regulations generally require that   
on the last day of each quarter of a calendar year, no more than 55% of the     
value of the Separate Account is represented by any one investment, no more     
than 70% is represented by any two investments, no more than 80% is represented 
by any three investments, and no more than 90% is represented by any four       
investments. A "look-through" rule applies that suggests that each Subaccount   
of the Separate Account will be tested for compliance with the percentage       
limitations by looking through to the assets of the Portfolios in which each    
such Subaccount invests. All securities of the same issuer are treated as a     
single investment. Each government agency or instrumentality will be treated as 
a separate issuer for purposes of those limitations.                            

In connection with the issuance of temporary diversification regulations in     
1986, the Treasury Department announced that such regulations did not provide   
guidance concerning the extent to which Contract Owners may direct their        
investments to particular divisions of a separate account. It is possible that  
regulations or revenue rulings may be issued in this area at some time in the   
future. It is not clear, at this time, what these regulations or rulings would  
provide. It is possible that when the regulations or ruling are issued, the     
Contracts may need to be modified in order to remain in compliance. For these   
reasons, the Company reserves the right to modify the Contracts, as necessary,  
to prevent the Contract Owner from being considered the owner of assets of the  
Separate Account.                                                               

We intend to comply with the Regulations to assure that the Contracts continue  
to be treated as annuity contracts for federal income tax purposes.             

403(B) CONTRACTS 
Contracts will be offered in connection with retirement plans adopted by public 
school systems and certain tax-exempt organizations (Code Section 501(c)(3)     
organizations) for their employees under Section 403(b) of the Code; except, as 

29

P-->485APOS33rd Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 33rd
discussed below and subject to any conditions in an employer's plan, a Contract 
used in connection with a Section 403(b) Plan offers the same benefits and is   
subject to the same charges described in this Prospectus.                       

The Code imposes a maximum limit on annual Purchase Payments which may be       
excluded from your gross income. Such limit must be calculated in accordance    
with Sections 403(b), 415 and 402(g) of the Code. In addition, Purchase         
Payments will be excluded from your gross income only if the 403(b) Plan meets  
certain Code non-discrimination requirements.                                   

Under your 403(b) Contract, you may borrow against your Contract's Surrender    
Value after the first Contract Year. No additional loans will be extended until 
prior loan balances are paid in full. The loan amount must be at least $1,000   
with a minimum vested Accumulated Value of $2,000. The loan amount may not      
exceed the lesser of (a) or (b), where (a) is 50% of the Contract's vested      
Accumulated Value on the date on which the loan is made, and (b) is $50,000     
reduced by the highest outstanding balance of any loan within the preceding 12  
months ending on the day before the current loan is made. If you are married,   
your spouse must consent in writing to a loan request. This consent must be     
given within the 90-day period before the loan is to be made.                   

On the first Business Day of each calendar month, the Company will determine a  
loan interest rate. The loan interest rate for the calendar month in which the  
loan is effective will apply for one year from the loan effective date.         
Annually on the anniversary of the loan effective date, the rate will be        
adjusted to equal the loan interest rate determined for the month in which the  
loan anniversary occurs.                                                        

Principal and Interest on loans must be amortized in quarterly installments     
over a five year term except for certain loans for the purchase of a principal  
residence. If the loan interest rate is adjusted, future payments will be       
adjusted so that the outstanding loan balance is amortized in equal quarterly   
installments over the remaining term. A $40 processing fee is charged for each  
loan. The remainder of each repayment will be credited to the individual        
account.                                                                        

If a loan payment is not made when due, interest will continue to accrue. The   
defaulted payment plus accrued interest will be deducted from any future        
distributions under the Contract and paid to us. Any loan payment which is not  
made when due, plus interest, will be treated as a distribution, as permitted   
by law. The loan payment may be taxable to the borrower, and may be subject to  
the early withdrawal tax penalty. When a loan is made, the number of            
Accumulation Units equal to the loan amount will be withdrawn from the          
individual account and placed in the Collateral Fixed Account. Accumulation     
Units taken from the individual account to provide a loan do not participate in 
the investment experience of the related Portfolios or the guarantees of the    
General Account Guaranteed Options. The loan amount will be withdrawn on a pro  
rata basis first from the Portfolios to which Accumulated Value has been        
allocated, and if that amount is insufficient, collateral will then be          
transferred from the General Account Guaranteed Options--except the Five-Year   
Guaranteed Equity Option. As with any withdrawal, Market Value Adjustments or   
other deductions applicable to amounts allocated to General Account Guaranteed  
Options may be applied and no amounts may be withdrawn from the Five-Year       
Guaranteed Equity Option. Until the loan is repaid in full, that portion of the 
Collateral Fixed Account shall be credited with interest at a rate of 2% less   
than the loan interest rate applicable to the loan--however, the interest rate  
credited will never be less than the General Account Guaranteed Option's        
guaranteed rate of 3%.                                                          

A bill in the amount of the quarterly principal and interest will be mailed     
directly to you in advance of the payment due date. The initial quarterly       
repayment will be due three months from the loan date. The loan date will be    
the date that the Company receives the loan request form in good order. Payment 
is due within 30 calendar days after the due date. Subsequent quarterly         
installments are based on the first due date.                                   

When repayment of principal is made, Accumulation Units will be reallocated on  
a current value basis among the same investment Portfolios and/or General       
Account Guaranteed Options and in the same proportion as when the loan was      
initially made. If a repayment in excess of a billed amount is received, the    
excess will be applied towards the principal portion of the outstanding loan.   
Payments received which are less than the billed amount will not be accepted    
and will be returned to you.                                                    

If a partial surrender is taken from your individual account due to nonpayment  
of a billed quarterly installment, the date of the surrender will be the first  
Business Day following the 30 calendar day period in which the repayment was    
due.                                                                            

Prepayment of the entire loan is allowed. At the time of prepayment, the        
Company will bill you for any accrued interest, The Company will consider the   
loan paid when the loan balance and accrued interest are paid.                  

30

P-->485APOS34th Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 34th
If the individual account is surrendered with an outstanding loan balance, the  
outstanding loan balance and accrued interest will be deducted from the         
Surrender Value. If the individual account is surrendered, with an outstanding  
loan balance, due to the Contract Owner's death or the election of an Annuity   
Payment Option, the outstanding loan balance and accrued interest will be       
deducted.                                                                       

The Company may require that any outstanding loan be paid if the individual     
account value falls below an amount equal to 25% of total loans outstanding.    

The Code requires the aggregation of all loans made to an individual employee   
under a single employer-sponsored 403(b) Plan. However, since the Company has   
no information concerning the outstanding loans that you may have with other    
companies, if will only use the information available under Contracts issued by 
the Company.                                                                    

The Code imposed restrictions on full or partial surrenders from 403(b)         
individual accounts attributable to Purchase Payments under a salary reduction  
agreement and to any earnings on the entire 403(b) individual account credited  
on and after January 1, 1989. Surrenders of these amounts are allowed only if   
the Contract Owner (a) has died, (b) has become disabled, as defined in the     
Code, (c) has attained age 59 1/2, or (d) has separated from service.           
Surrenders are also allowed if the Contract Owner can show "hardship," as       
defined by the Internal Revenue Service, but the surrender is limited to the    
lesser of Purchase Payments made on or after January 1, 1989 or the amount      
necessary to relieve the hardship. Even if a surrender is permitted under these 
provisions, a 10% federal tax penalty may be assessed on the withdrawn amount   
if it does not otherwise meet the exceptions to the penalty tax provisions.     
(See "Taxation of Annuities in General," page   ).                              

Under the Code, you may request a full or partial surrender of an amount equal  
to the individual account cash value as of December 31, 1988 (the               
"grandfathered" amount), subject to the terms of the 403(b) Plan. Although the  
Code surrender restrictions do not apply to this amount, a 10% federal penalty  
tax may be assessed on the withdrawn amount if it does not otherwise meet the   
exceptions to the penalty tax provisions (See "Taxation of Annuities in
General," page   ).                                                             

The Company believes that the Code surrender restrictions do not apply to tax-  
free transfers pursuant to Revenue Ruling 90-24. The Company further believes   
that the surrender restrictions will not apply to any "grandfathered" amount    
transferred pursuant to Revenue Ruling 90-24 into another 403(b) Contract.      

GENERAL INFORMATION 
ADDITIONS, DELETIONS, OR SUBSTITUTIONS OF INVESTMENTS                           
The Company retains the right, subject to any applicable law, to make certain   
changes. The Company reserves the right to eliminate the shares of any of the   
Portfolios and to substitute shares of another Portfolio of the Funds, or of    
another registered, open-end management investment company, if the shares of    
the Portfolios are no longer available for investment, or, if in the Company's  
judgment, investment in any Portfolio would be inappropriate in view of the     
purposes of the Separate Account. To the extent required by the 1940 Act,       
substitutions of shares attributable to a Contract Owner's interest in a        
Portfolio will not be made until SEC approval has been obtained and the         
Contract Owner has been notified of the change.                                 

New Portfolios may be established at the discretion of the Company. Any new     
Portfolios will be made available to existing Contract Owners on a basis to be  
determined by the Company. The Company may also eliminate one or more           
Portfolios if marketing, tax, investment or other conditions so warrant.        

In the event of any such substitution or change, the Company may, by            
appropriate endorsement, make such changes in the Contracts as may be necessary 
or appropriate to reflect such substitution or change. Furthermore, if deemed   
to be in the best interests of persons having voting rights under the           
Contracts, the Separate Account may be operated as a management company under   
the 1940 Act or any other form permitted by law, may be deregistered under the  
1940 Act in the event such registration is no longer required, or may be        
combined with one or more other separate accounts.                              

VOTING RIGHTS                                                                   

The Funds do not hold regular meetings of shareholders. The Directors/Trustees  
of each Fund may call special meetings of shareholders as may be required by    
the 1940 Act or other applicable law. To the extent required by law,            

31

P-->485APOS35th Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 35th
the Portfolio shares held in the Separate Account will be voted by the Company  
at shareholder meetings of each Fund in accordance with instructions received   
from persons having voting interests in the corresponding Portfolio. Fund       
shares as to which no timely instructions are received or shares held by the    
Company as to which Contract Owners have no beneficial interest will be voted   
in proportion to the voting instructions that are received with respect to all  
Contracts participating in that Portfolio. Voting instructions to abstain on    
any item to be voted upon will be applied on a pro rata basis to reduce the     
votes eligible to be cast.                                                      

The number of votes that are available to a Contract Owner will be calculated   
separately for each Portfolio. That number will be determined by applying his   
or her percentage interest, if any, in a particular Portfolio to the total      
number of votes attributable to the Portfolio.                                  

Prior to the Annuity Date, a Contract Owner holds a voting interest in each     
Portfolio to which the Accumulated Value is allocated. The number of votes      
which are available to a Contract Owner will be determined by dividing the      
Accumulated Value attributable to a Portfolio by the net asset value per share  
of the applicable Portfolio. After the Annuity Date, the person receiving       
Annuity Payments has the voting interest. The number of votes after the Annuity 
Date will be determined by dividing the reserve for such Contract allocated to  
the Portfolio by the net asset value per share of the corresponding Portfolio.  
After the Annuity Date, the votes attributable to a Contract decrease as the    
reserves allocated to the Portfolio decrease. In determining the number of      
votes, fractional shares will be recognized.                                    

The number of votes of the Portfolio that are available will be determined as   
of the date coincident with the date established by that Portfolio for          
determining shareholders eligible to vote at the meeting of the corresponding   
Fund. Voting instructions will be solicited by written communication prior to   
such meeting in accordance with procedures established by such Fund.            

AUDITORS                                                                        

Ernst & Young LLP serves as independent auditors for the Separate Account and   
the Company and will audit their financial statements annually.                 

LEGAL MATTERS                                                                   

Jorden Burt & Berenson of Washington, D.C. has provided legal advice relating   
to the federal securities laws applicable to the issue and sale of the          
Contracts. All matters of Missouri law pertaining to the validity of the        
Contract and the Company's right to issue such Contracts have been passed upon  
by Robert L. Maddox, Esquire, on behalf of the Company.

THE CONTRACT 

In order to supplement the description in the Prospectus, the following         
provides additional information about the Contract which may be of interest to  
Contract Owners.                                                                

COMPUTATION OF VARIABLE ANNUITY INCOME PAYMENTS 

The amounts shown in the Annuity Tables contained in your Contract represent    
the guaranteed minimum for each Annuity Payment under a Fixed Payment Option.   
Variable annuity income payments are computed as follows. First, the            
Accumulated Value (or the portion of the Accumulated Value used to provide      
variable payments) is applied under the Annuity Tables contained in your        
Contract corresponding to the Annuity Payment Option elected by the Contract    
Owner and based on an assumed interest rate of 4%. This will produce a dollar   
amount which is the first monthly payment. The Company may, at the time annuity 
income payments are computed, offer more favorable rates in lieu of the         
guaranteed rates specified in the Annuity Tables.                               

The amount of each Annuity Payment after the first is determined by means of    
Annuity Units. The number of Annuity Units is determined by dividing the first  
Annuity Payment by the Annuity Unit Value for the selected Subaccount ten       
Business Days prior to the Annuity Date. The number of Annuity Units for the    
Subaccount then remains fixed, unless an Exchange of Annuity Units (as set      
forth below) is made. After the first Annuity Payment, the dollar amount of     
each subsequent Annuity Payment is equal to the number of Annuity Units         
multiplied by the Annuity Unit Value for the Subaccount ten Business Days       
before the due date of the Annuity Payment.                                     

The Annuity Unit Value for each Subaccount was initially established at $10.00  
on the date money was first deposited in that Subaccount. The Annuity Unit      
Value for any subsequent Business Day is equal to (a) times (b) times (c),      
where                                                                           

(a) =the Annuity Unit Value for the immediately preceding Business Day;     

(b) =the Net Investment Factor for the day;                                 

(c)=the investment result adjustment factor (.99989255 per day), which      
recognizes an assumed interest rate of 4% per year used in      
determining the Annuity Payment amounts.                        

The Net Investment Factor is a factor applied to a Subaccount that reflects     
daily changes in the value of the Subaccount due to:                            

(a)=any increase or decrease in the value of the Subaccount due to          
investment results;                                             

(b)=a daily charge assessed at an annual rate of .50% for the mortality and 
expense risks assumed by the Company;                           

(c)=a daily charge for the cost of administering the Contract corresponding 
    to an annual charge of .15% of the value of the Subaccount, plus the
Annual Contract Fee.                                            

The Annuity Tables contained in the Contract are based on the 1983 Table "A"    
Mortality Table projected for mortality improvement to the year 2000 using      
Projection Scale G and an interest rate of 4% a year; except that in            
Massachusetts and Montana, the Annuity Tables contained in the Contract are     
based on a 60% female/40% male blending of the above for all annuitants of      
either gender.                                                                  

EXCHANGES 

After the Annuity Date you may, by making a written request, exchange the       
current value of an existing Subaccount to Annuity Units of any other           
Subaccount(s) then available. The written request for an Exchange must be       
received by us, however, at least 10 Business Days prior to the first payment   
date on which the Exchange is to take effect. This Exchange shall result in the 
same dollar amount as that of the Annuity Payment on the date of Exchange (the  
"Exchange Date"). Each year you may make an unlimited number of free Exchanges  
between Subaccounts. A $15 fee is currently imposed for Exchanges in excess of  
twelve per Contract Year.                                                       

Exchanges will be made using the Annuity Unit Value for the Subaccounts on the  
date the written request for Exchange is received. On the Exchange Date, the    
Company will establish a value for the current Subaccounts by multiplying the   

2 

P-->485APOS39th Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 39th
Annuity Unit Value by the number of Annuity Units in the existing Subaccounts   
and compute the number of Annuity Units for the new Subaccounts by dividing the 
Annuity Unit Value of the new Subaccounts into the value previously calculated  
for the existing Subaccounts.                                                   

EXCEPTIONS TO CHARGES 

In addition to the Purchase Payment breakpoints discussed in the Prospectus,    
the Company may impose reduced sales loads, administrative charges or other     
deductions from Purchase Payments in certain situations where the Company       
expects to realize significant economies of scale or other economic benefits    
with respect to the sale of Contracts. This is possible because sales costs do  
not increase in proportion to the dollar amount of the Contracts sold. For      
example, the per-dollar transaction cost for a sale of a Contract equal to      
$5,000 is generally much higher than the per-dollar cost for a sale of a        
Contract equal to $1,000,000. As a result, the applicable sales charge declines 
as a percentage of the dollar amount of Contracts sold as the dollar amount     
increases.                                                                      

The Company may also impose reduced sales loads and reduced administrative      
charges and fees on sales to directors, officers and bona fide full-time        
employees (and their spouses and minor children) of the Company, its ultimate   
parent company, Providian Corporation, and their affiliates and certain sales   
representatives for the Contract.                                               

Notwithstanding the above, any variations in the sales loads, administrative    
charges or other deductions from Purchase Payments shall reflect differences in 
costs or services and shall not be unfairly discriminatory against any person.  

GENERAL MATTERS 

NON-PARTICIPATING 

The Contracts are non-participating. No dividends are payable and the Contracts 
will not share in the profits or surplus earnings of the Company.               

MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX 
The Company may require proof of age and sex before making Annuity Payments. If 
the Annuitant's stated age, sex or both in the Contract are incorrect, the      
Company will change the annuity benefits payable to those benefits which the    
Purchase Payments would have purchased for the correct age and sex. In the case 
of correction of the stated age and/or sex after payments have commenced, the   
Company will (1) in the case of underpayment, pay the full amount due with the  
next payment; (2) in the case of overpayment, deduct the amount due from one or 
more future payments.                                                           

ASSIGNMENT 

Any Non-Qualified Contract may be assigned by you prior to the Annuity Date and 
during the Annuitant's lifetime. The Company is not responsible for the         
validity of any assignment. No assignment will be recognized until the Company  
receives the appropriate Company form notifying the Company of such assignment. 
The interest of any beneficiary which the assignor has the right to change      
shall be subordinate to the interest of an assignee. Any amount paid to the     
assignee shall be paid in one sum notwithstanding any settlement agreement in   
effect at the time assignment was executed. The Company shall not be liable as  
to any payment or other settlement made by the Company before receipt of the    
appropriate Company form.                                                       

ANNUITY DATA 
The Company will not be liable for obligations which depend on receiving        
information from a Payee until such information is received in a form           
satisfactory to the Company.                                                    

ANNUAL STATEMENT 

Once each Contract Year, the Company will send you an annual statement of the   
current Accumulated Value allocated to each Subaccount and/or the General       
Account Guaranteed Options; and any Purchase Payments, charges,

P-->485APOS40th Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 40th
Exchanges or withdrawals during the year. This report will also give you any    
other information required by law or regulation. You may ask for an annual      
statement like this at any time. We will also send you quarterly statements.    
However, we reserve the right to discontinue quarterly statements at any time.  

INCONTESTABILITY 

This Contract is incontestable from the Contract Date, subject to the           
"Misstatement of Age or Sex" provision.                                         

OWNERSHIP 

The Contract Owner on the Contract Date is the Annuitant, unless otherwise      
specified in the application. The Contract Owner may specify a new Contract     
Owner by sending us the appropriate Company form at any time thereafter. The    
term Contract Owner also includes any person named as a Joint Owner. A Joint    
Owner shares ownership in all respects with the Contract Owner. During the      
Annuitant's lifetime, all rights and privileges under this Contract may be      
exercised solely by the Contract Owner. Upon the death of the Contract Owner,   
ownership is retained by the surviving Joint Owner or passes to the Owner's     
Designated Beneficiary, if one has been designated by the Contract Owner. If no 
Owner's Designated Beneficiary has been selected or if no Owner's Designated    
Beneficiary is living, then the Owner's Designated Beneficiary is the Contract  
Owner's estate. From time to time the Company may require proof that the        
Contract Owner is still living.                                                 

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION 

Performance information for the Subaccounts including the yield and effective   
yield of the Prime Money and Money Market Subaccounts, the yield of the         
remaining Subaccounts, and the total return of all Subaccounts, may appear in   
reports or promotional literature to current or prospective Contract Owners.    

PRIME MONEY AND MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO SUBACCOUNT YIELDS 

Current yield for the Prime Money and Money Market Subaccounts will be based on 
the change in the value of a hypothetical investment (exclusive of capital      
changes) over a particular 7-day period, less a pro-rata share of Subaccount    
expenses accrued over that period (the "base period"), and stated as a          
percentage of the investment at the start of the base period (the "base period  
return"). The base period return is then annualized by multiplying by 365/7,    
with the resulting yield figure carried to at least the nearest hundredth of    
one percent. Calculation of "effective yield" begins with the same "base period 
return" used in the calculation of yield, which is then annualized to reflect   
weekly compounding pursuant to the following formula:                           

Effective Yield = [(Base Period Return)+1)/3//6//5///7/] - 1

30-DAY YIELD FOR NON-MONEY MARKET SUBACCOUNTS 

Quotations of yield for the remaining Subaccounts will be based on all          
investment income per Unit earned during a particular 30-day period, less       
expenses accrued during the period ("net investment income"), and will be       
computed by dividing net investment income by the value of a Unit on the last   
day of the period, according to the following formula:                          

YIELD = 2[(a - b + 1)/6/ - 1] 
     -------------
     c - d

Where:                                                                          
[a] equals the net investment income earned during the period by the      
Portfolio attributable to shares owned by a Subaccount            

[b] equals the expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursement)     

[c] equals the average daily number of Units outstanding during the period

[d] equals the maximum offering price per Accumulation Unit on the last   
day of the period                                                 

4 

P-->485APOS41st Page of 60TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 41st
Yield on the Subaccount is earned from the increase in net asset value of       
shares of the Portfolio in which the Subaccount invests and from dividends      
declared and paid by the Portfolio, which are automatically reinvested in       
shares of the Portfolio.                                                        

STANDARDIZED AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN FOR NON-MONEY MARKET SUBACCOUNTS 

When advertising performance of the Subaccounts, the Company will show the      
"Standardized Average Annual Total Return," calculated as prescribed by the     
rules of the SEC, for each Subaccount. The Standardized Average Annual Total    
Return is the effective annual compounded rate of return that would have        
produced the cash redemption value over the stated period had the performance   
remained constant throughout. The calculation assumes a single $1,000 payment   
made at the beginning of the period and full redemption at the end of the       
period. It reflects the deduction of all applicable sales loads (including the  
contingent deferred sales load), the Annual Contract Fee and all other          
Portfolio, Separate Account and Contract level charges except Premium Taxes,    
if any.                                                                         

Quotations of average annual total return for any Subaccount will be expressed  
in terms of the average annual compounded rate of return of a hypothetical      
investment in a Contract over a period of one, five and ten years (or, if       
less, up to the life of the Subaccount), calculated pursuant to the formula:    

P(1 + T)n = ERV 

Where:                                                                          
(1) [P] equals a hypothetical initial Purchase Payment of $1,000          

(2) [T] equals an average annual total return                             

(3) [n] equals the number of years                                        

(4) [ERV] equals the ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000     
 Purchase Payment made at the beginning of the period (or fractional
portion thereof)                                                  

ADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES 

NON-STANDARDIZED ACTUAL TOTAL RETURN AND NON-STANDARDIZED ACTUAL AVERAGE 
ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN 
The Company may show Non-Standardized Actual Total Return (i.e., the            
percentage change in the value of an Accumulation Unit) for one or more         
Subaccounts with respect to one or more periods. The Company may also show      
Non-Standardized Actual Average Annual Total Return (i.e., the average annual   
change in Accumulation Unit Value) with respect to one or more periods. For     
one year, the Non-Standardized Actual Total Return and the Non-Standardized     
Actual Average Annual Total Return are effective annual rates of return and     
are equal. For periods greater than one year, the Non-Standardized Actual       
Average Annual Total Return is the effective annual compounded rate of return   
for the periods stated. Because the value of an Accumulation Unit reflects the  
Separate Account and Portfolio expenses (See Fee Table in the Prospectus), the  
Non-Standardized Actual Total Return and Non-Standardized Actual Average        
Annual Total Return also reflect these expenses. However, these percentages do  
not reflect the Annual Contract Fee, any sales loads or Premium Taxes (if       
any), which if included would reduce the percentages reported by the Company.   

NON-STANDARDIZED HYPOTHETICAL TOTAL RETURN AND NON-STANDARDIZED HYPOTHETICAL 
AVERAGE ANNUAL TOTAL RETURN 
The Company may show Non-Standardized Hypothetical Total Return and Non-        
Standardized Hypothetical Average Annual Total Return, calculated on the basis  
of the historical performance of the Portfolios (calculated beginning from the  
end of the year of inception for each Portfolio) and may assume the Contract    
was in existence prior to it's inception date. After the Contract's inception   
date, the calculations will reflect actual Accumulation Unit Values. These      
returns are based on specified premium patterns which produce the resulting     
Accumulated Values. However, they reflect a deduction for the Separate Account  
expenses and Portfolio expenses. They do not include the Annual Contract Fee,   
any sales loads or Premium Taxes (if any), which if included would reduce the   
percentages reported.

The Non-Standardized Annual Total Return for a Subaccount is the effective      
annual rate of return that would have produced the ending Accumulated Value of  
the stated one-year period.                                                     

The Non-Standardized Average Annual Total Return for a Subaccount is the        
effective annual compounded rate of return that would have produced the ending  
Accumulated Value over the stated period had the performance remained constant  
throughout.                                                                     

INDIVIDUALIZED COMPUTER GENERATED ILLUSTRATIONS 
The Company may from time to time use computer-based software available through 
Morningstar, CDA/Wiesenberger and/or other firms to provide registered          
representatives and existing and/or potential owners of Contracts with          
individualized hypothetical performance illustrations for some or all of the    
Portfolios. Such illustrations may include, without limitation, graphs, bar     
charts and other types of formats presenting the following information: (i) the 
historical results of a hypothetical investment in a single Portfolio; (ii) the 
historical fluctuation of the value of a single Portfolio (actual and           
hypothetical); (iii) the historical results of a hypothetical investment in     
more than one Portfolio; (iv) the historical performance of two or more market  
indices in relation to one another and/or one or more Portfolios; (v) the       
historical performance of two or more market indices in comparison to a single  
Portfolio or a group of Portfolios; (vi) a market risk/reward scatter chart     
showing the historical risk/reward relationship of one or more mutual funds or  
Portfolios to one or more indices and a broad category of similar anonymous     
variable annuity subaccounts; and (vii) Portfolio data sheets showing various   
information about one or more Portfolios (such as information concerning total  
return for various periods, fees and expenses, standard deviation, alpha and    
beta, investment objective, inception date and net assets).                     

PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS 

Performance information for any Subaccount reflects only the performance of a   
hypothetical Contract under which Accumulation Value is allocated to a          
Subaccount during a particular time period on which the calculations are based. 
Performance information should be considered in light of the investment         
objectives and policies, characteristics and quality of the Portfolio in which  
the Subaccount invests, and the market conditions during the given period, and  
should not be considered as a representation of what may be achieved in the     
future.                                                                         

Reports and marketing materials may, from time to time, include information     
concerning the rating of Providian Life and Health Insurance Company as         
determined by one or more of the ratings services listed below, or other        
recognized rating services. Reports and promotional literature may also contain 
other information including (i) the ranking of any Subaccount derived from      
rankings of variable annuity separate accounts or other investment products     
tracked by Lipper Analytical Services or by other rating services, companies,   
publications, or other person who rank separate accounts or other investment    
products on overall performance or other criteria, and (ii) the effect of tax-  
deferred compounding on a Subaccount's investment returns, or returns in        
general, which may be illustrated by graphs, charts, or otherwise, and which    
may include a comparison, at various points in time, of the return from an      
investment in a Contract (or returns in general) on a tax-deferred basis        
(assuming one or more tax rates) with the return on a taxable basis.            

Each Subaccount's performance depends on, among other things, the performance   
of the underlying Portfolio which, in turn, depends upon such variables as:     

. quality of underlying investments;                                        

. average maturity of underlying investments;                               

. type of instruments in which the Portfolio is invested;                   

. changes in interest rates and market value of underlying investments;     

. changes in Portfolio expenses; and                                        

. the relative amount of the Portfolio's cash flow.                         

From time to time, we may advertise the performance of the Subaccounts and the  
underlying Portfolios as compared to similar funds or portfolios using certain  
indexes, reporting services and financial publications, and we may advertise

rankings or ratings issued by certain services and/or other institutions. These 
may include, but are not limited to, the following:                             

. DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE ("DJIA"), an unmanaged index representing    
share prices of major industrial corporations, public utilities, and    
transportation companies. Produced by the Dow Jones & Company, it is    
cited as a principal indicator of market conditions.                    

. STANDARD & POOR'S DAILY STOCK PRICE INDEX OF 500 COMMON STOCKS, a         
composite index of common stocks in industrial, transportation, and     
financial and public utility companies, which can be used to compare to 
the total returns of funds whose portfolios are invested primarily in   
common stocks. In addition, the Standard & Poor's index assumes         
reinvestments of all dividends paid by stocks listed on its index. Taxes
due on any of these distributions are not included, nor are brokerage or
other fees calculated into the Standard & Poor's figures.

Investors may use such indexes (or reporting services) in addition to the       
Funds' Prospectuses to obtain a more complete view of each Portfolio's          
performance before investing. Of course, when comparing each Portfolio's        
performance to any index, conditions such as composition of the index and       
prevailing market conditions should be considered in assessing the significance 
of such companies. Unmanaged indexes may assume the reinvestment of dividends   
but generally do not reflect deductions for administrative and management costs 
and expenses.

When comparing funds using reporting services, or total return and yield, or    
effective yield, investors should take into consideration any relevant          
differences in funds such as permitted portfolio compositions and methods used  
to value portfolio securities and compute offering price.

 
VA: 
o 
Separate account product 
o 
Guarantees increase liquidity risk 
o 
High allocation to illiquid assets 
(c) 
For each scenario: 
(i) 
Classify the scenario as a reputational or a market-wide liquidity crunch 
event. 
Commentary on Question: 
Many candidates misinterpreted this part of the question, which was 
supposed to be classifying two different types of liquidity crunch events. 
 
The first scenario is a reputational liquidity event since it impacts 
Zoolander only. 
 
The second scenario is a market-wide liquidity event since it impacts 
the entire market. 
(ii) 
Describe the risks to Zoolander’s ability to operate as a going concern and 
the consequences if those risks materialize. 
Commentary on Question: 
For the first scenario, many candidates did not address the consequences 
from the ratings perspective. 
Most candidates did better for the first 
scenario than the second scenario. 
 
Scenario I: 
o 
Lower new sales 
o 
Surrenders increase 
o 
Possible downgrade, which might trigger the put option on the 
GIC 
 
Scenario II: 
o 
Unable to liquidate any assets for normally occurring cash 
outflows 
o 
ROP or GICs may cause crisis due to not being able to sell any 
assets besides government bonds 
o 
Be forced to liquidate all its government securities 
(d) 
Evaluate the appropriateness of each action as a means of Zoolander improving its 
liquidity risk profile. 
Commentary on Question: 
Most candidates were able to identify the pros of each option, not the cons.

Continued 
 
Revise product design to increase surrender charges 
o 
Improves the liquidity risk profile through deterring surrenders 
o 
Might be less competitive in the market 
o 
Appropriate from the long-term perspective 
 
Reallocate the fixed income portfolio to hold more Treasury securities 
o 
Treasury securities are more liquid and have low risk 
o 
Might lower asset returns, thus lowering crediting rate (making GICs 
less competitive) 
o 
Appropriate since the current allocation percentage is low 
 
Establish a $2 million line of credit with a bank at a cost of $20,000 per 
annum 
o 
Would be able to alleviate some liquidity risk 
o 
There would be additional counterparty risk 
o 
Might not be enough in case of liquidity crisis 
o 
Appropriate for reputational liquidity crunch but not appropriate for 
market-wide liquidity crunch events
