Dr. audet specializes in the following:
Pain Management Specialist

Description
A pain management specialist uses a range of approaches to prevent, evaluate and treat pain disorders. Pain management specialists may be trained in a number of other specialties, including physical rehabilitation and anesthesiology, and may work alongside surgeons during childbirth and surgical procedures. Conditions treated by pain management specialists include pain from disease, such as cancer; post-operative pain; pain caused by an injury; or pain that is the condition itself, such as headaches. Treatment options may include medication, therapy and counseling. Pain management specialists may also be trained in nontraditional forms of pain management, such as acupuncture -- a form of Chinese medicine that involves inserting needles into certain body points to relieve pain and promote healing.

See what state and federal disciplinary actions (if any) have been reported against this doctor in the past five years.
Disciplinary Actions:
 Not Available

        Disciplinary actions are actions taken to punish or restrict physicians who have demonstrated professional misconduct. They are intended to correct the doctor's misconduct. Physicians with disciplinary actions may continue to practice, depending on the board's decision. Physicians who have had a disciplinary action in one state will often move to another state where he/she may have a clean record in that new state. Lifescript's Doctor Finder compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, you'll know if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.

About Pain Management Specialists


What is a pain management specialist? Pain management specialists are licensed medical professionals who use various approaches to prevent, evaluate and treat acute or chronic pain disorders. Pain management specialists may be trained in a number of specialties, including orthopedic surgery, neurology, physiatry (physical medicine and rehabilitation) and anesthesiology, or may work alongside surgeons.What is chronic pain? Unlike acute pain, which hurts and then subsides, chronic pain is constant and persists for weeks, months or years. Chronic pain may also increase over time, or increase and then decrease back to its baseline acute or chronic pain. There tends to be an initial trigger, such as disease or injury. Common chronic pain complaints include cancer pain, lower back pain, joint pain, abdominal pain and headaches.Most chronic pain sufferers tend to be older. According to the American Academy of Pain Medicine, more than 76 million Americans suffer from it. Chronic pain often causes a financial and emotional burden for the patient due to costly medical bills and taking time off from work. Chronic pain costs the U.S. workforce $1.2 billion a year in lost productivity.When would I see a pain management specialist and what conditions does a pain specialist treat? You would see a pain management specialist to help manage chronic postoperative pain, as well as pain from disease (e.g., cancer), injury (e.g., compression fracture), or painful conditions (migraines, fibromyalgia, etc.). Other conditions that cause chronic pain include reflex sympathetic dystrophy (disease of the nervous system), peripheral nerve injury (causalgia), inflammation of the spinal nerves (arachnoiditis), chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and phantom limb pain.Some pain specialists take a multidisciplinary approach, per the guidelines issued by the American Pain Society and the North American Spine Society. These doctors will recommend not only pain medication but physical therapy and mental health professionals to help the patient with the emotional and mental effects of chronic pain.Treatment options may include oral or injected medications, nerve stimulation, physical therapy and counseling. Pain management specialists may also be trained in nontraditional forms of pain management, such as acupuncture. Certain medications for treating pain include narcotic painkillers and long-acting morphine, as well as anti-inflammatories and steroidal anti-inflammatories. Other medications include anti-epileptics such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica), or a class of antidepressants known as SNRIs (selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) that includes duloxetine (Cymbalta). Some doctors may incorporate integrated medicine, or practice rational poly-pharmacy, which is the use of a well- targeted combination of medications.Related Articles:13 Ways to Relieve Chronic Pain In Pain?

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
