The Laboratory of Dennis J. Selkoe, M.D.






Harvard Medical School
          Center for Neurologic Diseases
          Brigham & Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA












Dennis J. Selkoe, MD
        The Vincent and Stella Coates Professor of Neurologic Diseases
        Harvard Medical School
Co-Director,  Center for Neurologic Diseases
  Department  of Neurology
  Brigham and Women’s Hospital 
Dennis Selkoe, the Vincent and Stella Coates Professor of Neurologic Diseases at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has devoted his career to the use of molecular approaches to study Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease and related basic biological questions.  He is a graduate of Columbia University and the University of Virginia School of Medicine.  After initial research training at the National Institutes of Health (NINDS), he completed a residency in neurology at the Harvard/Longwood Program and a postdoctoral fellowship in neuronal cell biology and neurochemistry in the Department of Neuroscience, HMS.  In 1978, he founded a laboratory applying biochemical and cell biological techniques to the study of human neurodegeneration.   



Selkoe and coworkers broke new ground in 1982 when they developed a method to isolate the abnormal neurofibrillary tangles that are a hallmark of AD and described their unusual chemical properties.  With other labs, they identified the microtubule-associated protein tau as the principal component of tangles.  Selkoe then turned his attention to the other hallmark lesion of AD -- the amyloid plaque -- and has conducted extensive experiments on the amyloid ß-protein (Aß) and its precursor, APP.  The results led him to formulate a theory -- the amyloid (or Aß) hypothesis -- about the pathogenic cascade that causes AD.  In 1992, Selkoe and collaborators discovered that Aß is continuously produced by normal cells throughout life.  This unexpected finding initiated the dynamic study of Aß formation in cultured cells and has enabled the identification of Aß production inhibitors.  The lab showed that inherited mutations in APP, and later the presenilin genes, cause AD by increasing the generation of Aß.  In 1999, Selkoe and colleagues identified presenilin as the long-sought gamma-secretase, an unprecedented intramembrane aspartyl protease that processes APP, Notch and many other proteins.  Recently, the Selkoe lab conducted a series of studies showing that small, soluble oligomers of Aß are responsible for synaptic injury and interfere with memory.
These advances have led to numerous awards, including the Potamkin Prize (shared with George G. Glenner), the Metropolitan Life Foundation Award, and the A.H. Heineken Price for Medicine.  Selkoe is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  He co-founded and co-directs the Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital.  Selkoe was the principal founding scientist of Athena Neurosciences, now Elan Pharmaceuticals.  He has served on the editorial boards of several scientific journals, the Neuroscience Review Committee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the National Advisory Council on Aging (NIH).  With HMS Dean Joseph P. Martin, he founded the Harvard Center for Neurodegeneration and Repair in 2001.

The Laboratory of Dennis J. Selkoe, M.D.






Harvard Medical School
          Center for Neurologic Diseases
          Brigham & Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA












Welcome to the  Selkoe Laboratory at Brigham and Women's hosptial  and Harvard Medical School. 

        Our laboratory is part of the Center for Neurologic Diseases: a group of multidisciplinary biomedical research laboratories which has its central objective in the application of a wide range of current biological methods to the elucidation of the pathogenesis and treatment of certain chronic, unsolved neurological diseases

        Our laboratory is interested in the biochemistry and molecular and cell biology of neuronal degeneration during aging of the mammalian brain, particularly in Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases. The laboratory originally developed methods for the purification and analysis of the intraneuronal paired helical filaments and extra cellular amyloid fibrils that are the hallmarks of the neuropathology of AD.      




 Extensive studies of the trafficking and processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein critically involved in AD, have been undertaken and continue. The laboratory discovered that Aß is constitutively produced from APP during normal cellular metabolism, enabling dynamic cell biologically studies of the mechanism of Aß production and it's pharmacological inhibition. The function of APP and the toxic properties of various Aß assemblies on cultured neurons and in relevant mouse models are being examined. The central role of presenilin in APP and Notch signaling and the mechanism by which presenilin mutations produce AD are also under study. Finally, a similar approach is being applied to the function and dysfunction of gene products implicated in PD, particularly a-synuclein and PINK-1. A wide range of methods is employed, including cell culture, protein biochemistry, recombinant DNA studies, immunohistochemistry, light and electron microscopy, and animal modeling.

Dennis Selkoe, MDVincent and Stella Coates Professor of Neurologic DiseasesHarvard Institutes of MedicineAnn Romney Center for Neurologic DiseasesHarvard Institutes of  Medicine Room 7304 Blackfan StreetBoston, MA  02115Tel: 617-525-5200Fax: 617-525-5252Email: dselkoe@partners.orgVisit my lab page here.Our laboratory is interested in the biochemistry and molecular and cell biology of neuronal degeneration during aging of the mammalian brain and particularly in Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s (PD) diseases. The laboratory originally developed methods for the purification and analysis of the intraneuronal paired helical filaments and extracellular amyloid fibrils that are the hallmarks of the neuropathology of AD.  Extensive studies of the trafficking and processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a membrane glycoprotein critically involved in AD, have been undertaken and continue. The lab discovered that Aβ is normally produced from APP throughout life, enabling dynamic cell biological studies of the mechanism of Aβ production and its pharmacological inhibition. The function of APP and the toxic properties of various Aβ assemblies on cultured neurons and in relevant mouse models are being examined. We discovered that presenilin is the active site of γ-secretase and study its role in APP and Notch proteolysis. Finally, a similar approach is bring applied to the function and dysfunction of gene products implicated in PD, particularly α-synuclein. We recently discovered that α-synuclein  exists normally as α-helically folded tetramers and that their destabilization may lead to PD.  We use a wide range of methods, including cell culture, protein biochemistry, molecular biology, immunohistochemistry, confocal and electron microscopy, electrophysiology and mouse modeling.

Abstract
With the advent of novel therapies for AD, there is a pressing need for biomarkers that are easy to monitor, such as the amyloid-beta levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma. To gain a better understanding of the explanatory power of these biomarkers, we formulate and analyze a compaxtmental mathematical model for the amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain, CSF and plasma throughout the course of Alzheimer's treatment. Our analysis reveals that the total amyloid-beta burden in the brain is dictated by a unitless quantity called the polymerization ratio, which is the product of the production and elongation rates divided by the product of the fragmentation and loss rates. In this ratio, the production rate and loss rate include a source and sink term, respectively, related to the intercompaxtmental transport. Our results suggest that production inhibitors are likely to reduce the amyloid-beta levels in all three compartments. In contrast, agents that ingest monomers off of polymers, or that increase fragmentation or block elongation, may also reduce amyloid-beta burden in the brain, but may produce little change in  or even transiently increase  CSF and plasma amyloid-beta levels. Hence, great care must be taken when interpreting these biomarkers.

Dennis Selkoe, MDVincent and Stella Coates Professor of Neurologic DiseasesHarvard Institutes of MedicineAnn Romney Center for Neurologic DiseasesHarvard Institutes of  Medicine Room 7304 Blackfan StreetBoston, MA  02115Tel: 617-525-5200Fax: 617-525-5252Email: dselkoe@partners.orgVisit my lab page here.Our laboratory is interested in the biochemistry and molecular and cell biology of neuronal degeneration during aging of the mammalian brain and particularly in Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s (PD) diseases. The laboratory originally developed methods for the purification and analysis of the intraneuronal paired helical filaments and extracellular amyloid fibrils that are the hallmarks of the neuropathology of AD.  Extensive studies of the trafficking and processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a membrane glycoprotein critically involved in AD, have been undertaken and continue. The lab discovered that Aβ is normally produced from APP throughout life, enabling dynamic cell biological studies of the mechanism of Aβ production and its pharmacological inhibition. The function of APP and the toxic properties of various Aβ assemblies on cultured neurons and in relevant mouse models are being examined. We discovered that presenilin is the active site of γ-secretase and study its role in APP and Notch proteolysis. Finally, a similar approach is bring applied to the function and dysfunction of gene products implicated in PD, particularly α-synuclein. We recently discovered that α-synuclein  exists normally as α-helically folded tetramers and that their destabilization may lead to PD.  We use a wide range of methods, including cell culture, protein biochemistry, molecular biology, immunohistochemistry, confocal and electron microscopy, electrophysiology and mouse modeling.
