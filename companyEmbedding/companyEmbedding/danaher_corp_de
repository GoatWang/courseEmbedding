History[edit]
The company was organized in 1969. It was formerly known as DMG, Inc., and changed its name to Diversified Mortgage Investors, Inc., in 1978, then to Danaher Corporation in 1984. In June 1986, Danaher purchased Chicago Pneumatic ("CP") who had just recently merged in July 1984 with a sister company The Jacobs Manufacturing Company ("Jacobs") and who had purchased Matco Tools Corporation ("MTC") in April 1981. Danaher sold CP in June 1987, retaining Jacobs, including its Matco Tools Division. Jacobs' name was changed to Matco Tools Corporation in November 1991, and the other divisions within Jacobs were established as separate operating companies. In January 1993, Danaher formed NMTC, Inc., which acquired a substantial portion of the assets of MTC, including the existing distributorship agreements of MTC.
The company is named after Danaher Creek in Montana where the Rales brothers, Steven and Mitchell, went fishing.[6]
Within two years of Danaher Corporation's founding in 1984, Danaher Corporation acquired 12 companies as part of a strategy to enter the manufacturing business. Therefore, in 1986 Danaher added Qualitrol to its instrumentation unit.[7] The unit also included Gilbarco Veeder-Root's underground fuel storage sensors, Dynapar's motion sensors[8] and Qualitrol's pressure and temperature measurement instruments, used on the electrical transformer industry.[9]
The Danaher Motion group acquired Kollmorgen, of Radford, Virginia.[10]
2005-2006[edit]
UK-based West Instruments provides control and measurement instrumentation solutions and services for the global industrial and process markets. German instrumentation manufacturer PMA was added to the Industrial Controls Group in 2005 and enhances the range of control and measurement instrumentation solutions.
In July 2005, Danaher Announces Definitive Agreement To Acquire Leica Microsystems.[11] The company manufactures a broad range of products for numerous applications requiring microscopic imaging, measurement and analysis. It also offers system solutions in the areas of Life Science including biotechnology and medicine, as well as the science of raw materials and industrial quality assurance.
2007-2008[edit]
In early 2007 Danaher acquired Australian Pathology Instrument and Engineering company Vision Systems Limited.[12] Also in 2007, Danaher made its largest acquisition to date, the purchase of Tektronix, Inc. for 2.85 billion USD.[13][14]
2009-2010[edit]
In 2009 Danaher purchased the Analytical Technologies business unit of Canadian Life Sciences company MDS, Inc. for $650 million USD.[15] In a separate, but related transaction, Danaher agreed with Life Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: LIFE) to acquire the remaining 50% ownership position in AB SCIEX for $450 million USD, leaving Danaher as outright owner of AB SCIEX and Molecular Devices. The aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions is $1.1 billion.[16]
2011-2012[edit]
In 2011 Danaher entered into a definitive merger agreement with Beckman Coulter[17][18] and sold Accu-sort to Datalogic.
In October 2012, Danaher Corporation and Cooper Industries agreed to sell their joint venture, Apex Tool Group, to Bain Capital for a fee of around $1.6 billion.[19] In December 2012 Danaher Corporation acquired Navman Wireless, a provider of on-demand fleet and asset management technology.[20]
2013-2014[edit]
In September 2014, Danaher Corp is to buy Nobel Biocare for an $2.2 billion to become the world's biggest player in a dental implants market benefiting from growing demand for cosmetic dentistry.[21] In October 2014, Danaher Corp announced it would be combining its communications unit with NetScout Systems to match sector interest in cybersecurity.[22] The action was completed in July 2015[23]
2015-Present[edit]
In May 2015, Danaher Corp announced the acquisition of Pall for $13.8 billion.[24] Acquisition was completed August 2015[25]
In June 2016, Danaher spun off several subsidiaries, including Matco and AMMCO-COATS, to create Fortive.[26] In September of the same year, the company announced it would acquire Cepheid for $4 billion (including debt).[27]
Phenomenex acquisition[edit]
in 2016 October, Danaher Corporation acquired Phenomenex for $ 700 Million to expand in life sciences space.[28]

History[edit]
The company was organized in 1969. It was formerly known as DMG, Inc., and changed its name to Diversified Mortgage Investors, Inc., in 1978, then to Danaher Corporation in 1984. In June 1986, Danaher purchased Chicago Pneumatic ("CP") who had just recently merged in July 1984 with a sister company The Jacobs Manufacturing Company ("Jacobs") and who had purchased Matco Tools Corporation ("MTC") in April 1981. Danaher sold CP in June 1987, retaining Jacobs, including its Matco Tools Division. Jacobs' name was changed to Matco Tools Corporation in November 1991, and the other divisions within Jacobs were established as separate operating companies. In January 1993, Danaher formed NMTC, Inc., which acquired a substantial portion of the assets of MTC, including the existing distributorship agreements of MTC.
The company is named after Danaher Creek in Montana where the Rales brothers, Steven and Mitchell, went fishing.[6]
Within two years of Danaher Corporation's founding in 1984, Danaher Corporation acquired 12 companies as part of a strategy to enter the manufacturing business. Therefore, in 1986 Danaher added Qualitrol to its instrumentation unit.[7] The unit also included Gilbarco Veeder-Root's underground fuel storage sensors, Dynapar's motion sensors[8] and Qualitrol's pressure and temperature measurement instruments, used on the electrical transformer industry.[9]
The Danaher Motion group acquired Kollmorgen, of Radford, Virginia.[10]
2005-2006[edit]
UK-based West Instruments provides control and measurement instrumentation solutions and services for the global industrial and process markets. German instrumentation manufacturer PMA was added to the Industrial Controls Group in 2005 and enhances the range of control and measurement instrumentation solutions.
In July 2005, Danaher Announces Definitive Agreement To Acquire Leica Microsystems.[11] The company manufactures a broad range of products for numerous applications requiring microscopic imaging, measurement and analysis. It also offers system solutions in the areas of Life Science including biotechnology and medicine, as well as the science of raw materials and industrial quality assurance.
2007-2008[edit]
In early 2007 Danaher acquired Australian Pathology Instrument and Engineering company Vision Systems Limited.[12] Also in 2007, Danaher made its largest acquisition to date, the purchase of Tektronix, Inc. for 2.85 billion USD.[13][14]
2009-2010[edit]
In 2009 Danaher purchased the Analytical Technologies business unit of Canadian Life Sciences company MDS, Inc. for $650 million USD.[15] In a separate, but related transaction, Danaher agreed with Life Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: LIFE) to acquire the remaining 50% ownership position in AB SCIEX for $450 million USD, leaving Danaher as outright owner of AB SCIEX and Molecular Devices. The aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions is $1.1 billion.[16]
2011-2012[edit]
In 2011 Danaher entered into a definitive merger agreement with Beckman Coulter[17][18] and sold Accu-sort to Datalogic.
In October 2012, Danaher Corporation and Cooper Industries agreed to sell their joint venture, Apex Tool Group, to Bain Capital for a fee of around $1.6 billion.[19] In December 2012 Danaher Corporation acquired Navman Wireless, a provider of on-demand fleet and asset management technology.[20]
2013-2014[edit]
In September 2014, Danaher Corp is to buy Nobel Biocare for an $2.2 billion to become the world's biggest player in a dental implants market benefiting from growing demand for cosmetic dentistry.[21] In October 2014, Danaher Corp announced it would be combining its communications unit with NetScout Systems to match sector interest in cybersecurity.[22] The action was completed in July 2015[23]
2015-Present[edit]
In May 2015, Danaher Corp announced the acquisition of Pall for $13.8 billion.[24] Acquisition was completed August 2015[25]
In June 2016, Danaher spun off several subsidiaries, including Matco and AMMCO-COATS, to create Fortive.[26] In September of the same year, the company announced it would acquire Cepheid for $4 billion (including debt).[27]

Description



Access to case studies expires six months after purchase date.



Publication Date: February 12, 2008

 To maximize their effectiveness, color cases should be printed in color.Between 1985 and 2007, Danaher has been one of the best-performing industrial conglomerates in the U.S. This case examines the corporate strategy of this diversified, global corporation. It describes the firm's portfolio strategy and the Danaher Business System-a systematic and wide-ranging set of organizational processes the firm has developed to drive growth and create value. In 2008, the firm confronts various challenges in sustaining its impressive historical performance. First, can it continue to balance organic and acquisition-led growth? Second, what will be the impact of increased competition from private equity players? Third, for how long can its strategy of "continuous improvement" continue?

We love to help!What are the primary advantages of a C Corporation?The C Corporation structure is very similar to the C Corporation, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that C Corporations are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows C Corporation owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. Are there any restrictions on who can file to form a C Corporation?Outside of some state-specific regulations that require individuals to be 18 to own a business, there are no restrictions on who can form a corporation. However, if a corporation decides to elect for C Corporation status, there are several restrictions placed on who can become part of the organizations ownership. They are as follows:• All C Corporation shareholders must be legal citizens of the United States. • C Corporations are only able to distribute one uniform class of stock. • C Corporation are limited to 100 different shareholders • Subsidiary organizations may not have an ownership interest in a C Corporation; all shareholders must be individuals.  What are the tax implications of a C Corporation?One of the most common reasons that business owners elect to form a C Corporation is that the structure is eligible for pass-through taxation. Under this special tax status, the corporation is never taxed on its income. Instead, each individual owner is taxed on the company's profits and losses, as they are distributed and reflected on their personal income tax returns. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form a C Corporation?Most states only require one director in order to start a C Corporation. However, some states impose a minimum number of directors based on the number of shareholders the company has. This required number is typically never lower than three and there is no maximum limit.
