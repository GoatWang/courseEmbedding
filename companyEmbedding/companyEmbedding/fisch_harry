Home / FAQ



FAQ


Q. WHAT IS PREMATURE EJACULATION?
A. For all practical purposes, premature ejaculation occurs when a man ejaculates sooner during sexual intercourse than he or his partner would like.
Q. WHAT CAN COUPLES DO ABOUT PREMATURE EJACULATION?
A. Overcoming premature ejaculation is easiest when both partners are involved in finding a solution. Accordingly, all treatments, including PREBOOST, work best when both partners are willing to talk about sex and are comfortable experimenting with more satisfying ways to have sex.
Q. WHAT IS PREBOOST?
A. PREBOOST is a safe, effective, and easy way for couples to address premature ejaculation. A single PREBOOST wipe is all it takes to slow down the experience so couples can have more pleasurable, more satisfying sex.
Q. HOW DOES PREBOOST WORK?
A. PREBOOST® contains 4% benzocaine. When applied to the penis, PREBOOST reduces your sensitivity, but won’t affect the sensitivity of your partner, or your ability to have an orgasm.
Q. HOW DO I APPLY PREBOOST?
A. Simply tear open the foil, remove the wipe and apply the wipe to the head and shaft of the penis, approximately 10 minutes before intercourse. After the product has desensitized the penis, use a wet washcloth to wipe off the penis. Avoid contact with the eyes. Do not use if you or your partner has irritated or broken skin.
Q. HOW QUICKLY DOES PREBOOST WORK?
A.   PREBOOST works in approximately 5 to 10 minutes.
Q. WILL PREBOOST TRANSFER TO MY PARTNER?
A.  Once PREBOOST is absorbed, it generally will not transfer, but to be sure and especially if oral sex may be on “the menu”, just wait approximately 5-10 minutes after application and wipe the penis with a damp washcloth.
Q. IS PREBOOST COMPATIBLE WITH CONDOMS?
A. Yes. PREBOOST can be used with latex and non-latex condoms. PREBOOST does not prevent sexually transmitted diseases, nor is it a contraceptive. It will not prevent pregnancy.
Q. WILL PREBOOST STAIN CLOTHING OR BEDDING?
A. No. PREBOOST will not stain your clothing or bedding.
Q. IS THERE ANYONE WHO SHOULD NOT USE PREBOOST ?
A. PREBOOST is safe, effective, and generally, can be used as needed. However, do not use PREBOOST if your partner is or may be pregnant, or if you or your partner is allergic to benzocaine, the active ingredient in PREBOOST. PREBOOST also should not be used on irritated or broken skin, or by anyone under treatment for liver or kidney disease.
Q. DOES PREBOOST HAVE A FRAGRANCE?
A. No. PREBOOST is free of any fragrance.
Q. HOW IS PREBOOST PACKAGED AND DELIVERED?
A. PREBOOST wipes are packaged in individual foil wraps with 10 to a box. PREBOOST will be delivered to you in plain packaging.

Testosterone and Replacement










What is Testosterone?
Testosterone is a sex hormone produced by the testes that stimulates the development of male sexual characteristics, such as the penis and testes, muscle size, vocal cords and bones, pubic hair, facial hair and the Adam’s apple. Production of testosterone in the testes is controlled by the brain and pituitary gland.
What Are the Symptoms of Low Testosterone?
The symptoms of low testosterone, also known as hypogonadism, are often overlooked because they are mistaken for ordinary signs of aging. Men with below-normal testosterone may experience the following symptoms:

low interest in sex
tiredness
muscle weakness
small or soft testicles
erectile dysfunction
weight gain, particularly around the waist
reduced bone density
depression
anemia

Low testosterone can be resolved in a number of different ways.
 





What Causes Low Testosterone?


Low testosterone can be caused by many factors, all of which play out against the normal, steady decline in testosterone levels with age. Abnormally low testosterone — one of the major signals of an advanced biological clock — can safely be restored.  Read More




Facts To Know About Testosterone


Between two and four million men in the US alone suffer from below-normal testosterone levels, a condition known as hypogonadism. Myths and misunderstandings about testosterone abound. Here are ten facts that are the most important to understand about testosterone.  Read More




Testosterone Replacement Therapy


The safest ways to deliver testosterone is through the skin with gels or patches or directly into the blood via injections. These approaches differ in how well they create an even, natural level of testosterone.   Read More




An Alternative Solution for Low-T


Clomiphene citrate can stimulate sperm production and sperm quality in men with reduced testicular function.   Read More




OTC Products for Low Testosterone


In the quest for bigger muscles, improved athletic performance or enhanced sexuality, hundreds of thousands of men have turned to over-the-counter compounds that purport to boost testosterone. Some of these products are actually fake versions of FDA-approved products such as testosterone patches or gels. Others contain compounds that are converted to testosterone in the body.  Read More

Dr. Fisch has spent his entire career working for the betterment of men's health, through all stages of a man's life. He has authored dozens of papers, written three books, spoken at conferences and meetings, and had the only weekly radio show devoted only to topics surrounding men's health.
 





Male Infertility


Many couples have difficulty in conceiving their first pregnancy while other couples experience problems after being able to get pregnant in the past. In either case, stress and grief are common reactions. Infertility itself is also pretty common: It affects about 10 to 15 percent of couples.   Read More

Testosterone is a sex hormone produced by the testes that stimulates the development of male sexual characteristics. The symptoms of low testosterone, also known as hypogonadism, are often overlooked because they are mistaken for ordinary signs of aging. Men with below-normal testosterone may experience the following symptoms...   Read More




Erectile Dysfunction


Erectile dysfunction usually begins as a purely physical problem with blood vessels, nerves, or other parts of the male reproductive machinery. But very rapidly a complicated psychological dimension is layered onto the physical problem ...  Read More




Premature Ejaculation


The number one male sexual problem is premature ejaculation—ejaculation that occurs sooner than desired, either before or shortly after penetration, causing distress to one or both partners. Roughly one in five men between the ages of 18 and 60 experience premature ejaculation.   Read More




Prostate Health


There are several symptoms that men may exhibit that call for an evaluation of prostate health. In some cases, men begin to experience changes in urination, and in others, a PSA test with an elevated result may initiate a referral to a urologist for a prostate health workup.   Read More




Testicular Pain


Testicle pain (testicular pain) is pain that emanates from one or both testicles. There are actually three unique areas which could be causing the pain – the testicle itself, the epididymis, which is a tube that delivers sperm, or another area of the groin. In this case, the pain can be felt in the testicles but is really originating from somewhere else.   Read More

OTC Products for Low Testosterone




In the quest for bigger muscles, improved athletic performance or enhanced sexuality, hundreds of thousands of men have turned to over-the-counter compounds that purport to boost testosterone. Some of these products are actually fake versions of FDA-approved products such as testosterone patches or gels. Others contain compounds that are converted to testosterone in the body. The most common of these testosterone precursors are dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione. The latter gained notoriety in the late 1990s when baseball slugger Mark McGwire disclosed that he routinely used “andros.”
Scientific studies of both precursors using recommended doses of 100 to 300 mg a day have failed to prove any of the sometimes outlandish claims made by manufacturers. Nonetheless, many anecdotal reports suggest that some men do see results from these compounds, such as added strength and bigger muscles. The explanation for the discrepancy is undoubtedly that many men are using doses far higher than those suggested by the manufacturers and higher than those used in the scientific studies.
The bottom line is that precursor compounds do end up as testosterone and, thus, all of the risks noted above apply to them. It doesn’t matter that the testosterone is produced by the body in this case—the extra testosterone will impair fertility, bring a man’s natural testosterone production to a screeching halt, and increase his risk for prostate cancer, heart attack and stroke.
The safest approach is to simply avoid all nutritional supplements if you and your partner are trying to have a baby because many contain hormones or hormone precursors that can hurt fertility and ingredients are often labeled in deceptive ways.
The array of products now available is so huge and the number of brand names so large that a comprehensive list isn’t feasible. In general, however, any supplement containing the following ingredients or which include the following words should be suspect:

testosterone
dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
androstenedione
androstenediol
prohormone
prehormone
“hormone”
“anabolic”

Men should also avoid any products that claim to boost energy because they often contain a stimulating compound such as ephedra, caffeine and analogs of amphetamine. Such stimulants can impair ejaculatory function and reduce the amount of semen ejaculated at orgasm. Compounds containing human growth hormone (HGH) or claiming to boost growth hormone should be avoided as well. Research on the potential effects of such products on fertility has not been done, but we do know that such hormones stimulate all growth in the body, including the growth of cancerous and non-cancerous tumors.

Manual Methods


“I’m not going to tell you to think about baseball. Baseball is the last thing you want to be thinking about when you’re having sex.”  – Dr. Harry Fisch
How to Delay Ejaculation: Manual Methods
Taking matters into your own hands
Premature ejaculation is the most common sexual problem facing men of all ages, especially those under the age of 40. And while PREBOOST provides a safe and effective method for slowing down a man’s sexual response, there are a few other tried-and-true techniques that you and your partner can use to help slow things down. Here are a few approaches to try:
Breath control
Some men have found that deep breathing can help control the tension and arousal that can lead to premature ejaculation. Try to avoid shallow breathing, which can speed up your heartbeat and cause sex to end too soon for you or your partner. Your goal: spend five seconds taking in one deep breath, hold it for three seconds, then exhale for five seconds. Try to keep this going, and it may help you delay ejaculation.
Stop-and-start
This technique of withdrawal or ceasing movement helps build control by slowing things down when you’re on the edge of orgasm. This can be done during intercourse or you can practice during masturbation. They key is learning to feel your “point of no return” and stopping before you go too far.
The squeeze
Similar to the stop-and-start method (and often done at the same time), this approach involves you or your partner squeezing the penis just below the head when you feel you’re close to orgasm. Other options are squeezing the base of your penis, pressing on the perineum (the skin between the anus and the scrotum), or gently pulling your testes down and away from your body. These techniques can help slow things down and help make sex last longer.
Kegel exercises
The muscle that you use to control ejaculation is the same muscle that you use to stop urinating in mid-stream. To exercise this muscle, start with a full bladder and quickly clench and release the muscle repeatedly for ten seconds. Work up to three sets, with a 10-second break between sets. Remember to only engage this muscle rather than using your abdominals, buttocks or thighs. These other muscles should be kept relaxed during these exercises and while controlling ejaculation during sex.
Different positions
If certain sexual positions feel better to you than others, you may want to try the others. For example, some men orgasm quickly in the missionary position while being underneath takes longer. With your partner’s cooperation, this approach may help both of you enjoy sex longer.
Desensitizing the skin
The techniques described above can help extend a man’s sexual response time, but some of them can interrupt the rhythm of sex, which can be frustrating if your partner is close to having an orgasm. Many men have found that the best solution is a combination of these approaches plus PREBOOST pre-moistened wipes, which slightly desensitize the penis without interfering with pleasure or orgasm.
Include your partner
If you’re going to try something new in bed, it’s a good idea to involve your partner in the process. For many couples, a “team approach” helps you both to pay better attention to each others needs and increases the likelihood that you’ll both enjoy sex more.
