Jenn, Laura and Family    We are very sorry to hear of Gus, passing. We always enjoyed his company at different gatherings. He was a good man and a good friend.

Robert E. Griffin Jr., a giant in Boston's commercial real estate and philanthropic communities, is leaving his long-time post as the head of New England capital markets team for Cushman & Wakefield.
Griffin and his team have consistently ranked among the region's top performers when it comes to selling and financing major real estate transactions involving many of Greater Boston's most prominent properties. Griffin also is the founding chair of Champion for Children's, a multimillion-dollar fundraiser for Boston Children's Hospital.

                            Robert E. Griffin Jr. has left brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.                        
W. Marc Bernsau | Business Journ










 


The move comes less than a month after the “game-changing”$2.04 billion deal to merge national brokerages Cushman & Wakefield and DTZ closed on Sept. 2.




"Rob Griffin has been a valuable part of Cushman & Wakefield, and we wish him the best of luck on this new chapter in his career," said Joseph Stettinius Jr., Cushman & Wakefield's CEO of the Americas, in an emailed statement. "Our sights are set on strategically growing a single capital markets platform across product types and markets to consistently serve clients when and where they see opportunities."
Citing industry sources, the Real Reporter said Griffin and his team have left to join brokerage Newmark Grubb Knight Frank in Boston. A representative from New York-based BGC Partners Inc. (Nasdaq: BGCP), the parent company of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, declined to comment on that speculation. Michael Edward, executive vice president and managing director of NGKF in Boston, did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Catherine Carlock covers Greater Boston's commercial real estate industry.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Griffin, Robert E Jr carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Griffin, Robert E Jr



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Griffin, Robert E Jr



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Griffin, Robert E Jr



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).
