COMPANY PROFILE
China Auto Logistics (NasdaqGM:CALI)
China Auto Logistics Inc, founded in Tianjin 15 years ago, was listed on NASDAQ in June, 2009, and elevated to NASDAQ Global Market in January, 2010.
As China has grown to become the global leader in Internet usage and the world's number one auto market, China Auto Logistics Inc., with revenues in 2010 of $257,681,456, has built leading positions at the intersection of these two dynamic growth industries and is well poised to take full advantage of the significant opportunity for continuing rapid expansion they each provide.

We are China's number one wholesaler of imported luxury vehicles as well as its leading provider of "one stop" auto-related logistical and financial services with a network of more than 3000 automobile dealers throughout the country.
In 2010, we established  www.cali.com.cn, the leading automobile portal for China's car dealers, buyers and drivers of domestic and imported vehicles.  On this portal, viewers have one- click access to three of the leading automobile sites in China developed and operated by us.  While imported auto sales constituted approximately 96% of 2010 revenues, growth in our combined highly profitable web-based advertising and subscriptions revenues (+72%) has been the key contributor to our rapid bottom line growth (+44% in 2010).

                        Our pioneering website for imported car dealers and buyers,  www.at188.com, is the sole on-line site in China for complete, up-to-date information on imported vehicle sales, parts and pricing as well as our auto-related services, including short-term dealer financing supported by our $135 million (as of June 30, 2011) line of credit with leading Chinese banks.
                        
Our widely viewed  www.at160.com site provides the most comprehensive, up to date information on domestic vehicles in 35 cities throughout China, which we expect to expand to 60 cities by 2012.
Most recently, we acquired the highly popular  www.goodcar.cn, where the rapidly growing automobile driver population in China can obtain coupons and memberships providing discounts on a variety of auto services, including extremely popular 5% discounts on gas purchases based on arrangements we have made with China's leading gas retailers.

We also successfully operate through a service contract the largest imported auto mall in Tianjin, which is the number port in China for imported vehicles.  Currently, we are in the advanced planning stage of acquiring what will be the largest domestic automobile mall in Tianjin with an aim of greatly expanding our sales and auto-related services in the much larger domestic auto market.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.30      Net Money Flow ($)  -5,921    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.               Advertisement         Competitors CALI   Data temporarily not available.

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
