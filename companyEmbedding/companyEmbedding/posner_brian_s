INVESTING WITH: Brian S. Posner; Warburg Pincus Growth and Income Fund

IF sheer assets were the benchmark for success in the fund business, then the move of Brian S. Posner to Warburg Pincus Asset Management would have been a humbling one.At Fidelity Investments, he built his reputation as a value investor at the Equity-Income II fund, which had $15.5 billion in assets when he left. By contrast, his new fund assignment, Warburg Pincus Growth and Income, had less than one-thirtieth of that amount, under $500 million, when he took over.Of course, Mr. Posner and other people at at Warburg Pincus don't measure success that way. They point to performance. Since he joined the firm as a partner and portfolio manager in January 1997, Mr. Posner has raised the performance of the Growth and Income fund, formerly a laggard, to the top quartile among its peers in the last 12 months. And its assets have grown to almost $1 billion.Mr. Posner's presence is being felt throughout Warburg Pincus, which manages $22 billion in retail and institutional assets, as he takes on increasing management responsibilities. He is now director of large-capitalization domestic stock research and head of the firm's global asset allocation committee.

''He has reinvigorated people here with his commitment to excellence,'' said Arnold M. Reichman, chief operating officer of Warburg Pincus, a private firm that began selling its funds to the public only in 1992. Continue reading the main story

Known for his personable nature, Mr. Posner has encouraged a less formal exchange of ideas among analysts. That, in turn, has helped Warburg Pincus portfolio managers gain insights into companies that otherwise may have remained only scribbles in an analyst's notebook.''I've always found the more you can get analysts to talk about companies, the more ideas that get generated,'' Mr. Posner said. The Warburg Pincus Balanced fund, which Mr. Posner plans to help run, will also draw on the large-cap domestic stock research, as funds like Strategic Value and Capital Appreciation already do.Mr. Posner, 36, said he had longed to play a bigger role in building a business. At Fidelity, he said, ''my opportunities did not go much beyond running a fund.''So how is Growth and Income performing under Mr. Posner? Since he took over, it has returned 34.5 percent, annualized, through April 10, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago. That beats the 30.7 percent return for the average large-capitalization value stock fund, though it lags behind the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, at 38.5 percent.But if history is a guide, Mr. Posner's fund will close the gap with the S.& P. over time while taking on less risk. Fidelity Equity-Income II had an annualized total return of 17.1 percent during Mr. Posner's tenure, from April 1992 to December 1996, just shy of the 17.2 percent for the S.& P. But the fund's price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios were typically far below those of the index, and Mr. Posner figures that the fund was only 75 percent as risky. And Equity-Income II easily beat its average peer fund, which returned just 15.6 percent, annualized, over that period. (Under Mr. Posner's successor, the veteran Fidelity manager Bettina Doulton, Equity-Income II has continued to do well, returning an annualized 32.1 percent though April 10.)Mr. Posner is running the Growth and Income fund much as he did Fidelity Equity-Income II. One difference, he said, is that he does not have to compete with other Fidelity managers when he buys a stock; if he likes something, he can buy as much as he wants. Another is that Growth and Income is smaller, so he can own fewer stocks. There are about 100 companies in Growth and Income; Equity-Income II had about 170, he said.The core of his approach is what Mr. Posner likes to call ''absolute valuation.'' It is a combination of fundamental, kick-the-tires, talk-to-management analysis and ''valuation analysis,'' which weighs earnings as well as present and future return and risk. A key measure is free cash, which in effect is earnings that can be reinvested or passed on to shareholders.

''I want to make sure on an absolute basis, in isolation, I can make money on this company,'' Mr. Posner said.

Mr. Posner is nothing if not patient. He may pore over numbers for years before he takes the plunge on a stock. A favorite example is British Petroleum. The company was in dire straits during the early 1990's and announced a major restructuring in August 1992. Mr. Posner made a few trips to Britain to explore the situation and quickly began buying the American depositary receipts, then trading at about $22.''Shortly thereafter it became one of my largest positions,'' Mr. Posner said. The A.D.R.'s are now at $89.6875.He still likes B.P., which makes up 2.8 percent of Growth and Income's portfolio.  The company has announced a major share buyback and plans to increase production by 25 percent over the next five years; Mr. Posner thinks the stock may climb as high as $120 a share in the next 12 months.Another long-term favorite is Unova Inc., a $1 billion industrial technology company based in Beverly Hills, Calif., that was spun off last October by Western Atlas, an oil-services concern. Unova traded as low as  $14.1875 a share in January and is now at $22.375, or under 16 times 1999 per-share earnings estimates. Mr. Posner describes Unova as ''the proverbial eight-cylinder car running on four cylinders'' that will soon take off and could hit the high $20's in the near term.The company designs and builds manufacturing lines for engine makers, as well as bar-code systems for various commercial uses. Last year, the company's bar code business had to digest acquisitions, depressing operating margins.Mr. Posner, however, focused on the company's ability to generate free cash, which he expects to climb to $1.40 a share in 1999 from about $1.10 a share in 1998, and on its ability to eventually expand its businesses.Not all of Mr. Posner's stocks are holdovers from his Fidelity days. His new analysts have brought some new stocks to his attention, like Gulfstream Aerospace, the maker of private jets.Mr. Posner was convinced by his defense and aerospace analyst that the GV, Gulfstream's newest jet, would be introduced on time and on budget. Moreover, he estimated that Gulfstream's free cash could hit $3.25 to $3.50 a share in 1999, versus $2.25 a share in 1998. He bought the stock last spring when it was trading at about $24; it is now at $45.75.Mr. Posner also keeps his eye on the portfolio mix, balancing volatile and steady stocks to keep the fund's risk in check. But as stock prices have climbed, Mr. Posner has had more difficulty finding stocks he likes. He is looking into semiconductor equipment makers and disk drive manufacturers, though he is not convinced that any are worth buying yet.

In general, Mr. Posner says this is a time to exercise caution in the market, and not to swing for the fences. ''In this environment, consistent with the diversification in the portfolio and risk management, it's about doubles and singles and moving the runners and not striking out,'' he said.
