Lowell Junkins





 


   




 

 





Lowell Junkins was born, 
raised and educated in Iowa. While always maintaining his roots as a farmer and 
agrarian, he also has been an entrepreneur. After attending Iowa State, he was 
involved in a number of successful business ventures from home and business 
development, construction, real estate to owning a health care delivery 
business. 
Junkins' career in politics 
began with the Montrose City Council and from there he was elected Mayor of 
Montrose, Iowa. He was the Democratic candidate for the Iowa House of 
Representatives in Lee County in 1970. Although that race was unsuccessful, he 
was determined to continue in public service and was elected to the Iowa State 
Senate in 1972. He was reelected by an ever-increasing margin in each subsequent 
election. In 1982, he ran unopposed in his bid for a fourth term in the Iowa 
Senate.
He was elected Minority 
Leader of the Iowa State Senate in 1981 and elected Majority Leader of the Iowa 
State Senate in 1983. Lowell was instrumental in the passage of many important 
initiatives. He is remembered for writing and passing the most sweeping jobs 
bill in Iowa history in 1983, which focused on stimulating economic development 
in many different sectors of Iowa's economy. After winning a closely contested 
primary, Lowell was the Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate for the State of Iowa 
in 1986. 
After that race, he decided 
to form the firm of Lowell Junkins & Associates to combine his knowledge of 
public and private sectors into a political consulting firm that specializes in 
areas of political strategy and campaign management. He then developed American 
Management and Consultants, Inc. to provide an additional range of services that 
allow him to advocate for both public and private organizations. He also served 
as Clinton/Gore 1992 National Deputy Campaign Manager, and has since continued 
to build the political side of the consulting firm into a group with a national 
presence.
Presidents Clinton and Bush 
appointed him to the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac 
Board) where he now serves as Acting Chairman. 
He is the Governor�s 
appointee as Iowa�s Commissioner to the Mid-America Port Commission, a tri-state 
port authority effort.
During his 5 years as 
Executive Director of Lee County Economic Development Group Inc. he advocated 
and wrote legislation that assisted Lee County businesses as well as those 
throughout the state. His efforts along with other economic and community 
development partners resulted in successes such as the following:
Siemens Power Generation 
A/S, one of the premier companies in the international power generation sector, 
recently selected Lee County for its first blade factory in the U.S. The company 
plans to employ over 250 people in the manufacture of blades in a facility that 
had been vacant for several years. Companion companies and suppliers are 
planning to relocate to the area. 
Because of Lowell�s 
networking and marketing skills, he enticed a Fortune 500 entrepreneur to Lee 
County. The entrepreneur invested in the Southeastern Iowa Port Terminal 
(formerly the Iowa Gateway Terminal) and the Hendricks River Logistics Company 
(formerly Orba-Johnson). Over 50 jobs were retained and additional employment 
opportunities should be available soon through expansion plans for both 
facilities. 
Lowell facilitated a land 
swap with the State of Iowa for a local business expansion project and assisted 
in negotiating retention of a Fort Madison business retaining 90 jobs and adding 
50 new jobs. 
Lowell and the LCEDG 
improved the business environment by working with Lee County�s State 
Representative and Senator to introduce or change legislation impacting Lee 
County and Iowa businesses such as providing for a tax reimbursement for a 
Keokuk company. Lowell also worked with legislators to establish a new Employee 
Tax Credit program and to change Enterprise Zone criteria to give Keokuk and 
Fort Madison new development tools. 
The major piece of 
legislation crafted by Lowell allows for the establishments of port authorities 
in Iowa. Lowell serves as Chairman of Iowa�s first port authority, the Southeast 
Iowa Regional Economic and Port Authority (SIREPA). 
Lowell 
recently (2007) completed his contract as Executive director of the Lee County 
Economic Development Group, Inc, which he founded in 2002. After Lowell left 
LCEDG, he formed Integrated Energy Company (IEC) to develop and promote the use 
of alternative energy, biotechnology, and biofuels production in Lee County Iowa 
and across America.
