Net

net,

 

the

 

Fund

 

has

 

managed

 

through

 

the

 

volatile

 

markets

 

so

 

far

 

this

 

year

 

to

 

deliver

 

essentially

 

flat

 

performance,

 

outperforming

 

the

 

markets

 

on

 

a

 

relative

 

basis,

 

and

 

protecting

 

capital

 

which

 

sets

 

up

 

the

 

Fund

 

with

 

a

 

portfolio

 

that

 

has

 

significant

 

upside

 

potential

 

in

 

2012.

 

On

 

the

 

positive

 

side,

 

the

 

Fund

 

has

 

been

 

able

 

to

 

generate

 

alpha

 

on

 

both

 

the

 

long

 

and

 

short

 

side

 

this

 

year.

 

We’ve

 

had

 

a

 

fairly

 

high

 

hit

 

ratio

 

on

 

our

 

single

 

name

 

longs

 

and

 

shorts

 

which

 

has

 

produced

 

the

 

Fund’s

 

flattish

 

performance

 

despite

 

having

 

average

 

net

 

equity

 

exposure

 

of 

 

50

‐

60%

 

for

 

the

 

year.

 

In

 

particular,

 

Sun

 

Art,

 

Brilliance,

 

Aiful,

 

and

 

QR

 

National

 

have

 

been

 

large

 

contributors

 

on

 

the

 

long

 

side,

 

and

 

on

 

the

 

short

 

side,

 

Taiwanese

 

airlines,

 

construction

 

machinery,

 

and

 

the

 

heavy

 

duty

 

truck

 

segment

 

in

 

China

 

have

 

worked

 

out

 

well.

 

What

 

we

 

have

 

gotten

 

wrong

 

is

 

our

 

large

 

net

 

exposure

 

to

 

the

 

equity

 

markets,

 

which

 

was

 

the

 

reason

 

for

 

the

 

Fund’s

 

drawdown

 

in

 

August

 

and

 

September.

 

We

 

did

 

not

 

have

 

single

 

names

 

that

 

performed

 

disproportionately

 

worse

 

than

 

their

 

beta

‐

exposure

 

would

 

suggest

 

nor

 

did

 

we

 

have

 

an

 

issue

 

with

 

our

 

gross

 

exposures.

 

We

 

were

 

simply

 

too

 

net

 

long

 

going

 

into

 

a

 

severe

 

downturn

 

in

 

the

 

equity

 

markets.

 

Inception

 

Date

 

was

 

July

 

2,

 

2007.

 

The

 

graph

 

above

 

reflects

 

the

 

composition

 

of 

 

Owl

 

Creek

 

Asia

 

Master

 

Fund,

 

Ltd's

 

portfolio

 

at

 

each

 

month

 

end.

 

The

 

composition

 

of 

 

the

 

portfolio

 

will

 

vary

 

daily.

 

Exposure

 

includes

 

the

 

notional

 

exposure

 

of 

 

total

 

return

 

swaps

 

and

 

futures

 

contracts.

 

As

 

we

 

have

 

written

 

about

 

in

 

our

 

previous

 

letters,

 

we

 

believed

 

this

 

exposure

 

was

 

 justified

 

because

 

of 

 

the

 

compelling

 

and

 

event

‐

driven

 

nature

 

of 

 

the

 

bottoms

‐

up

 

opportunities

 

we

 

found

 

and

 

our

 

top

 

down

 

view

 

that

 

the

 

markets

 

would

 

do

 

okay.

 

While

 

we

 

have

 

gotten

 

the

 

bottoms

‐

up

 

mostly

 

right,

 

our

 

top

 

down

 

view

 

has

 

clearly

 

been

 

wrong

 

this

 

year.

 

We’ve

 

always

 

believed

 

our

 

strengths

 

are

 

in

 

the

 

bottoms

 

up,

 

the

 

micro…

 

the

 

alpha.

 

But

 

by

 

having

 

such

 

a

 

large

 

net

 

equity

 

exposure,

 

we

 

were

 

making

 

implicit

 

bets

 

on

 

the

 

macro…

 

on

 

the

 

beta…

 

that

 

we’ve

 

had

 

less

 

conviction

 

in.

 

We

 

feel

 

that

 

by

 

having

 

a

 

smaller

 

net

 

exposure,

 

our

 

performance

 

will

 

be

 

more

 

representative

 

of 

 

our

 

strengths

 

and

 

that

 

we

 

will

 

also

 

be

 

able

 

to

 

manage

 

through

 

the

 

volatility

 

of 

 

the

 

markets

 

more

 

effectively.

 

We

 

remain

 

long

‐

biased

 

and

 

do

 

want

 

some

 

market

 

exposure,

 

but

 

given

 

how

 

uncertain

 

we

 

expect

 

the

 

macro

 

environment

 

to

 

remain

 

for

 

the

 

foreseeable

 

future

 

(years,

 

not

 

months),

 

we

 

think

 

it

 

is

 

prudent

 

to

 

run

 

with

 

smaller

 

nets

 

going

 

forward.

 

So,

 

we

 

expect

 

to

 

run

 

with

 
























 

3

a

 

narrower

 

range

 

of 

 

net

 

equity

 

exposure

 

going

 

forward,

 

in

 

the

 

0

‐

50%

 

range

 

versus

 

our

 

historical

 

range

 

of 

 

about

 

0

‐

80%.

 

At

 

the

 

end

 

of 

 

November,

 

our

 

net

 

equity

 

exposure

 

was

 

approximately

 

35%.

 

We

 

continue

 

to

 

like

 

the

 

micro

 

stories

 

behind

 

our

 

names,

 

on

 

both

 

the

 

long

 

and

 

short

 

side,

 

and

 

feel

 

that

 

the

 

market

 

is

 

pricing

 

in

 

a

 

much

 

higher

 

likelihood

 

of 

 

a

 

China

 

hard

 

landing

 

than

 

we

 

believe

 

is

 

warranted.

 

Over

 

the

 

last

 

three

 

months,

 

we

 

have

 

visited

 

about

 

half 

 

of 

 

our

 

portfolio

 

companies

 

and

 

have

 

spoken

 

with

 

all

 

of 

 

them

 

and

 

feel

 

strongly

 

that

 

our

 

investment

 

theses

 

are

 

largely

 

unchanged.

 

We

 

have

 

used

 

the

 

recent

 

volatility

 

in

 

these

 

markets

 

to

 

adjust

 

our

 

portfolio,

 

adding

 

to

 

high

 

conviction

 

names

 

such

 

as

 

China

 

Shanshui,

 

Visteon,

 

Far

 

East

 

Horizon,

 

and

 

Hui

 

Xian

 

REIT

 

while

 

also

 

trimming

 

our

 

winners

 

such

 

as

 

PICC

 

and

 

Brilliance.

 

We’ve

 

added

 

a

 

number

 

of 

 

single

 

name

 

shorts

 

across

 

the

 

construction

 

machinery,

 

consumer,

 

and

 

telecom

 

sectors

 

to

 

replace

 

the

 

index

 

hedges

 

we

 

put

 

on

 

over

 

the

 

last

 

few

 

months.

 

Single

 

name

 

shorts

 

currently

 

represent

 

about

 

85%

 

of 

 

our

 

short

 

book.

 

While

 

the

 

external

 

environment

 

(Europe

 

and

 

US)

 

continues

 

to

 

drive

 

liquidity

 

and

 

the

 

markets

 

in

 

Asia,

 

China

 

remains

 

very

 

much

 

in

 

flux

 

as

 

the

 

year

 

long

 

tightening

 

by

 

the

 

central

 

government

 

has

 

had

 

its

 

desired

 

effect,

 

a

 

slowing

 

Chinese

 

economy

 

and

 

lower

 

inflation.

 

CPI

 

in

 

October

 

was

 

5.5%,

 

down

 

from

 

the

 

peak

 

of 

 

6.5%

 

in

 

July,

 

and

 

we

 

expect

 

it

 

to

 

be

 

around

 

4%

 

by

 

the

 

beginning

 

of 

 

2012.

 

While

 

the

 

very

 

early

 

stages

 

of 

 

easing

 

are

 

starting,

 

liquidity

 

conditions

 

remain

 

tight

 

in

 

China.

 

Property

 

sales

 

continue

 

to

 

slow

 

and

 

housing

 

inventories

 

rise

 

with

 

the

 

home

 

purchase

 

restriction

 

being

 

the

 

primary

 

limiting

 

factor.

 

We

 

expect

 

the

 

next

 

internal

 

catalyst

 

for

 

the

 

Chinese

 

market

 

to

 

be

 

easing

 

in

 

some

 

form

 

of 

 

reserve

 

rate

 

requirement

 

cuts,

 

a

 

loosening

 

in

 

housing,

 

and

 

fiscal

 

stimulus.

 

We

 

remain

 

convinced

 

that

 

a

 

hard

 

landing

 

in

 

China

 

is

 

not

 

in

 

the

 

cards,

 

as

 

the

 

slowdown

 

is

 

primarily

 

self 

‐

inflicted

 

through

 

the

 

tightening

 

which

 

leaves

 

the

 

government

 

room

 

to

 

ease.

 

China’s

 

position

 

contrasts

 

starkly

 

with

 

both

 

Europe

 

and

 

the

 

US,

 

who

 

have

 

zero

 

bound

 

interest

 

rates

 

and

 

huge

 

budget

 

deficits,

 

which

 

makes

 

both

 

monetary

 

and

 

fiscal

 

stimulus

 

exceedingly

 

difficult.

 

On

 

November

 

30,

 

China

 

announced

 

a

 

cut

 

in

 

its

 

reserve

 

rate

 

requirement

 

by

 

50

 

bps

 

which

 

in

 

isolation

 

is

 

not

 

that

 

impactful,

 

but

 

we

 

believe

 

this

 

signals

 

the

 

official

 

beginning

 

of 

 

easing.
