On July 1, 2006, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of 21 Citibank branches in Buffalo and Rochester, New York.[11]
In December 2007, M&T Bank acquired Partners Trust Financial Group, which included 33 branches in upstate New York, for $555 million.[12]

In May 2009, M&T Bank acquired Provident Bank of Maryland in a stock transaction.[13]
On August 28, 2009, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) seized Bradford Bank, and sold all its deposits and most assets to M&T.[14] M&T and the FDIC agreed to share future losses on $338 million worth of Bradford's assets.[15]

In 2008, M&T received a $600 million investment by the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and M&T assumed another $482 million in TARP obligations from its acquisitions.[20] In 2011, the bank repaid $700 million of TARP funds.[20]
Legal issues[edit]
Money laundering[edit]
In June 2014, a U.S. District Judge ordered M&T Bank to forfeit $560,000 in drug proceeds that was laundered through its Perry Hall, Maryland, branch. At least eight times from 2011 to 2013, Deanna Bailey, a drug dealer,[21] went to the branch and had head teller Sabrina Fitts convert cash — amounts from $20,000 to $100,000 — into larger bills. Fitts accepted a 1 percent transaction fee in exchange for not filing a Currency Transaction Report. This violated the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 which requires all transactions of more than $10,000 to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.[22]
M&T Bank's acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp was held up for more than three years by the Federal Reserve Board, which was unconvinced that the bank's anti-laundering controls were strong enough.[23][24]

On July 1, 2006, M&T Bank completed the acquisition of 21 Citibank branches in Buffalo and Rochester, New York.[11]

In 2008, M&T received a $600 million investment by the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and M&T assumed another $482 million in TARP obligations from its acquisitions.[20] In 2011, the bank repaid $700 million of TARP funds.[20]
Legal issues[edit]
Money laundering[edit]
In June 2014, a U.S. District Judge ordered M&T Bank to forfeit $560,000 in drug proceeds that was laundered through its Perry Hall, Maryland, branch. At least eight times from 2011 to 2013, Deanna Bailey, a drug dealer,[21] went to the branch and had head teller Sabrina Fitts convert cash — amounts from $20,000 to $100,000 — into larger bills. Fitts accepted a 1 percent transaction fee in exchange for not filing a Currency Transaction Report. This violated the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 which requires all transactions of more than $10,000 to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.[22]
M&T Bank's acquisition of Hudson City Bancorp was held up for more than three years by the Federal Reserve Board, which was unconvinced that the bank's anti-laundering controls were strong enough.[23][24]

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.

Sample Case Study
Learn more about how Enhance contributed to the success of our clients products.


 



Hot Buns™ | Hair Accessory
 
 
 


 

The Challenge
When Taylor Baldwin noticed a growing fad on YouTube of creating fuller hair buns using tube socks, she knew there was an untapped market that girls and women alike would love.
As a successful entrepreneur working as an on-air host and pitch woman in the as seen on TV industry, she began exploring solutions that would work and wanted to introduce the product in a commercial she would produce.
But how do you develop and configure a product with the features and benefits that would appeal to a broad market?
 
 
 


The Solution
It was at the Housewares Show when we initially sat down with her to explore her concept. Within a week our designers ordered nearly every hair product being sold on the market, getting immersed in the industry and testing what worked (and what didn’t) on the female staff members in our office.
Then, working in concert with Ms. Baldwin, our designers sketched numerous solutions and began crude prototyping to test the various ways the product could be constructed.  Finally, Taylor and our designers were able to select the best embodiment to be sold on television and Enhance completed prototyping to be used in the commercial test.
The good news is the product has been a hit, and we are delighted to be a part of making this product a success!
