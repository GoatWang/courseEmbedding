Upon the cessation of our LCM manufacturing business in April 2014, we have formally transformed our core business from the EMS industry to property development and management. We are thoroughly focusing our efforts on redeveloping two parcels of land in Gushu, Shenzhen, and Guangming, Shenzhen, respectively, by converting these two parcels of land into high-end commerical complexes. Subsequently, we believe our principal income will be derived from the rental income from the commercial complexes.

TECHNOLOGIES



 We utilize advanced technologies in the manufacturing of our products. To satisfy the needs of our OEM customers we stay abreast of advancements in technology, upgrading the technologies used in production to maximize flexibility in product design, increase quality levels, and minimize production costs.
CHIP ON FILM, OR COF, is an assembly method for bonding integrated circuit chips and other components onto a flexible printed circuit. This process allows for greater compression of the size of a product when assembled enabling the production and miniaturization of small form factor devices like cellular phones, PDAs, digital cameras and notebook PCs. As of December 31, 2007, we had 16 COF machines. These machines connect the bump of large scale integrated, or LSI, driver onto FPC pattern with anisotropic conductive film, or ACF. These COF machines have the ability to pitch fine to 38 micrometers and a total production capacity of up to 4,400,000 chips per month.
CHIP ON GLASS, OR COG, is a process that connects integrated circuits directly to LCD panels without the need for wire bonding. We apply this technology to produce advanced LCD modules for high-end electronic products, such as cellular phones and PDAs. As of December 31, 2007, we had 23 COG lines in our principal manufacturing facilities. These machines provide an LCD of dimension of up to 200 millimeters (length) x 150 (width) x 2.2 (height), a process time of five seconds per chip, a pin pitch fine to 38 micrometers and a total production capacity of up to 4,200,000 chips per month. During 2005, our subsidiary, Jetup, also started manufacturing COG LCD modules. As of December 31, 2007, Jetup had nine COG lines and is capable of bonding 5 million units of COG LCD modules a month. They are able to bond LCD panels up to sizes of 200 millimeters x 200 millimeters x 2.2 millimeters thick, with an accuracy of five microns’ tolerance, in a cycle time of 12-15 seconds per piece.
CHIP ON BOARD, OR COB, is a technology that utilizes wire bonding to connect large-scale integrated circuits directly to printed circuit boards. As of December 31, 2007, we had 53 COB aluminum bonding machines which provide a high speed chip bonding time of 0.25 second per 2 millimeters wire, a bond pad fine to 75 micrometers and a total production capacity of up to 3,829,000 (150 wires/board) per month. We use COB aluminum bonding in the assembly of consumer products such as digital pen, calculators, electronic dictionaries and audio products. We also had three COB gold ball bonding machines which provide a high speed chip bonding time of 0.072 second per 2 millimeters wire, a bond pad fine to 50 micrometers and a total production capacity of up to 500,000 (150 wires/board) per month. We use COB gold ball bonding in the CMOS camera module, which use in USB camera, notebook computer, mobile phone and digital pen.
OUTER LEAD BONDING, OR OLB, is an advanced technology used to connect PCBs and large-scale integrated circuits with a large number of connectors. We use this technology to manufacture complex miniaturized products, such as high-memory PDAs. As of December 31, 2007, we had three OLB machines. The machines include multi-pinned tape carrier packaged large scale integrated circuit, or TCP LSIC, bonding which is up to 280 pins, which also provide ultra thin assembly with module thickness to around one millimeter and high accuracy bonding with pin pitch to 100 micrometers. The total production capacity is 12,000 units per month. 
TAPE AUTOMATED BONDING WITH ANISOTROPIC CONDUCTIVE FILM, OR TAB WITH ACF, is an advanced heat sealing technology that connects a liquid crystal display component with an integrated circuit in very small LCD modules, such as those used in cellular phones and pagers. As of December 31, 2007, we had 24 systems of TAB with ACF machines. The machines provide process time of 10 to 25 seconds per component, a pin pitch fine to 150 micrometers and a total production capacity of up to 4,936,000 components per month. During 2005, Jetup also started manufacturing TAB LCD modules. As of December 31, 2007, Jetup had four TAB lines and is capable of bonding 2,000,000 pieces of TAB LCD modules a month. They are able to bond LCD panels up to sizes of 120 millimeters x 120 millimeters x 2.2 millimeters thick, with an accuracy of 10 microns’ tolerance in a cycle time of 20-25 seconds per piece.
FINE PITCH HEAT SEAL TECHNOLOGY, OR FPHS TECHNOLOGY, allows us to connect LCD displays to PCBs produced by COB and outer lead bonding that enables very thin connections. This method is highly specialized and is used in the production of finished products such as PDAs. As of December 31, 2007, we had eight machines utilizing FPHS technology. The machines provide a pin pitch fine to 260 micrometers and a total production capacity of up to 268,000 units per month.
SURFACE MOUNT TECHNOLOGY, OR SMT, is a process by which electronic components are mounted directly on both sides of a printed circuit board, increasing board capacity, facilitating product miniaturization and enabling advanced automation of production. We use SMT for products such as electronic linguistic devices. As of December 31, 2007, we had 37 SMT productions lines. The production time per chip ranges from 0.055 second per chip to 0.8 second per chip and high precision ranging from +/-0.05 millimeter to +/-0.1 millimeter. The components size ranges from 0.4 millimeter (length) x 0.2 millimeter (width) to 55 millimeters (length) x 55 millimeters (width). Ball grid array, or BGA, ball pitch is 0.4 millimeter and ball diameter is 0.2 millimeter. Flip Chip, our smallest lead/bump pitch, is 250/240UM and out smallest components spacing is 0.15 micrometers. The total production capacity is over 1 billion resistor capacitor chips per month.
SUPER-TWISTED NEMATIC LCDS, OR STN DISPLAYS, is a type of monochrome passive matrix LCD capable of providing higher information content display systems and are typically found in applications such as cordless phones, mobile phones, MP3 players, pocket games and PDAs. Our Jetup began producing STN LCDs in 2002. During 2005, Jetup upgraded its two existing twisted nematic, or TN type, LCD lines to STN LCD lines. TN displays rotate the director of the liquid crystal by 90°, but STN LCD displays employ up to a 270° rotation. This extra rotation gives the crystal a much steeper voltage-brightness response curve and also widens the agnle at which the display can be viewed before losing much contrast. As of December 31 2007, Jetup was using three automated STN lines capable of producing both TN and STN type LCDs with capacity of 150,000 pairs of glass (each sheet of glass of 360 millimeters x 400 millimeters size) panels per month.
LCD BACK-END is a main manufacturing process for LCD panels, and is regarded as part of the process for its finished product LCD modules. It includes the precise pure water cleaning process, scribing of LCD glass, liquid crystal insertion, sealing process and breaking process, then turns the LCD mother glass into LCD panels. Our machines can cope with 0.2 millimeters + 0.2 millimeters LCD mother glass up to dimension 550 millimeters x 670 millimeters, with cutting tolerance +/-0.1 millimeters. Nam Tai started mass production from September 2006, with monthly maximum production capacity of 1,800,000 units.
As of December 31, 2007, we had eight clean rooms at our principal manufacturing facilities, which housed COB, COF and COG and Chip Scale Package capabilities for CMOS sensor modules, electronic calculators, digital camera accessories, LCD modules manufacturing. At the same date, we also have four clean rooms at another of our factories, which we use to manufacture LCD panels and modules.
A cleanroom is an environment, typically used in manufacturing or scientific research, which has a low level of environmental pollutants such as dust, airborne microbes, aerosol particles and chemical vapors. In other words, a cleanroom has a controlled level of contamination that is specified by the number of particles per cubic meter at a specified particle size. Of our 12 clean rooms at December 31, 2007, four were class ten thousand, six were class thousand and two were class one hundred with one of them use for cleaning the clothes to be used in clean room.

PRINCIPAL PROPERTY
Our principal property is located in the Bao’An District of Shenzhen. In December 1993, we acquired a 50-year lease for the land. The major project in Shenzhen is the redevelopment of the Company’s raw land in Guangming Hi-Tech Industrial Park, approximately 30 minutes from Nam Tai’s existing property in Shenzhen and approximately one hour driving distance from Hong Kong. We acquired the land use rights to approximately 1.3 million square feet of land in 2005. In light of the announcement by the Shenzhen government of a City Rezoning Project to redevelop the entire area containing the Company’s existing Shenzhen property into a High-end Commercial district, we are focusing our efforts on redevelopment of the land at the earliest practical time.

The Wuxi site is located on a parcel of approximately 470,000 square feet of land.
When we acquired the land use rights in Wuxi, we also acquired similar rights to a second parcel of approximately 515,000 square feet of raw land situated approximately three miles from the first parcel. In September 2010, we sold the second Wuxi parcel back to the Wuxi local government for approximately $1.6 million, realizing a gain of approximately $0.8 million on the second parcel.
The Wuxi project involves our acquisition of the land use rights to raw land adjacent to our parcel of land in Wuxi.  On July 2, 2012 we announced that we recently entered into an agreement with the local government of Wuxi to a purchase of a parcel of land or approximately 470,000 square feet.

Nam Tai Property Inc. (NYSE:NTP)Historical Stock Chart
2 Months : From May 2017 to Jul 2017



SHENZHEN, China, June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nam Tai Property Inc. ("Nam Tai" or the "Company") (NYSE Symbol: NTP) today announced that the latest Project Valuation reports on the projects of "Inno Park" and "Inno City" in Shenzhen made by i) Savills Real Estate Valuation (Guangzhou) Limited on June 1, 2017; ii) Jones Lang LaSalle Corporate Appraisal and Advisory Limited on June 1, 2017; and iii) Cushman & Wakefield on June 9, 2017 have been uploaded to the Company's website. Please note that the evaluation is based on many assumptions, including the assumption that the properties to be constructed are all held for long-term leasing. Information contained in the three reports is for investors' reference only. The Company has not audited these reports and makes no representation as to the accuracy of the reports or the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the reports.
For the reports, please see http://www.namtai.com/investors#investors/real_estates 
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OUR SHARE PRICE TO DECLINE 
Certain statements included in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as "may", "will", "expect", "intend", "estimate", "anticipate", "plan", "seek" or "believe". These forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, may include projections of our future financial performance based on our growth strategies and anticipated trends in our business. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations about future events. There are important factors that could cause our actual results, level of activity, performance, or achievements to differ materially from the results, level of activities, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, delay in the Company's ability to obtain all requisite permits and approvals from relevant government authorities in relation to the redevelopment of two parcels of properties in Gushu, Shenzhen, and Guangming, Shenzhen, respectively, and the successful redevelopment of these properties; the sufficiency of the Company's cash position and other sources of liquidity to fund its property developments; continued inflation and appreciation of the Renminbi against the US dollar; rising labor costs in China and changes in the labor supply and labor relations. In particular, you should consider the risks outlined under the heading "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F and in our Current Reports filed from time to time on Form 6-K. The Company's decision to continue dividend payments in 2017 does not necessarily mean that dividend payments will continue thereafter. Whether future dividends will be declared depend upon the Company's future growth and earnings, of which there can be no assurance, as well as the Company's cash flow needs for further expansion. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that cash dividends on the Company's ordinary shares will be declared beyond those already declared for 2017, what amount that dividends may be or whether such dividends, once declared for a specific period, will continue for any future period, or at all. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance, or achievements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this press release and; as such, they should not be unduly relied upon as circumstances change. Except as required by law, we are not obligated, and we undertake no obligation, to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements that might reflect events or circumstance occurring after the date of this release or those that might reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
ABOUT NAM TAI PROPERTY INC.
We are a real estate developer. We hold two parcels of land located in Gushu and Guangming, Shenzhen, China. We are converting these two parcels of land that formally housed the manufacturing facilities of our prior businesses into high-end commercial complexes. We expect our principal income in the future will be derived from rental income from these commercial complexes. 
Nam Tai Property Inc. is a corporation registered in the British Virgin Islands and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (Symbol: "NTP").
Please refer to the Nam Tai website (www.namtai.com) or the SEC website (www.sec.gov) for Nam Tai press releases and financial statements.
