Modern Slavery Statement

Due to the scope of our business The Staffing Group recognises that we may be at risk of Modern Slavery (slavery, servitude, forced labour and human trafficking).  The following statement has been published in accordance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and sets out the steps taken by The Staffing Group during the year end of December 2017 to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in its businesses and supply chains.
Our Business
The Staffing Group is a privately owned limited company compromising of four subsidiary companies; Single Resource Limited, Extra Personnel Limited, Extra Personnel Limited t/a ep professional and Extra Personnel Automotive Limited.
Single Resource Limited offer bespoke onsite managed services to the warehousing, distribution, logistics, food manufacturing, technology and airside sectors within the UK.
Extra Personnel Limited is a specialist provider of Industrial, Transport, Commercial, Automotive and Skilled & Technical recruitment across the Midlands, Central and North West England.
Extra Personnel Limited t/a ep professional offer temporary, permanent, interim and contract solutions across the UK.
Extra Personnel Automotive Limited provide onsite managed services, remote and branch lead recruitment models for multiple site locations across the UK within the automotive sector.
As a group we are committed to working alongside any organisation which will support in the overall aim of reducing modern slavery within our supply chain and across the UK.
Policies and Procedures
We will not tolerate or condone any form of exploitation and as such, have implemented a Preventing Hidden Labour Exploitation Policy.  This sets out the responsibilities of each individual within the business to identify and report any suspicions of potential cases of exploitation.  All reports will be fully investigated and appropriate remedial actions taken.
Procedures have been put in place to support internal employees in identifying potential hidden labour exploitation.
Policies and procedures are developed by the Compliance Department alongside the relevant subject matter expert, and signed off at Director level.
Due Diligence and audits
We understand that our biggest exposure to Modern Slavery is within the recruitment process and undertake to raise awareness within the business in order to identify any potential situations from the first instance.
Due diligence is expected throughout the whole recruitment process and throughout the workers employment within the business.  Reports are monitored to identify houses of multiple occupancy, with welfare meetings held as an additional check to highlight “Alert Flags” of exploitation.
All sites / branches and 2nd tier suppliers are subject to due diligence checks in the form of compliance audits conducted by the Compliance Department.
These audits assess compliance with the relevant legislation / regulations and are, amongst other things, intended to identify any Modern Slavery practices or areas of potential risk.  Procedures are reviewed to eliminate risk and gain compliance across all business locations.
Training and Awareness
All new internal employees are invited to attend a company induction which will provide information on the business, our values, policies and procedures and information on Modern Slavery.
Workshops are rolled out across the business in order to upskill our current internal employees or offer further support where required.
All attendees to either induction or workshops will be asked to commit to preventing labour exploitation by signing a “Recruiter Compliance Principles” document which is retained on their personal file.
Flexi-Workers are shown the Stronger Together “Daniel and Weronika” video, along with leaflets and posters available to highlight the situation and how the individual can report their suspicions.
The “Lured by a job, trapped in forced labour” video from the International Labour Organisation is shown in reception areas to highlight the situation and notify applicants that we do not tolerate any form of exploitation.
Attendance to roadshows and workshops provided by external companies such as the Association of Labour Providers is promoted to all top level management in order to maintain knowledge and distribute across the business.
The business have also conducted an awareness event during Anti-Slavery Week which saw members of the business situated within the Mander Centre, Wolverhampton, alongside a “Gift Box” which aims to raise awareness of forced labour with over 1000 leaflets distributed to the local community.
Posters have been distributed to sites/ branches regards a reporting app named “Hollie Guard” which enables potential victims the ability alert friends or family should they need help.
In order to ensure any potential victims of exploitation are dealt with in the correct manner and any investigations are conducted effectively without damaging evidence, key members of the business have achieved a Certificate in Professional Development for Investigating Modern Slavery.  This course has been developed by the GLA in conjunction with Derby University and provides guidance on how to conduct an investigation effectively whilst protecting potential victims.
Overview
The Staffing Group commit to ensuring we operate towards the best practices at all times.  Evidence of this can be seen through the Stronger Together website, which shows we have taken the relevant steps to become a Business Partner of Stronger Together since 2015.
By implementing and continually reviewing checks which minimise the risk of any form of modern slavery taking place within our operations, we are able to support the relevant government authorities in reporting any identified situations, and as such protect our business, our clients businesses and first and foremost, our workers.
