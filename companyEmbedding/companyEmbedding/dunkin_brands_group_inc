Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Dunkin' Brands' Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at the appropriate time. As a reminder, this conference may be recorded.
I would now like to turn today's conference over to Stacey Caravella. You may begin.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Speaking on today's call will be Dunkin' Brands' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nigel Travis; President of Dunkin' Donuts, U.S. and Canada, Dave Hoffmann; and Dunkin' Brands' Chief Financial Officer, Kate Jaspon.
Today's call is being webcast live and recorded for a replay. Before I turn the call over to Nigel, I'd like to remind everyone that the language on forward-looking statements included in our earnings release also applies to our comments made during the call. Our release can be found on our website, investor.dunkinbrands.com, along with any reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on the call with their corresponding GAAP measures.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Nigel.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Stacey, thank you, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call to discuss our second quarter 2017 results. With nearly 9,000 Dunkin' Donuts restaurants in the U.S., greater than $8 billion in systemwide Dunkin' Donuts U.S. sales in 2016, and are positioned as the number one seller of hot and iced coffee, donuts and bagels. We're a brand that can win and is winning. In fact last year, Dunkin' Donuts U.S. systemwide sales grew by greater than $600 million, a number only exceeded by two other brands. This is according to Nation's Restaurant News Top 100 chain results survey.
For the consumer's needs, the expectations are shifting and that is why we invested significantly in consumer research last year, so that we could position ourselves to address the change in marketplace. We are very excited about the progress that we have made on our multi-year plan to transform Dunkin' Donuts U.S. into a beverage-led, On-the-Go brand. Together with our franchisees, we're laser focused on delivering what matters most to consumers, including menu innovation, unparallel convenience driven by digital leadership, restaurant excellence and simplification and broad accessibility to our products through strategic restaurant development and the sale of our products in other channels. As evidence of our progress, we will be expanding our menu simplification test to 1,000 locations by October of this year, and Dave will cover that later.
Before I go to our quarterly results, I'd like to address some recent management changes. Firstly, I'd like to congratulate Kate on being named our CFO. She seamlessly stepped into the role on an interim basis, and we were delighted to officially offer her the position at the end of May. Kate, congratulations. We've also made some changes in our marketing department, Chris Fuqua, who many of you know, he is our newly named Senior Vice President Operations Strategy and Supply Chain for Dunkin' Donuts U.S. reporting today. Chris played an instrumental role in resetting the Dunkin' Donuts brand and now he's moving on to a new role to gain more general management experience.

Scott Hudler, our former Chief Digital Officer, left the company at the end of June, and as a result of his departure, and Chris's transition, we're recruiting for a new Chief Marketing Officer. In the interim, Chris continues to oversee marketing and is available today to answer your questions. I'm also pleased to announce that Sherrill Kaplan, Vice President of Digital Marketing and Innovation, will oversee all aspects of our digital initiatives for Dunkin'. Sherrill is also available today to answer your questions.
We're also happy to announce the promotion of Jason Maceda, as the new Senior Vice President of Baskin-Robbins, U.S. and Canada. He is a 19-year Dunkin' Brands veteran and most recently served as our Vice President of U.S. Financial Planning and Corporate Real Estate. He succeeds Weldon Spangler who left the company in June to become a CEO at another company. Now, Jason isn't a traditional finance executive, anyone who knows him will tell you that. For many years in addition to his financial role, he has been actively involved in the day-to-day operations of the restaurants for both Dunkin' and Baskin. He is well suited for his new position and will help us capitalize on the solid growth opportunities for Baskin-Robbins in the U.S. and Canada.
These changes represent our commitment to people by developing talent within Dunkin' Brands to build for the future. I believe we have a nice balance of established leaders and people who have been internally groomed through our succession process and leaders like Dave who have come from outside of the company. I'm proud of and energized by how the organization has handled our recent leadership changes.
Now, back to our second quarter results, I'll let Dave cover Dunkin' U.S. comps, but our 0.8% comps for the quarter was an encouraging improvement over the first quarter. I'd like now to revisit a topic that I addressed on the first quarter earnings call and that's our franchisees' commitment to Dunkin' Donuts brand. Over the past two years, our Dunkin' Donuts U.S. franchisees have invested more than $1 billion in their restaurants. And they continue to open more net new stores than almost any other brand in the QSR space, which has led to top tier systemwide sales increases year by year.
Additionally as you know from time to time, we offer our franchisees the opportunity to renew the term remaining on their franchise agreements to get them back to 20 years. That's, of course, assuming they are up-to-date with their remodel schedule. We opened this opportunity earlier this year and our franchisees have responded so positively to it that they have well exceeded our expectations year-to-date for renewals of their agreements.
As a matter of fact, at the end of Q2, nearly 75% of all Dunkin' Donuts restaurants had greater than 10 years remaining on their franchise agreements. This constancy in our franchise base is a major contributor to the consistent results that our 100% franchise business model delivers. Obviously, this level of term renewal is great news financially, but more importantly, it's a sign of our franchisees' long-term commitment to the brand. They continue to demonstrate that they want to put their money back into Dunkin' Donuts and indeed are pushing to extend their contracts on a concerted basis. Which brings me to our updated development guidance that we provided in our press release earlier today. We now are expecting Dunkin' Donuts U.S. franchisees to open between 330 and 350 net new restaurants this year. Previously, we expected them to open approximately 385.
So let me discuss why we are doing this. Firstly, we're underway on the design of our next Dunkin' Donuts restaurant image. And we plan to have beta locations in market later this year and have it ready to begin a national launch in the second half of 2018. We believe this new design will be transformational from a design, equipment and technology perspective, and we want our franchisees to have the capital to build the greatest number of restaurants in the new image over the next few years. Secondly, our franchisees have significant numbers of renewals coming due in the couple of years and we want them to be able to convert as many of these as possible to the new look.

With these factors in mind, we recently sat down with a group of leadership franchisees to walk them through all the work that's been done to evolve the Dunkin' Donuts brand and the planned timing of the new image. We discussed the most effective use of that capital over the next few years so that we can strike the right balance between driving smart growth and ensuring the current store base reflects our new image, which we believe will bring even stronger returns to our franchisees and to Dunkin' Brands. As a result of this, we're revising our expected net openings for 2017. I truly believe, it's a testament to our ongoing focus on franchisee relationships and franchisee profitability that we're having this strategic conversation with our franchisees and that we're aligned as a system to ensure continued quality growth across the U.S. and the long-term relevance and sustainability of the Dunkin' Donuts brand.
I want to be clear. This does not mean that all new restaurants and remodels that our franchisees complete in 2018 will be in the new design. We're also working through plans on how, and when to make it available to franchisees, particularly for remodels. And once we release the new design, franchisees will begin incorporating it into their development plans, but we are laying the groundwork now to ensure that they can build and convert the greatest number of restaurants to the new image over the next few years. I also want to emphasize very clearly that we're not changing 2017 guidance for revenue, operating income or earnings per share.
A couple of more things I'd like to share in regards to Dunkin' Donuts U.S. restaurant growth. First, our franchisees have opened more than 1,800 net new stores from 2012 to 2016, and have added nearly $2 billion in new first year sales to our Dunkin' Donuts U.S. system. Going forward, systemwide sales growth is a number we will likely focus on in our discussions with you, as this metric really demonstrates organic growth of our business and the quality of our net new restaurant developments.
And additionally, we are pleased to announce that the 2015 cohort of traditional new stores in the west and emerging regions finished at approximately 20% cash-on-cash returns. This is truly great news. And as a reminder, the west for us means everything west to the Mississippi, not just California. I agree it's a slightly strange region. Obviously, in an area that contains states as widely diverse as California, Utah, and Louisiana, cash-on-cash returns will vary widely. However, this is the point I think you've been waiting to hear, however, in our most important high opportunity states like California, our franchisees are enjoying higher returns than the average.
In closing, we expect that Dunkin' Donuts U.S. will finish the year yet again, as one of the fastest growing restaurant concepts in the country by both unit count and by increases in systemwide sales.
With that, I'm going to hand it over to my friend Dave, who will cover the Dunkin' Donuts U.S. performance. Dave?
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thanks, Nigel, and hello to everyone on today's call. In the next few minutes, I plan to touch on results and also tease out how we're operationalizing elements of our plan. So, let me begin with results.
In the second quarter, our systemwide sales grew nearly 6% in the U.S. driven by new store growth and comparable store sales. Comparable store sales were 0.8% as ticket growth was offset by traffic declines. Ticket and traffic remained largely the same as Q1 apart from a slight easing in traffic declines. From a day-part perspective, we are encouraged by our morning comp growth as it outpaced our reported full day comp growth. Price held steady, while weather was a slight headwind in the quarter particularly in the month of May, which was unseasonably cool and wet in our core markets.

Now from a category standpoint, breakfast sandwich sales were strong, driven by Wake-up Wraps and core sandwiches as well as through innovative offerings like our Pretzel Croissant Breakfast Sandwich. And on the beverage side, iced coffee sales continued to grow as a result of our Cold Brew platform. The iced tea category was also up, driven by the launch of Fruited Iced Tea. And while we had a very successful launch of Frozen Dunkin' Coffee, which is a strong addition to our beverage lineup, you'll continue to see us build that out and that platform out through the addition of flavors such as the recently introduced S'mores. Going forward, we continue to expect low single-digit comparable store sales growth for Dunkin' U.S. for the remainder of 2017.
We've talked extensively in the past about our six-part strategic plan to transform Dunkin' into a beverage-led, On-the-Go brand. Now, we are bringing that plan to life at the restaurant level. As we operationalize this plan, let me take you through the progress to-date and the sequencing going forward. It's worth noting that we built this plan with our franchisee leadership. And it speaks to our alignment and laser-focus to drive our future together.
Looking first at menu, for the balance of 2017 we will have a maniacal focus on our core strengths. First and foremost, extending our coffee leadership in the category through products like our newly launched Frozen Coffee platform to the highly successful ready-to-drink coffee line with Coca-Cola, as well as advertising that speaks to our unmatched quality. The recent campaign This is Coffee highlights why we are number one in the hot drip coffee market.
Second, we'll continue to focus on donuts. This is a category in which we have significant equity as the number one retailer nationally. And given our scale, we have an ability to offer fun and innovative products at a great value as compared to the boutique players in this space. The recent Cake Batter Donut and current S'mores Donuts are great examples of this. And you'll continue to see us double down on our donut mojo in the back half of 2017.
And finally, we'll focus on delivering a compelling, national value message, such as the two for $2 Wake-up Wrap offer that's underway now. And it's important to note that while we have had regional value offerings in the past, the focus on national value is relatively new to us and underscores the alignment and unity that we have with our franchisees behind the plan.
Now I'd like to provide an update on our menu simplification efforts. And while it may sound counter-intuitive, a key underpinning of menu innovation – again a key underpinning of menu innovation is menu simplification, which enables us to take complexities that have crept into the restaurants over the last several years out of the system.
Menu simplification is all about creating room for growth for the next wave of innovation as a beverage-led, On-the-Go brand. As you know we introduced a simplified menu into 300 restaurants earlier this year and are very pleased with the results. And as Nigel mentioned upfront, we will be expanding the streamlined menu to an additional 700 restaurants by October for a total of 1,000 locations. We will roll it out in two phases, the first by the end of August and the second by October. Providence, Rhode Island, a major market for us, will be included in the first wave in August.
I know that there is significant interest in the number of SKUs being eliminated and the percentage of the menu that has been removed. At this point it's still premature for us to share specifics, but we can assure you that classics like the bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant are staying on the menu.
Some examples of things that have been removed are afternoon sandwiches, a few muffin and bagel varieties, and some bakery items like danishes and cookies. We will continue to tweak the simplified menu using feedback from customers, franchisees, and employees as we move into the next phase going forward.

However, we still believe that benefits of the simplified menu in the long run will help drive top line and bottom line from improved customer throughput, happier crew and managers, and ultimately increased restaurant level margins. As we've said before, simplification will continue to be a cultural mindset for our system. We want to make our restaurant simpler and easier to operate. In addition to this, we are also working on an updated POS system design to make life easier at the store level as well.
Besides menu, the next strategic aspect of the plan is to offer our customers unparalleled convenience that sets us apart from any other concept in the category. We know from our research that guests use us as an On-the-Go brand. So making ourselves increasingly more convenient for consumers is an essential part of who we are and who we want to be. Our goal is to be agnostic as to how our guests use Dunkin', essentially allowing them to order how they want, pay how they want, and get the beverages and food the way they want.
Taste and quality are still king for us, but we also want to offer a frictionless experience for our guests. Bringing about this transformation demands that we look at every aspect of our restaurant operations and our store design, including the drive-thru. In fact, going forward we expect to see an even greater percentage of Dunkin' restaurants opening with drive-thrus. In 2017 we anticipate that approximately 85% of our traditional store openings will have a drive-thru, compared to only 70% five years ago. This increased emphasis on drive-thrus is a big part of our strategy to be an On-the-Go brand, and we want to make the Dunkin' drive-thru experience the best in the industry.
In addition to unparalleled convenience, this also relies very heavily on new uses of technology. Key to this is our Perks loyalty program, and today, we sit at nearly 7 million members. DD Perks makes our members feel valued and appreciated via offers, rewards and access to On-the-Go mobile ordering. And in return, we receive rich customer data that we can leverage to drive one-to-one marketing and incremental sales. Quality of the user experience is a constant focus for us. And as we approach the five star ratings in both the [iTunes] App Store and Google Play, we believe this is how today's guests want to interact with their favorite brands.
Additionally, under the headline of differentiating ourselves through unparalleled convenience, we're pleased to announce that we are now making curbside delivery an option for all of our franchisees. Curbside will provide DD Perks guests the option of having their orders brought right to their cars, and gives us one more avenue to build on with our super convenience strategy. Worth noting we are also expanding our delivery program to the Miami market this month via our partnership with DoorDash, and coming later this year, we will be piloting a catering test on our newly designed website dunkindonuts.com. Catering is not new to us as many franchisees have been providing the service for years. However, what will be new is the online catering feature, and a more unified approach across the system.
Part three of our strategic plan is to give consumers increased accessibility to our brand. And that's going to be through the addition of new restaurants, through partnerships like our agreement with Amtrak to serve our hot coffee on the Acela Express, high-speed trains, and also through branded consumer products offered outside our restaurants such as what I recently mentioned, the new ready-to-drink iced coffees in partnership with Coca-Cola. And in fact, we're very pleased with the early progress of this product as we just did double-digits on market share. As for new unit growth in Q2, Dunkin' U.S. franchisees opened 64 net new restaurants versus 73 net new units last year. Our franchisees also completed a 114 remodels during the quarter.

Okay, finally the fourth element of our plan is restaurant excellence. Our franchisees take a lot of pride in running great restaurants. But we all know that you're only as good as your last visit. That said, we believe structural initiatives such as the simplified menu will help our franchisees reduce labor turnover, a major concern in the state labor market obviously, and allow them to focus on the basics of fast, accurate and friendly service. As you can hear, we are well underway with our multi-year plan to transform Dunkin' into a beverage-led, On-the-Go brand. We've a lot of heavy lifting still to do, but I am confident in our U.S. blueprint for growth, focused on menu innovation, unparalleled convenience, broad accessibility, and restaurant excellence. Then you wrap all of this with a more modern and relevant brand expression including new restaurant designs that Nigel talked about and we're confident that this plan will put our system on the next wave of long-term sustainable growth.
In closing, I am energized by the alignment of our great franchisees and brand employees alike. Together, we are committed to growing Dunkin' in a smart, responsible way to ensure the continued relevancy of the brand, and I look forward to sharing and most importantly showing you more about our brand evolution at our Investor and Analyst Day, which we'll be hosting in Boston this February 2018. So stay tuned for more details on that.
So with that, I will now turn the call back over to Nigel to go through our Baskin-Robbins U.S. and International results. Nigel?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thanks, Dave. Baskin-Robbins U.S. restaurant store sales were negative during the second quarter driven by a decline in traffic, offset by increased average ticket. We were excited to announce the launch of home delivery following on the trend that Dave talked about of home delivery through our partner DoorDash, which rolled out on June 30. Now more than 600 Baskin-Robbins locations in 22 cities will be supported by DoorDash delivery, including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York City and San Francisco. Given that we're experiencing comparable store sales declines two quarters into the year, we are revising our full year 2017 target for Baskin-Robbins U.S. to slightly negative comparable store sales.
Now to International, Baskin-Robbins International had a strong quarter from a comparable store sales point of view. The focus on value and trade up programs were particularly impactful in the key markets of Japan and Korea. Restaurant growth was driven by the Middle East and Korea.
Dunkin' Donuts International continues to be in stabilization mode with Dunkin' Korea being responsible for the majority of store closings in the second quarter for the segment. They're conducting a review of their restaurant portfolio and closing older unprofitable locations. As a result, they informed us that they will be closing more locations than they previously expected. Therefore, we now expect international franchisees and licensees to open between 50 and 100 net new restaurants outside of the U.S. in 2017.
I'm passing on now to Kate Jaspon.
Kate Jaspon - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thank you, Nigel. Revenue for the second quarter increased approximately $2 million or 1% compared to the prior year period, due primarily to increased royalty income as well as an increase in rental income. The increase was offset by a decrease of sales in company-operated restaurants. As a reminder, we sold all of our company-owned restaurants in fiscal 2016. Also, offsetting the increase in revenue was a decrease in sales of ice cream, primarily through our licensees in the Middle East as well as a decrease in other revenues.
Operating income and adjusted operating income for the second quarter increased $7.4 million or 7% and $7.6 million or nearly 7% respectively from the prior year. These increases were primarily the result of increase in royalty income and increase in rental margins, and a decrease in our general and administrative expenses. The second quarter decrease in G&A reflects our ongoing focus on being diligent around our expense. The increases in operating income and adjusted operating income were offset by a $2.1 million gain recognized in connection with the sale of our company-operated restaurants in the second quarter of the prior year, as well as a decrease in other revenues.

Net income and adjusted net income for the second quarter each increased by approximately $6 million or 12% compared to the prior-year period, primarily as a result of the increases in operating income and adjusted operating income offset by an increase in income tax expense. Diluted earnings per share and diluted adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter increased by approximately 11% to $0.60 per share and 12% to $0.64 per share respectively, compared to the prior-year period as a result of the increases in net income and adjusted net income respectively, offset by an increase in shares outstanding.
The increase in shares outstanding from the prior-year period was primarily due to the exercise of stock options and the new accounting standard adopted in the first quarter of 2017, offset by the repurchases of shares since our second quarter of fiscal 2016. Excluding the impact of excess tax benefits recognized, diluted earnings per share and diluted adjusted earnings per share would have been approximately $0.01 lower for the quarter. At the end of the second quarter, we had a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.6:1. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.5%.
During the quarter, we generated approximately $78 million in free cash flow, and ended the quarter with $340 million of cash and short-term restricted cash on the balance sheet. Of that $340 million, $124 million represents cash associated with our gift card programs and the marketing fund balances. We used approximately $29 million of cash during the quarter to pay our Q2 cash dividend to our shareholders. During the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average cost per share of $56.90 under the $100 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that we entered into May. This accelerated share repurchase essentially offsets any dilution that we expect for 2017 from the exercise of options, and therefore, was contemplated in our original 2017 EPS guidance.
In closing, I think it's important to once again highlight that despite revising certain store development expectations for the year, we are maintaining our revenue growth, operating income growth and earnings per share targets for fiscal 2017.
With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of John Glass with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks very much. First, just on the reduction in the store growth for this year, Nigel, do you think this is the right run rate to think of the Dunkin' growth in future years or is this a half step as you think about more investment needs in the core business for the existing stores, so that it may slow further as that process unfolds?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. So, John, thank you for the question. Good morning. What I'd say is that we always regard our ourselves as a truly strong development company. I outlined some of the statistics. This was a guide for this year only. We only ever give guidance for the year, we never go beyond the one year. I think our franchisees are excited about our returns. I think they're excited about the new image. They're excited about the transformational plan that Dave has laid over the last several months. So, we'll keep our foot to the ground, the accelerator will go right down and I think 2018, 2019, 2020 and so on will be as high as we can possibly achieve.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
And do you think getting that incremental growth combined with the amount of remodels and some of the technology investments, et cetera, that franchisees are willing to fund that themselves, or do you contemplate at some point as other brands have maybe co-investing in some of these initiatives to make sure that they get done and that franchisees are pleased with the investments they need to make?

Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Very good question. And I think it's something that's historical, certainly in my time, the franchisees have funded it themselves and they've done a great job, so they are a group who really do like investing in their restaurants. I mean, it's always intrigued me that franchisees truly like spending capital. Having said that, I think the transformation is going to be so significant that it's something we'll certainly consider. We've made no decisions. It's something we've actually talked about. We have noted as you point out what other brands have done. Cash is not a problem for us. Cash is something that could be helpful. So, it's something that we will consider, but I want to be absolutely clear, we have made no decisions on investing with our franchisees, so I don't want anyone to go away thinking that I said that we will.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question in queue will come from the line of John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Yes. Hi. Thank you. Two questions, if I may. First, just looking at the menu simplification, just wondering what the learnings were in wave one on those first 300 stores. How wave two might change, just in terms of the overall focus, more units, less units? How it's priced? What have you, any type of operational organization and even going from 1,000 units to 9,000 units is obviously or approximately 9,000 units is a pretty big leap. So, what are you looking for in the completion of that 1,000 unit test to get it in all 9,000 units. And if you wanted to do that, how quickly could that happen?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So, I'm going to pass over to Dave.
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah, thanks, John. Hey, look, Chris is leading this effort for us, so I'm going to have him jump in here as well on this. But we're very pleased with the first 300. Some of those markets don't represent all of our core markets, and so it was important that we be responsible and scale this to the next level, so that's why the next 700 are in place.
But again we are excited about what we see in terms of especially the velocity that we're seeing on the P&L in food cost and then also the feedback that we're getting in terms of crew and manager satisfaction, they're doing hand stands over this and then also one of the biggest things, first and foremost, is customer throughput. And so, across those three dimensions, we're very excited, but we felt like we needed to drop in another wave to make sure we could validate everything, but I'll let Chris touch on anything else there.
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Sure. Thanks, Dave. So, great question John. I think the reality of the operational benefit is being felt by people within our restaurants and you're seeing improvements in food costs, you're seeing an easier labor model to execute and that's probably the biggest challenge that we face with our franchisees together on a regular basis. As we look forward to expanding this, we really want to make sure that the consumer benefits from it as well. So, all of the different things that you have to do within a restaurant to make sure that the consumers understand which products they might switch to if their favorite product is no longer available, we want to make sure that we're clearing room for growth so that the innovation pipeline can really kick in as we clear that room for growth. And that we have products that are easy to execute along the model of what will be remaining – will be part of the blueprint for the future.
So this is a very deliberate process. We went out and did consumer research. We tested in small modules. We expanded to a small set of stores. Now we're going to 1,000 stores. And then we go to the whole system. And our franchisees are 100% behind this.

Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So I think it's worth emphasizing that this is very complicated, very data-driven as you just suggested. But we will probably end up as we always have had with different solutions for different parts of the country. So there is not one size fits all.
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Absolutely. I mean we're trying to become a much more simple brand. But obviously, there will be things that you could do in different parts of the country on a one-off basis. I think the reality is this is all about simplification of the menu. Simplification of everything else that we do in the restaurants as well will be part of the next wave.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And maybe related to that, and Nigel, in your prepared remarks, you talked about like kind of like the next modern wave of Dunkin' stores having completely different design, equipment and technology. Could you focus on the equipment and technology piece? I mean even if you're just seeing distant prototypes or even in a warehouse somewhere, how significant equipment and technology could be to transform both the throughput and the labor model at Dunkin' as it currently exists today?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So we have a very open mind on technology. There's a lot of different formats that are being developed in the restaurant business. We're looking actively at all those, and if we see something that works for Dunkin' we will integrate it. I think we've already transformed our business significantly. And we feel really proud of the fact that we're this On-the-Go brand. I mean look at our drive-thru numbers as Dave referenced. Look at the success of On-the-Go and that is – as I've said probably 500 times – the architecture for the future, because I deliver it (37:10). So, there is a lot of technology that's going to come in.
The opportunity for you guys to see it will happen I think fairly quickly. I'm not going to promise anything yet, but will happen fairly quickly. And Chris, what else can you add to what I said?
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Absolutely. So if you think about menu simplification as the unlock for menu innovation and really making sure that we're delivering a modern relevant menu for our guests in the future, I think equipment and technology help us with the unparalleled convenience aspect that Dave mentioned in his remarks.
So if you think about smart technology in some of our pieces of equipment, and if you think about really extending on our ability to talk about grinding fresh and brewing fresh, and the fact that we put a new cup of coffee out every 18 minutes to our guests, unlike anybody else in the industry; if you look at what we did with the Sandwich Station over the last couple years to make it easier to deliver throughput. Things around the drive-thru and then On-the-Go. This is all about advancing technology across the entire enterprise, so that we can make our guests happy when they come to the restaurants.
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
And John, it's important that under that pillar of unparalleled convenience, when we talk about being agnostic, technology is going to play a critical role so that the customer can order the way they want, pay the way they want and get the food the way they want. That type of friction-less experience is what's going to be underpinned by all of the technology that Nigel and Chris just mentioned. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much. Two questions as well. First one, just on the 2Q, U.S. Dunkin' comp. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks and then the press release the traffic was negative. Seems like that's similar to the past couple of quarters. But directionally Nigel I thought you mentioned that it was – you were pleased with the improvement in the comps. I'm just wondering if you can provide some color on the comp. I just thought there was a comment that the traffic was actually slipped versus the first quarter, yet the comp was stronger. So any color in terms of the components of the comp, maybe the regions of the comp, where it was better or worse with the dayparts would be very helpful. And then I had one follow-up.

David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. Yes, Jeff on that. Just the opposite, traffic was improved. So it wasn't worse, traffic was improved. And in terms of check, relative about the same in terms of the increase there. So less negative on the traffic side and about on par with Q1 on the check side
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And in terms of region or daypart, is there any area that's more challenged?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
No, we don't break down by region or – what I'll say on daypart and I think I've already commented on this on national TV. So we're really, really pleased with the morning. I mean we are excited about what's happening in the morning. And Dave and I everyday talk about how we can improve the PM. So if I had to choose where I'd be really pleased, I'd be pleased if the morning was doing well, which is when you're an on-the-go brand like ours and led by beverages, you want to be strong in the morning. We're strong in the morning. Breakfast continues to grow.
We do have some questions to ask about how we can stimulate the afternoon. We're trying innovation, we're using Perks offers, we're using some selective discounting. It's not just national discounting, it's some regional. So we really are tackling the afternoon. But I'm delighted with the trends both in traffic and comps in the morning.
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. And Jeff, as you know, there is an industry issue with traffic declines and we're not immune to that. But every quarter we're going to continue to make progress in this area. And it's a laser focus for us in terms of driving traffic in the business.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Understood. And then just a follow-up on the Dunkin' U.S. unit commentary, Nigel. I mean I know you don't give 2018 guidance this early on. But more qualitatively, if the franchisees are balancing their CapEx needs, and I think you mentioned the new store model is really not going to be national until the second half of 2018 and then they're all doing remodels in the equipment and technology. It would seem like it's fair to assume that at least as we start 2018, that this type of reduction is appropriate and likely to persist.
Is there any reason why those investments would abate so quickly that 2018 could see a reacceleration? Or are these investments presumably a little bit longer lasting? And it's the right thing to do in the short term?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So, Jeff, that was a very sophisticated way to get me to comment on 2018, which I'm not going to do. What I will do though is to say that our franchisees have stores already in the pipeline for next year. They have stores in the pipeline for 2019, that's the same every year.
We have in-year stores, a lot of those APODs but sometimes in areas like New York, Philadelphia, you can add in-year stores. But the franchisees are making their decisions. The franchisees sometimes decide they want to put stores, ignoring the new image to block out a competitor or to add to their portfolio. There is all kinds of reasons they do it. But I'm not going to make any more commentary about what may happen in 2018.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Understood. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Andy Barish with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC
Hey guys. Just on the unit development is – have you seen an increased level of cannibalization in core markets and is that factoring in or is it more just the strategic brand changes that you highlighted obviously this morning?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. So, Andy, you and I talked about this before. Cannibalization happens every single store you open, that's a reality. If you're a brand new brand and you open your second store, you're cannibalizing the first. So, cannibalization happens all the time, we decided long time ago not to call out cannibalization. If we did we can probably add it to our accounts but we decided because we're a development company we're never going call it out. So, it happens in certain markets. Sometimes it deliberate. Franchisees sometimes had stores that they deliberately cannibalized their own stores to keep out competition or they hear a competition coming in. So, that happens all the time, but we're not going to break it down by region, which is consistently what we do with the rest of our results.

Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC
Okay. And then, one modeling question to get Kate involved here. Obviously, the unit development stuff is negative to the broader guide, but you've kept the numbers intact. I guess, just trying to see what the offset is that's coming in a little bit more positive relative to the slower unit count numbers?
Kate Jaspon - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Sure. Good question. From time to time, we offer our franchisees the option to renew their term on the remaining agreement. I think we mentioned within the script to allow them to get back to 20 years of term assuming they're up-to-date with their remodel schedule. So, this year, franchisees have exceeded our expectations year-to-date for renewals so that's driving it. And then, we have a line of sight into the additional renewals that we expect will come in the back half of the year. So, that's primarily the offset.
Andrew Marc Barish - Jefferies LLC
Okay. Thank you.
Kate Jaspon - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question will come from Gregory Francfort with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey, guys. Can you just talk about the ready-to-drink market, sort of what you're seeing there, and maybe do you think you're expanding that category or taking share from other major competitors. And if so, maybe who do you think you're taking share from sort of the higher-end guys or who else?
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, Greg. You know what, we're really delighted with the partnership that we have with Coca-Cola to get into this space. We think it's incredible white space for us and we did our launch early this year and very pleased, you heard me talk about – we just broke through double digits on national share from the reporting that we're getting back. And Coke is excited about the partnership along with the bottlers as well, as we move forward. In terms of what we're seeing, we're expanding the category. Of course, I'm sure there is going to be – we're going to be taking sure as well, but more broadly, we're expanding the category right now. But we're excited about our initial launch and we're excited about the innovation that we're going to be putting behind that as well going forward.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Got it. And maybe just one other. Just on the changes to the assets and the potential reimage that you're guys are doing. Can you talk about the drive-thru and how that fits into it? With mobile or in-pay (46:49) do you think there is any need to change kind of the layout or set up of the drive-thru going forward?
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah, that's one where we're continue to tackle, look we've got a strong drive-thru presence I think you heard the say same as this before that 55% of our fleet of restaurants have drive-thrus, Curbside is another avenue for us to get into that super convenient market. But in that space, when we talk about a frictionless experience inside we also mean that for the drive-thru as well. And so on-the-go ordering, we're looking at available ways that we might be able to make that even more advantageous for our on-the-go customers. So that is all in play and you'll see iterations of that as we start testing that and looking at things on how we can make that throughput even better and that proposition for the customer even better.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Great. I'll just add one thing in slightly broader. We're so excited about our drive-thru performance in the U.S. I'm really pushing hard to see how we can take drive-thru into international. We do have some international stores, particularly in the Saudi Arabia with drive-thru. I think, we could do more and I'm also intrigued by Baskin-Robbins, where I think, I'll have to check the number, but I think there were 89 stores of drive-thrus and some of them have a very high percentage going through the drive-thru.

I think, Jason, with his leadership will understand how strong drive-thru has been in Dunkin' and migrate at the Baskin. So I think, this – unparallel convenience that Dave talked about is the trend that we can apply elsewhere.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks. Thanks, Nigel.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from Jason West with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah. Thanks, guys. Sorry to go back to the unit outlook again, but obviously, it's pretty critical for the growth model here. So can you talk a bit more about the decision to lower the guidance, I mean, you talked about the new prototype or design that you want to focus on for remodels and new units, but it seems like, there must be more to it in that in terms of why you would lower the number, mid-year here and is this decision coming more from the corporate office saying we think the system should slowdown or is this just adding up sort of the franchisee commitments and the numbers coming in a little bit lower than expected and any other pressures out there that are driving this, whether it's competition or real estate, pick-up and closures? Anymore color would be helpful, thanks.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. So, good question. So, most of the things you put out there I can say no to. The first thing is, someone wrote this morning about is it unit economics? No. We're actually delighted with our unit economics and we've done some internal comparisons which I won't go into in explicit detail today, but we believe we are right up the league table of unit economics when you look at it in several ways particularly when you look at things like food, paper, labor, which we call FPL here, and we're way up there compared with all kinds of other chains.
Secondly, it's not corporate office mandate in. Corporate office works with the franchisees. Most franchisees, as I said earlier, plan well over a year in advance. So you don't just suddenly knee jerk it. I think every year we have in-store deals, some of them are APODs and some of those stores we are not opening to be brutally honest appropriately, they are $1,500 average weekly sales. I mean, there is a mix there. So I'm far less concerned about the new. I think I've given you the reasons which, just to reiterate, is about the new image coming along, the franchisees where they're going to invest their money in the future and I think probably the thing you said was, as we look to that, we decided that we're always transparent with the Street that we'd just be transparent and say our guidance is coming down. You never know right until the end of the year what the number is going to be. Some stores can be opening on the 28th of December, moving to next year or stay in this year. So with all that, we decided to bring down guidance, but none of the things like unit economics were a driver behind this.
Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Okay. And any color on the regional change that's occurred? I know you guys aren't given the regional breakdown until year end now, but in terms of the pull back on some of the units, is it in more of the corn established, I would assume, or maybe not.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. I think there's some pullback there, but I think one number that I always get this number wrong, so I'll get Dave to do it. If I take California we are expecting this year to have over 60% growth in California. Is that right?
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. 60% on the base will be new store growth. So any boutique out there, if you look to this, you'd say that's unbelievable, but on our size and how we're evaluated, it doesn't show up yet as something that significant.

But, again, we are pursuing greater exposure out, West. We've talked to you about that extensively and I'd say, as Nigel pointed out and said earlier during his talking point, say there is normal ebb and flows and as I saw it in my previous role as well, and we are focused on quality and quality openings. And again you heard Nigel talked about first year sales and look there is a lot of excitement and I'm spending a lot of time out on the road with our franchisees and there is a lot of alignment unity behind not only this plan but what we're doing around new growth and remodels going forward.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. I took a look for later making us up-to-date at some of our competitors and their openings and every time I look at it, one change that got a lot fanfare earlier in the week closed 15 stores in the quarter. Look at our numbers, look at our year's numbers. The only chain change has beaten us in the U.S. is Starbucks. So, we're way up there. So, we feel actually very good about what we've continued to do and the great thing is franchisees feel good about their openings – the stores they are opening.
Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC

Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.
David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. I got first a follow-up back there on the unit growth and particularly about the format in the regions, I have a feeling that there is differences in the returns you're getting between California versus other and drive-thru versus inline. So, for instance, drive-thrus in California maybe the answer but those don't get built over night with the zoning that must be out there. The pipeline may take time to build for something like that and therefore the ramp. Could you talk a little bit more about these differences and how the development – this would affect the development, the rate of development? Thanks.
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yes, David, good morning. As you point out, look we're late to California. We have to be a little bit more ingenious on how we go after sites and get into the sites, but that's the brilliance of our model. Drive-thru is going to be core asset for us so that's one piece of this but we also think curbside, also with our inline restaurants is also going to be an element of this that mirrors and very much resembles the returns that we're seeing with drive-thru.
So look on returns, the returns out in California as Nigel said upfront are great. The operators are bullish, and so we're still very much forging ahead, but we're trying to give the franchisees more options and more avenues and more tools in their toolbox to be able to penetrate a market that is heavily penetrated and where we're coming in from behind to make sure that we can get the great sites that are needed out there for long-term success.
David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC
And then also you had talked previously about doing more with advertised value perhaps nationally, advertised value. What have you done so far there, it's hard to tease out what's local versus national and is more of that to come than what we've seen so far? Thanks.
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Thanks, David. This is Chris. So, we have alignment with our franchisees on nationally advertised value every month for the rest of the year, two for $2 Wake-up Wrap is a great example. Every restaurant in our system is offering that as a national promotion currently, and you'll see more of that to come in the months ahead.
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
And David, the other thing is, when I came into the business here in January, franchisees are aggressive, had great regional programs. But when you move as one voice nationally, it puts you in a stronger position. And so, as I mentioned earlier, the two for $2, Wake-up Wrap are the things, the types of promotions that you're going to see the back half of the year and then into next year, and we're very pleased with this and the attachment that we're getting with these type of offers. So, we're very encouraged by the momentum, but it's a competitive marketplace out there.

Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So, David, I know value is very close to your heart since you and I have debated it many times, but I think Dave has done some fantastic things in his – was it nine months now?
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. Six months since taking over the business.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Six months since taking over the business. Two of them are the focus on drive-thrus, he's really added value, he's a drive-thru expert. And secondly, he's really made us think hard about national values. So two great things he's brought to the company, and I think you should take that as a trend for the future.
David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC

Thank you, sir. Our next question will come from Matt DiFrisco with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Your questions please.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Thank you very much. I guess moving over to digital a little bit and changing the topic, can you give us some detail and some metrics on what you're seeing as far as DD Perks and the loyalty, how much as a percentage of sales stems from that? Some of your peers have really only seen growth based off of their most loyal customers, where there seems to be this stagnant business in from the guys who are non-loyalty based. So if you could tell us, maybe compare year-over-year what you've progressed as far as your DD Perks participation as a percent of overall sales in the quarter?
Sherrill Kaplan - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Hi, there. This is Sherrill Kaplan. We are pleased with the sequential growth. However, we're not going to chat about it on this call today.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Can you tell us any sort of metrics on it? How many members you have versus last year? How much did they out-comp your non-Perks customer?
Sherrill Kaplan - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
So last quarter we added 500,000 members and we are pleased with that progress.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. What we have now got is just about 7 million Perks members. Obviously, we feel good about it. The reason we don't comment on it is, we would comment every single quarter, we tend to do it once a year in detail. But Perks continues to grow. The comps continue to be – actually we have a debate internally, the comps are very good. We then look at outside data, which tells us they are actually even better than we think. So the bottom line is we're really pleased with our Perks numbers.
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. As Sherrill mentioned the 500,000 new acquisitions that we got, we are really pleased with those numbers. We continue to see us growing on that base. This is going to be a great lever for us going forward.
Of course, they're our most loyal guests as you mentioned about the performance of the non-Perks members, is one that we want to continue to expand this and bring people in. But as soon as – when we bring people into loyalty, and especially when we also bring them into the On-the-Go ordering process, the velocity and rate of how they use our brand continues to accelerate.
So this is going to be a critical lever for us as it is for many players in the industry. And we think we have some of the very best consumer facing technology out in the marketplace. And it's just making sure that we get awareness and trial. And so we will continue to push on our recruiting efforts going forward because it's critical to our long-term success.
Sherrill Kaplan - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Yeah. One thing I would just add to that is On-the-Go did see sequential growth and as we talked about before, once people try On-the-Go, we've seen over a 70% retrial rate. So once they try On-the-Go mobile ordering, they really stick. So we're thrilled about that and as Dave mentioned, we're going to double down on awareness and acquisition into that platform.

Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So for the record for those...
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Did you disclose? (1:00:35)
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So for the record for those who heard me talk about it, I finally got my wife onto On-the-Go, and she can't stop using it now. So once you get people to try it, that's a big breakthrough.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
What was On-the-Go in this quarter versus – you said it sequentially improved from 1Q?
Sherrill Kaplan - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Yeah. We've decided to just release it when we've hit some significant milestone. So today we chose not to share the numbers.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Okay.
Sherrill Kaplan - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
But we're pleased about the growth.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC

Thank you, sir. We have a question from the line of David Tarantino with R.W. Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Hi, good morning. I have a question about the new image and design of the restaurant you're rolling out. And I just wonder if you could talk about philosophically, how you're thinking about the investment costs? And whether this is an opportunity to streamline the design in a way that lowers the investment costs and increases the ROIC profile?
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. Dave, it's a great question, we're excited to have you see all of this at our Investor Day in February as well. Look, our go to market strategy on cost is front and center, not just in the designs, but also in the equipment package and the size of the facility as well. So this is all part of our return model. It's something that we work very closely with our franchise leadership to make sure that we get this right. So I think there is a great opportunity for us to continue to streamline this. And balance that with new technologies as well that come into this.
So there is a lot of cross currents there, but making sure we have the right affordable model that we can scale is what we partner with our franchisees on, so that we can deliver the best and something that we can get out in the marketplace as quickly as possible.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
I think it's worth saying that the focus we've had in this call on drive-thru is, it's something that will continue into our development of the new store, because our guests are telling us they like to go through the drive-thru. I mean we've got one store that has both drive-thru and front counter, 96% of the revenue goes through the drive-thru. Now that is an exception, I don't want anyone to write that that's a trend, but it does demonstrate that people want convenience. And if you can get the convenience like that, that does mean that we should be able to develop a smaller box.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Great. That's helpful. And Nigel, can you just clarify the comment you made about focusing the conversation on system sales growth, rather than unit development?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
That would be helpful. Thanks.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. So David, I'm pulling up on the Nation's Restaurant News that you'll all probably go away and look up is the June 19 edition. And it has the top 100. And it's kind of interesting when you read through it. And we took our board through it in our last meeting. And we come out number three in terms of system growth. Some brands there, it was an interesting exercise of asking people who's the number one, which won't surprise you, but it's Starbucks. We are number three. You can find out who number two were.
But system-wide growth really shows the quality that we are opening. And I go back to my earlier comment, will you as analysts and investors rather open a store doing, let's say, $20,000 a week or a store doing $2,000 a week? The answer is $20,000 a week, because you want to get that royalty.

So we are very focused on that in the future. I think we can put more through our boxes as we just said. So we're very focused on that. And I want to repeat, as I've said many times, we're a development machine, despite the fact we took down guidance. And you put development together with comps, that is a model that hardly anyone of us has, that's what makes us different. It is constant development and most other businesses can talk about comps. They can't talk about development in the U.S. the way we can.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Operator, we probably have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. Our final question will come from the line of Will Slabaugh with Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, guys. I had a question on the simplification initiatives as it relates to menu innovation. It seems like menu innovation and new product introductions have been a primary reason that your comps have remained mostly positive here in the past couple of years. So, I'm curious how this strategy as it evolves might impacts your thoughts around future menu innovation and should we think about this just going maybe, deeper into current platforms or is there still the potential to add platforms going forward?
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yes. We definitely see a potential to add platforms. And as Chris rightly pointed out and I said in my opening, look, simplification we think is the unlock for innovation that gets us to lean into that position of being beverage-led On the-Go brand.
We are certainly going to be very focused on food like we had been in the past and donuts as well. But we like the idea of going after multiple platforms under beverages and being that beverage-led On-the-Go brand. But the sequencing of this has to be right. And the first thing is we have to, as we go through this simplification effort, call some of the things and the complexities that have gotten into our restaurants, and we feel like this is the responsible way to go after that. But we brought in some new culinary talent into the organization as well, I'm in the marketplace for a CMO candidate in addition to that and so we're excited about the folks that we're bringing in here to complement the great team that we have and to fill the pipeline on innovation going forward.
Will Slabaugh - Stephens, Inc.
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. That will conclude our time for questions. I'd like to turn the program back over to Nigel for any additional or closing remarks.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thank you very much. So in closing, I think it's worth saying, we have a beautiful business model. Looking at various numbers around the room, not many brands can sit up here and talk about continuing to grow their margins over 50% as adjusted operating income margins. We've got a model that's enabled us to deliver consistent results through the years as we talked about. And I think key to this is the engagement of our franchisees, that's very important.
At Dunkin, franchisees are fully committed to the brand and to Dave's vision for the future. He has been true added value to our company. I'm confident also that Jason will bring a similar leadership and passion to Baskin-Robbins. I think we're doing all the right things for our future and we're truly focused on the future of our company. And the key today is making the customers central to everything we do, in digital leadership, convenience, obviously cost controls is also something that's important, currently we didn't talk about that, but I think we exhibited great cost control in the quarter.
And then, talking about costs and profitability, franchisee profitability is absolutely critical in every part of our business and we're really focused on that. So I think when you put all those ingredients together that will enable us to continue to deliver strong growth into the next decade. So with that, thank you for listening and I'll speak to you again soon.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

	Why Dunkin Brands Group Inc (DNKN) Stock Shouldn’t Disappoint

Corporate America may run on leverage, but there’s no doubt that individual Americans run on coffee. Enter Dunkin Brands Group Inc (NASDAQ:DNKN) to serve that need. Overall, DNKN stock had good news to report last quarter, including a dividend increase of 7.5% from $0.30 in 2016 to $0.3225, and I expect Dunkin’ to have more good news this coming quarter. Second-quarter earnings come out on Thursday.

DNKN’s unique asset light model — and by asset light, I really mean light at 100% franchised — continues to work very well for them.
It allows for financial flexibility (no big capital expenditures for company-owned stores) and encourages the HQ to focus attention on enhancing brand value and customer loyalty. As such, margins are high and risk to the company is low.
It’s a fantastic business model.
Dunkin’ has done right by its franchisees by strategically investing in its digital assets. The company now has 10 million email subscribers, 6.5 million DD Perk Members and 16 million social connections. While not as tech savvy as say, Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), DNKN is headed in the same direction to foster a closer 1:1 connection with the consumer.
DNKN’s Domestic Growth Still in Early Stages
People who haven’t spent much time outside of the east coast, may not realize that Dunkin’ hasn’t really made it west of Missouri yet.
This presents a huge opportunity to cover uncharted territory. DNKN is concentrated in New England, which has been its bread and butter. It has methodically expanded outwards from there. So its largest geographic opportunities are in the south and western parts of the U.S. now. In the west, penetration is at a ratio of 1:286,400 compared to 1:8,700 in the core northeast markets.
DNKN estimates the market opportunity in the central and western part of the U.S. at 5,000 stores, which would mean a penetration rate of 1:23,800 — well below that of its core markets. There’s still fill in room in the northeast as well for another 300 stores or so.

Click to Enlarge
All in all, 17,000 stores is the long-term goal for Dunkin in the U.S. As of Q1, there were 8,884. So, the company will effectively double its current footprint.
While DNKN builds out, I should say their franchisees build out, each incremental unit will be accretive. Returns based on the average store in the emerging and western parts of the U.S. are excellent.

History[edit]
In 1973, British food company J. Lyons and Co. purchased Baskin-Robbins from United Brands. J. Lyons and Co. then merged with Allied Breweries, becoming Allied-Lyons in 1978. Allied-Lyons acquired Dunkin' Donuts in 1989. The following year, Dunkin' Donuts acquired Mister Donut.
In 1994, Allied-Lyons merged with Pedro Domecq S.A., becoming Allied Domecq. The restaurant operations were merged under a subsidiary named Allied Domecq Quick Service Restaurants. In 1997, Togo's was acquired by Allied Domecq.[3]
In 2004, Allied Domecq Quick Service Restaurants was renamed Dunkin' Brands, Inc..
On December 12, 2005, Pernod Ricard, which had just taken control of Allied Domecq, announced the sale of Dunkin' Brands to a consortium of private equity firms consisting of Bain Capital, The Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners for $2.425 billion in cash.[4] Dunkin' Brands, Inc. was renamed Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. after the transaction.
On November 30, 2007, Dunkin' Brands sold Togo's to Mainsail Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity firm, in partnership with Tony Gioia, a former president of Baskin-Robbins.[5][6]
In July 2011, Dunkin' Brands completed its initial public offering and became listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ-GS large cap) under the symbol “DNKN.”
In August 2012, Dunkin' Brands became completely independent of the private equity firms.[7]

History[edit]
In 1973, British food company J. Lyons and Co. purchased Baskin-Robbins from United Brands. J. Lyons and Co. then merged with Allied Breweries, becoming Allied-Lyons in 1978. Allied-Lyons acquired Dunkin' Donuts in 1989. The following year, Dunkin' Donuts acquired Mister Donut.
In 1994, Allied-Lyons merged with Pedro Domecq S.A., becoming Allied Domecq. The restaurant operations were merged under a subsidiary named Allied Domecq Quick Service Restaurants. In 1997, Togo's was acquired by Allied Domecq.[3]
In 2004, Allied Domecq Quick Service Restaurants was renamed Dunkin' Brands, Inc..
On December 12, 2005, Pernod Ricard, which had just taken control of Allied Domecq, announced the sale of Dunkin' Brands to a consortium of private equity firms consisting of Bain Capital, The Carlyle Group and Thomas H. Lee Partners for $2.425 billion in cash.[4] Dunkin' Brands, Inc. was renamed Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. after the transaction.
On November 30, 2007, Dunkin' Brands sold Togo's to Mainsail Partners, a San Francisco-based private equity firm, in partnership with Tony Gioia, a former president of Baskin-Robbins.[5][6]
In July 2011, Dunkin' Brands completed its initial public offering and became listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ-GS large cap) under the symbol “DNKN.”
In August 2012, Dunkin' Brands became completely independent of the private equity firms.[7]

In 2006, Dunkin’ Brands assembled a culinary dream team of acclaimed chefs to work with the company’s research and development team to create new and innovative menu choices.

In 2008, the culinary dream team helped Baskin-Robbins launch Soft Serve, as well as 31° Below™ sundaes and pies.
In 2008, the culinary dream team helped Dunkin' Donuts launch its new, all-day Oven-Toasted menu, the most significant change to Dunkin' Donuts’ product lineup since the company began offering espresso-based beverages in 2003. The team also introduced Dunkin' Donuts' DDSMART® menu of better-for-you options.
In 2009, the culinary dream team helped Baskin-Robbins launch its BRight Choices® menu of better-for-you flavor options.
In 2010, the team helped Dunkin' Donuts launch fun and delicious Bagel Twists.
In 2012, the team helped launch an expanded lineup of Dunkin' Donuts Bakery Sandwiches, including Ham & Cheese, Turkey, Cheddar & Bacon, Chicken Salad and Tuna Salad.
In 2013, the team helped launch a number of innovative and eye-catching ice cream cake designs for Baskin-Robbins, including its Conversation Heart Cake, Ladybug Cake and Pumpkin Patch Cake.

	Forward-Looking Statements




	This report on Form 10-K, as well as other written reports and oral statements that we make from time to time, includes statements that express our opinions, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or projections regarding future events or future results and therefore are, or may be deemed to be, “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Generally these statements can be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “feel,” “forecast,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “should” or “would” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts.




	By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report and in our other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.




	Although we base these forward-looking statements on assumptions that we believe are reasonable when made, we caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate, are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this report, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods.




	Given these risks and uncertainties, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of those statements to reflect future events or developments.

























	PART I










	Item 1. Business.




	Our Company




	We are one of the world’s leading franchisors of quick service restaurants (“QSRs”) serving hot and cold coffee and baked goods, as well as hard serve ice cream. We franchise restaurants under our Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins brands. With over 20,000 points of distribution in more than 60 countries worldwide, we believe that our portfolio has strong brand awareness in our key markets.




	We believe that our 100% franchised business model offers strategic and financial benefits. For example, because we generally do not own or operate restaurants, our Company is able to focus on menu innovation, marketing, franchisee coaching and support, and other initiatives to drive the overall success of our brand. Financially, our franchised model allows us to grow our points of distribution and brand recognition with limited capital investment by us.




	We operate our business in four segments: Dunkin’ Donuts U.S., Dunkin’ Donuts International, Baskin-Robbins International and Baskin-Robbins U.S. In fiscal year


	2016


	, our Dunkin’ Donuts segments generated revenues of


	$630.9 million


	, or


	79%


	 of our total segment revenues, of which


	$608.0 million


	 was in the U.S. segment and


	$22.9 million


	 was in the international segment. In fiscal year


	2016


	, our Baskin-Robbins segments generated revenues of


	$166.5 million


	, of which


	$119.0 million


	 was in the international segment and


	$47.5 million


	 was in the U.S. segment. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were


	12,258


	 Dunkin’ Donuts points of distribution, of which


	8,828


	 were in the U.S. and


	3,430


	 were international, and


	7,822


	 Baskin-Robbins points of distribution, of which


	5,284


	 were international and


	2,538


	 were in the U.S. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included herein for segment information.




	We generate revenue from four primary sources: (i) royalty income and fees associated with franchised restaurants; (ii) rental income from restaurant properties that we lease or sublease to franchisees; (iii) sales of ice cream and other products to franchisees in certain international markets; and (iv) other income including fees for the licensing of the Dunkin’ Donuts brand for products sold in certain retail channels (such as Dunkin’ K-Cup® pods and retail packaged coffee), the licensing of the rights to manufacture Baskin-Robbins ice cream products to a third party for sale to U.S. franchisees, refranchising gains, transfer fees from franchisees, and online training fees. Prior to completing the sale of all company-operated restaurants in fiscal year 2016, we also generated revenue from retail store sales at our company-operated restaurants




	Our history




	Both of our brands have a rich heritage dating back to the 1940s, when Bill Rosenberg founded his first restaurant, subsequently renamed Dunkin’ Donuts, and Burt Baskin and Irv Robbins each founded a chain of ice cream shops that eventually combined to form Baskin-Robbins. Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin’ Donuts were individually acquired by Allied Domecq PLC in 1973 and 1989, respectively. The brands were organized under the Allied Domecq Quick Service Restaurants subsidiary, which was renamed Dunkin’ Brands, Inc. in 2004. Allied Domecq was acquired in July 2005 by Pernod Ricard S.A. In March of 2006, we were acquired by investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital Partners, LLC, The Carlyle Group, and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. through a holding company that was incorporated in Delaware on November 22, 2005, and was later renamed Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. In July 2011, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”). Upon the completion of the IPO, our common stock became listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “DNKN.”









	Our brands




	Dunkin


	’


	 Donuts-U.S.




	Dunkin’ Donuts is a leading U.S. QSR concept, and is the QSR market leader in donut and bagel categories for servings. Dunkin’ Donuts is also a national QSR leader for breakfast sandwich servings. Since the late 1980s, Dunkin’ Donuts has transformed itself into a coffee and beverage-based concept, and is a national QSR leader in servings in the hot regular/decaf/flavored coffee category and the iced regular/decaf/flavored coffee category, with sales of over 1.7 billion servings of total hot and iced coffee annually. Over the last ten fiscal years, Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. systemwide sales have grown at a 6.1% compound annual growth rate and total Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. points of distribution grew from 5,385 to


	8,828


	. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 86% of these points of distribution are traditional restaurants consisting of end-cap, in-line and stand-alone restaurants, many with drive-thrus, and gas and convenience locations. In addition, we have alternative points of distribution (“APODs”), such as full- or self-service kiosks in offices, hospitals, colleges, airports, grocery stores, wholesale clubs, and other smaller-footprint properties. We believe that Dunkin’ Donuts continues to have significant growth potential in the U.S. given its strong brand awareness and variety of restaurant formats. For fiscal year


	2016


	, the Dunkin’ Donuts franchise system generated U.S. systemwide sales of


	$8.2 billion


	, which accounted for approximately 76% of our global systemwide sales, and had


	8,828


	 U.S. points of distribution (with more than 50% of our restaurants having drive-thrus) at period end.

	Baskin-Robbins-U.S.




	Baskin-Robbins is one of the leading QSR chains in the U.S. for servings of hard-serve ice cream and develops and sells a full range of frozen ice cream treats such as cones, cakes, sundaes, and frozen beverages. Baskin-Robbins enjoys 89% aided brand awareness in the U.S., and we believe the brand is known for its innovative flavors, popular “Birthday Club” program and ice cream flavor library of over 1,300 different offerings. Additionally, our Baskin-Robbins U.S. segment has experienced comparable store sales growth in each of the last six fiscal years. We believe we can capitalize on the brand’s strengths and continue generating renewed excitement for the brand. Baskin-Robbins’ “31 flavors,” offering consumers a different flavor for each day of the month, is recognized by ice cream consumers nationwide. For fiscal year


	2016


	, the Baskin-Robbins franchise system generated U.S. systemwide sales of approximately


	$603.6 million


	, which accounted for approximately 6% of our global systemwide sales. Over the last ten fiscal years, total Baskin-Robbins U.S. points of distribution declined from 2,976 to


	2,538


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	International operations




	Our international business is primarily conducted via joint ventures and country or territorial license arrangements with “master franchisees,” who both operate and sub-franchise the brand within their licensed areas. Increasingly, in certain markets, we are migrating to a model with multiple franchisees in one country, including markets in the United Kingdom, Germany, China, and Mexico. Our international franchise system, predominantly located across Asia and the Middle East, generated systemwide sales of $2.0 billion for fiscal year


	2016


	, which represented approximately 19% of Dunkin’ Brands’ global systemwide sales. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, Dunkin’ Donuts had


	3,430


	 international points of distribution in


	44


	 countries (excluding the U.S.), which grew from 1,908 points of distribution as of December 31, 2006, and represented


	$707.2 million


	 of international systemwide sales for fiscal year


	2016


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, Baskin-Robbins had


	5,284


	 international points of distribution in


	51


	 countries (excluding the U.S.), which grew from 2,917 points of distribution as of December 31, 2006, and represented approximately


	$1.3 billion


	 of international systemwide sales for fiscal year


	2016


	. We believe that we have opportunities to continue to grow our Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins concepts internationally in new and existing markets through brand and menu differentiation.









	Overview of franchising




	Franchising is a business arrangement whereby a service organization, the franchisor, grants an operator, the franchisee, a license to sell the franchisor’s products and services and use its system and trademarks in a given area, with or without exclusivity. In the context of the restaurant industry, a franchisee pays the franchisor for its concept, strategy, marketing, operating system, training, purchasing power, and brand recognition. Franchisees are solely responsible for the day-to-day operations in each franchised restaurant, including but not limited to all labor and employment decisions, such as hiring, promoting, discharging, scheduling, and setting wages, benefits, and all other terms of employment with respect to their employees.




	Franchisee relationships




	We seek to maximize the alignment of our interests with those of our franchisees. For instance, we do not derive additional income through serving as the supplier to our domestic franchisees. In addition, because the ability to execute our strategy is dependent upon the strength of our relationships with our franchisees, we maintain a multi-tiered advisory council system to foster an active dialogue with franchisees. The advisory council system provides feedback and input on all major brand initiatives and is a source of timely information on evolving consumer preferences, which assists new product introductions and advertising campaigns.




	Unlike certain other QSR franchise systems, we generally do not guarantee our franchisees’ financing obligations. From time to time, at our discretion, we may offer voluntary financing to existing franchisees for specific programs such as the purchase of specialized equipment. We intend to continue our past practice of limiting our guarantee of financing for franchisees.




	Franchise agreement terms




	For each franchised restaurant in the U.S., we enter into a franchise agreement covering a standard set of terms and conditions. A prospective franchisee may elect to open either a single-branded distribution point or a multi-branded distribution point. In addition, and depending upon the market, a franchisee may purchase the right to open a franchised restaurant at one or multiple locations (via a store development agreement, or “SDA”). When granting the right to operate a restaurant to a potential franchisee, we will generally evaluate the potential franchisee’s prior food-service experience, history in managing profit and loss operations, financial history, and available capital and financing. We also evaluate potential new franchisees based on financial measures, including liquid asset and net worth minimums for each brand.

	The typical franchise agreement in the U.S. has a 20-year term. The majority of our franchisees have entered into prime leases with a third-party landlord. The Company is the lessee on certain land leases (the Company leases the land and erects a building) or improved leases (lessor owns the land and building) covering restaurants and other properties. In addition, the Company has leased and subleased land and buildings to other franchisees. When we sublease properties to franchisees, the sublease generally follows the prime lease term. Our leases to franchisees are typically for an overall term of 20 years.




	We help domestic franchisees select sites and develop restaurants that conform to the physical specifications of our typical restaurant. Each domestic franchisee is responsible for selecting a site, but must obtain site approval from us based on accessibility, visibility, proximity to other restaurants, and targeted demographic factors including population density and traffic patterns. Additionally, the franchisee must also refurbish and remodel each restaurant periodically (typically every five and ten years, respectively).




	We currently require each domestic franchisee’s managing owner and/or designated manager to complete initial and ongoing training programs provided by us, including minimum periods of classroom and on-the-job training. We monitor quality and endeavor to ensure compliance with our standards for restaurant operations through restaurant visits in the U.S. In addition, a restaurant operation review is conducted throughout our domestic operations at least once per year. To complement these procedures, we use “Guest Satisfaction Surveys” in the U.S. to assess customer satisfaction with restaurant operations, such as product quality, restaurant cleanliness, and customer service.




	Store development agreements




	We grant domestic franchisees the right to open one or more restaurants within a specified geographic area pursuant to the terms of SDAs. An SDA specifies the number of restaurants and the mix of the brands represented by such restaurants that a franchisee is obligated to open. Each SDA also requires the franchisee to meet certain milestones in the development and opening of the restaurant and, if the franchisee meets those obligations, we agree, during the term of such SDA, not to operate or franchise new restaurants in the designated geographic area covered by such SDA. In addition to an SDA, a franchisee signs a separate franchise agreement for each restaurant developed under such SDA.




	Master franchise model and international arrangements




	Master franchise arrangements are used on a limited basis domestically (the Baskin-Robbins brand has one “territory” franchise agreement for certain Midwestern markets) but more widely internationally for both the Baskin-Robbins brand and the Dunkin’ Donuts brand. In addition, international arrangements include joint venture agreements in South Korea (both brands), Australia (Baskin-Robbins brand), and Japan (Baskin-Robbins brand), as well as single unit franchises, such as in Canada (both brands). We utilize a multi-franchise system in certain markets, including in the United Kingdom, Germany, China, and Mexico. The Company also had an interest in a joint venture in Spain for the Dunkin’ Donuts brand, which it sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016.




	Master franchise agreements are the most prevalent international relationships for both brands. Under these agreements, the applicable brand grants the master franchisee the exclusive right to develop and operate a certain number of restaurants within a particular geographic area, such as selected cities, one or more provinces or an entire country, pursuant to a development schedule that defines the number of restaurants that the master franchisee must open annually. Those development schedules customarily extend for five to ten years. If the master franchisee fails to perform its obligations, the exclusivity provision of the agreement terminates and additional franchise agreements may be put in place to develop restaurants.




	The master franchisee is generally required to pay an upfront market development fee and an upfront initial franchise fee for each developed restaurant, and, for the Dunkin’ Donuts brand, royalties. For the Baskin-Robbins brand, the master franchisee is typically required to purchase ice cream from Baskin-Robbins or an approved supplier. In most countries, the master franchisee is also required to spend a certain percentage of gross sales on advertising in such foreign country in order to promote the brand. Generally, the master franchise agreement serves as the franchise agreement for the underlying restaurants operating pursuant to such model. Depending on the individual agreement, we may permit the master franchisee to subfranchise within its territory.




	Within each of our master franchisee and joint venture organizations, training facilities have been established by the master franchisee or joint venture based on our specifications. From those training facilities, the master franchisee or joint venture trains future staff members of the international restaurants. Our master franchisees and joint venture entities also periodically send their primary training managers to the U.S. for re-certification.

	Franchise fees




	In the U.S., once a franchisee is approved, a restaurant site is approved, and a franchise agreement is signed, the franchisee will begin to develop the restaurant. Franchisees pay us an initial franchise fee for the right to operate a restaurant for one or more franchised brands. The franchisee is required to pay all or part of the initial franchise fee upfront upon execution of the franchise agreement, regardless of when the restaurant is actually opened. Initial franchise fees vary by brand, type of development agreement and geographic area of development, but generally range from $25,000 to $100,000, as shown in the table below.

























	Restaurant type

	Fees effective as of January 1, 2017 and excludes alternative points of distribution









	In addition to the payment of initial franchise fees, our U.S. Dunkin’ Donuts brand franchisees, U.S. Baskin-Robbins brand franchisees, and our international Dunkin’ Donuts brand franchisees pay us royalties on a percentage of the gross sales made from each restaurant. In the U.S., the majority of our franchise agreement renewals and the vast majority of our new franchise agreements require our franchisees to pay us a royalty of 5.9% of gross sales. During fiscal year


	2016


	, our effective royalty rate in the Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. segment was approximately 5.5% and in the Baskin-Robbins U.S. segment was approximately 4.8%. The arrangements for Dunkin’ Donuts in the majority of our international markets require royalty payments to us of 5.0% of gross sales. However, many of our larger international partners, including our South Korean joint venture partner, have agreements at a lower rate and/or based on wholesale sales to restaurants, resulting in an effective royalty rate in the Dunkin’ Donuts international segment in


	2016


	 of approximately 2.4%. We typically collect royalty payments on a weekly basis from our domestic franchisees. For the Baskin-Robbins brand in international markets, we do not generally receive royalty payments from our franchisees; instead we earn revenue from such franchisees as a result of our sale of ice cream products to them, and in


	2016


	 our effective royalty rate in this segment was approximately 0.5%. In certain instances, we supplement and modify certain SDAs, and franchise agreements entered into pursuant to such SDAs with certain incentives that may (i) reduce or eliminate the initial franchise fee associated with a franchise agreement; (ii) reduce the royalties for a specified period of the term of the franchise agreements depending on the details related to each specific incentive program; (iii) reimburse the franchisee for certain local marketing activities in excess of the minimum required; and (iv) provide certain development incentives. To qualify for any or all of these incentives, the franchisee must meet certain requirements, each of which are set forth in an addendum to the SDA and the franchise agreement. We believe these incentives will lead to accelerated development in our less mature markets.




	Franchisees in the U.S. also pay advertising fees to the brand-specific advertising funds administered by us. Franchisees make weekly contributions, generally 5% of gross sales, to the advertising funds. Franchisees may elect to increase the contribution to support general brand-building efforts or specific initiatives. The advertising funds for the U.S., which received


	$430.3


	 million in contributions from franchisees in fiscal year


	2016


	, are almost exclusively franchisee-funded and cover all expenses related to marketing, research and development, innovation, advertising and promotion, including market research, production, advertising costs, public relations, and sales promotions. We use no more than 20% of the advertising funds to cover the administrative expenses of the advertising funds and for other strategic initiatives designed to increase sales and to enhance the reputation of the brands. As the administrator of the advertising funds, we determine the content and placement of advertising, which is done through print, radio, television, online, billboards, sponsorships, and other media, all of which is sourced by agencies. Under certain circumstances, franchisees are permitted to conduct their own local advertising, but must obtain our prior approval of content and promotional plans.









	Other franchise related fees




	We lease and sublease properties to franchisees in the U.S. and in Canada, generating net rental fees when the cost charged to the franchisee exceeds the cost charged to us. For fiscal year


	2016


	, we generated 12.2%, or $101.0 million, of our total revenue from rental fees from franchisees and incurred related occupancy expenses of $57.4 million.




	We also receive a license fee from Dean Foods Co. (“Dean Foods”) as part of an arrangement whereby Dean Foods manufactures and distributes ice cream and other frozen products to Baskin-Robbins franchisees in the U.S. In connection with this agreement, Dunkin’ Brands receives a fee based on net sales of covered products. For fiscal year


	2016


	, we generated 1.3%, or $10.8 million, of our total revenue from license fees from Dean Foods.

	-

















	We distribute ice cream products to Baskin-Robbins franchisees who operate Baskin-Robbins restaurants located in certain foreign countries and receive revenue associated with those sales. For fiscal year


	2016


	, we generated 13.9%, or $114.9 million, of our total revenue from the sale of ice cream products to franchisees primarily in certain foreign countries.




	Other revenue sources include online training fees, licensing fees earned from the sale of K-Cup® pods, retail packaged coffee, and other branded products, net refranchising gains, other one-time fees such as transfer fees, and late fees. For fiscal year


	2016


	, we generated 4.9%, or $40.7 million, of our total revenue from these other sources.




	International operations




	Our international business is organized by brand and by country and/or region. Operations are primarily conducted through master franchise agreements with local operators. In certain instances, the master franchisee may have the right to sub-franchise. We utilize a multi-franchise system in certain markets, including the United Kingdom, Germany, China and Mexico. In addition, we have a joint venture with a local, publicly-traded company for the Baskin-Robbins brand in Japan, and joint ventures with local companies in Australia for the Baskin-Robbins brand and in South Korea for both the Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins brands. The Company also had an interest in a joint venture in Spain for the Dunkin’ Donuts brand, which it sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. By teaming with local operators, we believe we are better able to adapt our concepts to local business practices and consumer preferences. We have had an international presence since 1961 when the first Dunkin’ Donuts restaurant opened in Canada. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were


	5,284


	 Baskin-Robbins restaurants in


	51


	 countries outside the U.S. and


	3,430


	 Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants in


	44


	 countries outside the U.S. Baskin-Robbins points of distribution represent the majority of our international presence and accounted for approximately 65% of international systemwide sales.




	Our key markets for both brands are predominantly based in Asia and the Middle East, which accounted for approximately 70% and 17%, respectively, of international systemwide sales for fiscal year


	2016


	. For fiscal year


	2016


	, $2.0 billion of total systemwide sales were generated by restaurants located in international markets, which represented approximately 19% of total systemwide sales, with the Dunkin’ Donuts brand accounting for


	$707.2 million


	 and the Baskin-Robbins brand accounting for


	$1.3 billion


	 of our international systemwide sales. For the same period, our revenues from international operations totaled $141.9 million, with the Baskin-Robbins brand generating approximately 84% of such revenues.

	South Korea     




	Restaurants in South Korea accounted for approximately 36% of total systemwide sales from international operations for fiscal year


	2016


	. Baskin-Robbins accounted for 67% of such sales. In South Korea, we conduct business through a 33.3% ownership stake in a combination Dunkin’ Donuts brand/Baskin-Robbins brand joint venture, with South Korean shareholders owning the remaining 66.7% of the joint venture. The joint venture acts as the master franchisee for South Korea, sub-franchising the Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins brands to franchisees. The joint venture also manufactures and supplies restaurants located in South Korea with ice cream, donuts, and coffee products.




	Japan




	Restaurants in Japan accounted for approximately 21% of total systemwide sales from international operations for fiscal year


	2016


	, 100% of which came from Baskin-Robbins. We conduct business in Japan through a 43.3% ownership stake in a Baskin-Robbins brand joint venture. Our partner also owns a 43.3% interest in the joint venture, with the remaining 13.4% owned by public shareholders. The joint venture primarily manufactures and sells ice cream to restaurants in Japan and acts as master franchisee for the country.

	Middle East




	The Middle East represents another key region for us. Restaurants in the Middle East accounted for approximately 17% of total systemwide sales from international operations for fiscal year


	2016


	. Baskin-Robbins accounted for approximately 68% of such sales. We conduct operations in the Middle East through master franchise arrangements.




	Industry overview




	According to The NPD Group/CREST® (“CREST®”), the QSR segment of the U.S. restaurant industry accounted for approximately $282 billion of the total $443 billion restaurant industry sales in the U.S. for the twelve months ended


	December 31, 2016


	. The U.S. restaurant industry is generally categorized into segments by price point ranges, the types of food and beverages offered, and service available to consumers. QSR is a restaurant format characterized by counter or drive-thru ordering and limited, or no, table service. QSRs generally seek to capitalize on consumer desires for quality and convenient food at economical prices.




	Our Dunkin’ Donuts brand competes in the QSR segment categories and subcategories that include coffee, donuts, muffins, bagels, and breakfast sandwiches. In addition, in the U.S., our Dunkin’ Donuts brand has historically focused on the breakfast daypart, which we define to include the portion of each day from 5:00 a.m. until 11:00 a.m. While, according to CREST® data, the compound annual growth rate for total QSR daypart visits in the U.S. was 1% over the five-year period ended December 31, 2016, the compound annual growth rate for QSR visits in the U.S. during the morning meal daypart was 2% over the same five-year period. There can be no assurance that such growth rates will be sustained in the future.




	For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, there were sales of over 8 billion restaurant servings of coffee in the U.S., 86% of which were attributable to the QSR segment, according to CREST® data. According to CREST®, total coffee servings at QSR have grown at a 4% compound annual rate for the five-year period ending December 31, 2016. Over the years, our Dunkin’ Donuts brand has evolved into a predominantly coffee-based concept, with approximately 58% of Dunkin’ Donuts’ U.S. systemwide sales for fiscal year 2016 generated from coffee and other beverages. We believe QSRs, including Dunkin’ Donuts, are positioned to capture additional coffee market share through an increased focus on coffee offerings.




	Our Baskin-Robbins brand competes primarily in QSR segment categories and subcategories that include hard-serve ice cream as well as those that include soft serve ice cream, frozen yogurt, shakes, malts, floats, and cakes. While both of our brands compete internationally, approximately 68% of Baskin-Robbins restaurants are located outside of the U.S. and represent the majority of our total international sales and points of distribution.




	Competition




	We compete primarily in the QSR segment of the restaurant industry and face significant competition from a wide variety of restaurants, convenience stores, and other outlets that provide consumers with coffee, baked goods, sandwiches, and ice cream on an international, national, regional, and local level. We believe that we compete based on, among other things, product quality, restaurant concept, service, convenience, value perception, and price. Our competition continues to intensify as competitors increase the breadth and depth of their product offerings, particularly during the breakfast daypart, and open new units. Although new competitors may emerge at any time due to the low barriers to entry, our competitors include: 7-Eleven, Burger King, Cold Stone Creamery, Cumberland Farms, Dairy Queen, McDonald’s, Panera Bread, Quick Trip, Starbucks, Subway, Taco Bell, Tim Hortons, WaWa, and Wendy’s, among others. Additionally, we compete with QSRs, specialty restaurants, and other retail concepts for prime restaurant locations and qualified franchisees.




	Licensing




	We derive licensing revenue from agreements with Dean Foods for domestic ice cream sales, with The J.M. Smucker Co. (“Smuckers”) for the sale of packaged coffee in certain retail outlets (primarily grocery retail), and with Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (“KGM”) and Smuckers for sale of Dunkin’ K-Cup® pods in certain retail outlets (primarily grocery retail), as well as from other licensees. For the 52 weeks ending December 25, 2016, the Dunkin’ Donuts branded 12 oz. original blend coffee, which is distributed by Smuckers, was the #1 stock-keeping unit nationally in the premium coffee category. For the 52 weeks ending December 25, 2016, sales of our 12 oz. original blend, as expressed in total equivalent units and dollar sales, were double that of the next closest competitor. Additionally, for the 52 weeks ending December 25, 2016, the 10 count carton of our original blend K-Cup® pods, also distributed by Smuckers, was the #1 stock-keeping unit nationally in the K-Cup® pod category. Through December 25, 2016, we have sold more than 550 million Dunkin’ K-Cup® pods in grocery outlets since launch in May 2015. With the introduction of Dunkin’ K-Cup® pods into grocery outlets, more than 2.4 billion cups of Dunkin’ Donuts coffee were sold through grocery outlets during calendar year 2016. In early 2017, the Company launched Dunkin’ Donuts branded ready-to-drink (“RTD”) bottled iced coffee for sale in grocery, convenience stores, and mass merchandisers, as well as inside Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants, across the U.S., through an agreement with The Coca-Cola Company.

	Marketing




	We coordinate domestic advertising and marketing at the national and local levels through our administration of brand specific advertising funds. The goals of our marketing strategy include driving comparable store sales and brand differentiation, increasing our total coffee and beverage sales, protecting and growing our morning daypart sales, and growing our afternoon daypart sales. Generally, our domestic franchisees contribute 5% of weekly gross retail sales to fund brand specific advertising funds. The funds are used for various national and local advertising campaigns including print, radio, television, online, mobile, loyalty, billboards, and sponsorships. Over the past ten years, our U.S. franchisees have invested approximately $2.6 billion on advertising to increase brand awareness and restaurant performance across both brands. Additionally, we have various pricing strategies, so that our products appeal to a broad range of customers. In August 2012, we launched the Dunkin’ Donuts mobile application for payment and gifting, which built the foundation for one-to-one marketing with our customers. In January 2014, we launched a new DD Perks® Rewards loyalty program nationally, which is fully integrated with the Dunkin’ Donuts mobile application and allows us to engage our customers in these one-to-one marketing interactions. In June 2016, we continued to leverage digital technologies to drive customer loyalty and enhance the restaurant experience through the launch of On-the-Go mobile ordering for our DD Perks® members, which enables users to order ahead and speed to the front of the line in restaurants. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 our DD Perks® Rewards loyalty program had over 6 million members.




	The supply chain




	Domestic




	We do not typically supply products to our domestic franchisees. As a result, with the exception of licensing fees paid by Dean Foods on domestic ice cream sales, we do not typically derive revenues from product distribution. Our franchisees’ suppliers include Rich Products Corp., Dean Foods, The Coca-Cola Company, and KGM. In addition, our franchisees’ primary coffee roasters currently are New England Tea & Coffee Co., Inc., Mother Parkers Tea & Coffee Inc., S&D Coffee, Inc., and Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA, Inc., and their primary donut mix suppliers currently are Continental Mills and Pennant Ingredients Inc. We periodically review our relationships with licensees and approved suppliers and evaluate whether those relationships continue to be on competitive or advantageous terms for us and our franchisees.




	Purchasing




	Purchasing for the Dunkin’ Donuts brand is facilitated by National DCP, LLC (the “NDCP”), which is a Delaware limited liability company operated as a cooperative owned by its franchisee members. The NDCP is managed by a staff of supply chain professionals who report directly to the NDCP’s board of directors. The NDCP has approximately 1,500 employees including executive leadership, sourcing professionals, warehouse staff, and drivers. The NDCP board of directors has eight voting franchisee members, one NDCP non-voting member, and one independent non-voting member. In addition, our Chief Financial Officer is a voting member of the NDCP board. The NDCP engages in purchasing, warehousing, and distribution of food and supplies on behalf of participating restaurants and some international markets. The NDCP program provides franchisee members nationwide the benefits of scale while fostering consistent product quality across the Dunkin’ Donuts brand. We do not control the NDCP and have only limited contractual rights associated with managing that franchisee-owned purchasing and distribution cooperative.




	Manufacturing of Dunkin


	’


	 Donuts bakery goods




	Centralized production is another element of our supply chain that is designed to support growth for the Dunkin’ Donuts brand. Centralized manufacturing locations (“CMLs”) are franchisee-owned and -operated facilities for the centralized production of donuts and bakery goods. The CMLs deliver freshly baked products to Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants on a daily basis and are designed to provide consistent quality products while simplifying restaurant-level operations. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were 100 CMLs (of varying size and capacity) in the U.S. CMLs are an important part of franchise economics, and are supportive of profit building initiatives as well as protecting brand quality standards and consistency.









	Certain of our Dunkin’ Donuts brand restaurants produce donuts and bakery goods on-site rather than sourcing from CMLs. Many of such restaurants, known as full producers, also supply other local Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants that do not have access to CMLs. In addition, in newer markets, Dunkin’ Donuts brand restaurants source donuts and bakery goods that are finished in restaurants. We believe that this “just baked on demand” donut manufacturing platform enables the Dunkin’ Donuts brand to more efficiently expand its restaurant base in newer markets where franchisees may not have access to a CML.




	Baskin-Robbins ice cream




	We outsource the manufacturing and distribution of ice cream products for the domestic Baskin-Robbins brand franchisees to Dean Foods, which strengthens our relationships with franchisees and allows us to focus on our core franchising operations.

	International




	Dunkin


	’


	 Donuts




	International Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees are responsible for sourcing their own supplies, subject to compliance with our standards. Most also produce their own donuts following the Dunkin’ Donuts brand’s approved processes. Franchisees in some markets source donuts produced by a brand approved third party supplier. Franchisees are permitted to source coffee from a number of coffee roasters approved by the brand, including the NDCP, as well as certain approved regional and local roasters. In certain countries, our international franchisees source virtually everything locally within their market while in others our international franchisees source most of their supplies from the NDCP. Where supplies are sourced locally, we help identify and approve those suppliers. In addition, we assist our international franchisees in identifying regional and global suppliers with the goal of leveraging the purchasing volume for pricing and product continuity advantages.




	Baskin-Robbins




	The Baskin-Robbins manufacturing network is comprised of 14 facilities, none of which are owned or operated by us, that supply our international markets with ice cream products. We utilize facilities owned by Dean Foods to produce ice cream products which we purchase and distribute to many of our international markets. Certain international franchisees rely on third-party-owned facilities to supply ice cream products to them, including facilities in Ireland and Canada. The Baskin-Robbins brand restaurants in India and Russia are supported by master franchisee-owned facilities in those respective countries while the restaurants in Japan and South Korea are supported by the joint venture-owned facilities located within each country.




	Research and development




	New product innovation is a critical component of our success. We believe the development of successful new products for each brand attracts new customers, increases comparable store sales, and allows franchisees to expand into other dayparts. New product research and development is located in a state-of-the-art facility at our headquarters in Canton, Massachusetts. The facility includes a sensory lab, a quality assurance lab, and a demonstration test kitchen. We rely on our internal culinary team, which uses consumer research, to develop and test new products.









	Operational support




	Substantially all of our executive management, finance, marketing, legal, technology, human resources, and operations support functions are conducted from our global headquarters in Canton, Massachusetts. In the United States, our franchise operations for both brands are organized into regions, each of which is headed by a regional vice president and directors of operations supported by field personnel who interact directly with the franchisees. Our international businesses are organized by region and have dedicated marketing and restaurant operations support teams that work with our master licensees and joint venture partners to improve restaurant operations and restaurant-level economics. Management of a franchise restaurant is the responsibility of the franchisee, who is trained in our techniques and is responsible for ensuring that the day-to-day operations of the restaurant are in compliance with our operating standards. We have implemented a computer-based disaster recovery program to address the possibility that a natural (or other form of) disaster may impact the information technology systems located at our Canton, Massachusetts headquarters.




	Regulatory matters




	Domestic




	We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state, and local laws affecting the operation of our respective businesses, including various health, sanitation, fire, and safety standards. In some jurisdictions our restaurants are required by law to display nutritional information about our products. Each restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include zoning, health, safety, sanitation, building, and fire agencies in the jurisdiction in which the restaurant is located. Franchisee-owned NDCP and CMLs are licensed and subject to similar regulations by federal, state, and local governments.




	We and our franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act and various other laws governing such matters as minimum wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions, and citizenship requirements. A significant number of food-service personnel employed by franchisees are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage.




	Our franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The FTC’s franchise rule and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document (“FDD”) containing certain information to prospective franchisees and a number of states require registration of the FDD with state authorities. We are operating under exemptions from registration in several states based on our experience and aggregate net worth. Substantive state laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship













	-


	 8


	-

















	exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. We believe that the FDD for each of our Dunkin’ Donuts brand and our Baskin-Robbins brand, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures, comply in all material respects with both the FTC franchise rule and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises.




	International




	Internationally, we and our franchisees are subject to national and local laws and regulations that often are similar to those affecting us and our franchisees in the U.S., including laws and regulations concerning franchises, labor, health, sanitation, and safety. International Baskin-Robbins brand and Dunkin’ Donuts brand restaurants are also often subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment, and laws regulating foreign investment. We believe that the international disclosure statements, franchise offering documents, and franchising procedures for our Baskin-Robbins brand and Dunkin’ Donuts brand comply in all material respects with the laws of the applicable countries.









	Environmental




	Our operations, including the selection and development of the properties we lease and sublease to our franchisees and any construction or improvements we make at those locations, are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including environmental, zoning, and land use requirements. Our properties are sometimes located in developed commercial or industrial areas and might previously have been occupied by more environmentally significant operations, such as gasoline stations and dry cleaners. Environmental laws sometimes require owners or operators of contaminated property to remediate that property, regardless of fault. While we have been required to, and are continuing to, clean up contamination at a limited number of our locations, we have no known material environmental liabilities.




	Employees




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we employed 1,163 people, 1,116 of whom were based in the U.S. and 47 of whom were based in other countries. Of our domestic employees, 462 worked in the field and 654 worked at our corporate headquarters or our satellite office in California. Of these employees, 213, who are almost exclusively in marketing positions, were paid by certain of our advertising funds. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe our relationships with our employees are healthy.




	Our franchisees are independent business owners, so they and their employees are not included in our employee count.




	Intellectual property




	We own many registered trademarks and service marks (“Marks”) in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. We believe that our Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins names and logos, in particular, have significant value and are important to our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our Marks in the U.S. and selected international jurisdictions, monitor our Marks portfolio both internally and externally through external search agents and vigorously oppose the infringement of any of our Marks. We license the use of our registered Marks to franchisees and third parties through franchise arrangements and licenses. The franchise and license arrangements restrict franchisees’ and licensees’ activities with respect to the use of our Marks, and impose quality control standards in connection with goods and services offered in connection with the Marks and an affirmative obligation on the franchisees to notify us upon learning of potential infringement. In addition, we maintain a limited patent portfolio in the U.S. for bakery and serving-related methods, designs, and articles of manufacture. We generally rely on common law protection for our copyrighted works. Neither the patents nor the copyrighted works are material to the operation of our business. We also license some intellectual property from third parties for use in certain of our products. Such licenses are not individually, or in the aggregate, material to our business.




	Seasonality




	Our revenues are subject to fluctuations based on seasonality, primarily with respect to Baskin-Robbins. The ice cream industry generally experiences an increase during the spring and summer months, whereas Dunkin’ Donuts hot beverage sales generally increase during the fall and winter months and iced beverage sales generally increase during the spring and summer months.

	Item 1A.






	Risk Factors.







	Risks related to our business and industry




	Our financial results are affected by the operating results of our franchisees.




	We receive a substantial majority of our revenues in the form of royalties, which are generally based on a percentage of gross sales at franchised restaurants, rent, and other fees from franchisees. Accordingly, our financial results are to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. If sales trends or economic conditions worsen for franchisees, their financial results may deteriorate and our royalty, rent, and other revenues may decline and our accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts may increase. In addition, if our franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, our royalty revenues may decrease which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.




	Our franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.




	Our franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the operations, safety, and health standards set forth in our agreements with them. However, franchisees are independent third parties whom we do not control. The franchisees own, operate, and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants and have sole control over all employee and other workforce decisions. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any franchised restaurant rests with the franchisee. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, franchise fees paid to us and royalty income will be adversely affected and brand image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.




	Although we believe we generally enjoy a positive working relationship with the vast majority of our franchisees, active and/or potential disputes with franchisees could damage our brand reputation and/or our relationships with the broader franchisee group.









	Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands.




	Our success is dependent in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance the value of our brands, our customers’ connection to our brands, and a positive relationship with our franchisees. Brand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to the way we manage our relationship with our franchisees, our growth strategies, our development efforts in domestic and foreign markets, or the ordinary course of our, or our franchisees’, business. Other incidents may arise from events that are or may be beyond our ability to control and may damage our brands, such as actions taken (or not taken) by one or more franchisees or their employees relating to health, safety, welfare, or otherwise; litigation and claims; security breaches or other fraudulent activities associated with our electronic payment systems; and illegal activity targeted at us or others. Consumer demand for our products and our brands’ value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us or our products, which would likely result in lower sales and, ultimately, lower royalty income, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.




	Incidents involving food-borne illnesses, food tampering, or food contamination involving our brands or our supply chain could create negative publicity and significantly harm our operating results




	While we and our franchisees dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to enable customers to enjoy safe, quality food products, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli), have occurred in the food industry in the past, and could occur in the future.




	Instances or reports, whether true or not, of food-safety issues, such as food-borne illnesses, food tampering, food contamination or mislabeling, either during the growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing, or preparation of products, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the quick-service restaurant sectors and could affect us as well. Any report linking us, our franchisees, or our suppliers to food-borne illnesses or food tampering, contamination, mislabeling, or













	-


	 10


	-

















	other food-safety issues could damage the value of our brands immediately and severely hurt sales of our products and possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), or other damages.




	In addition, food safety incidents, whether or not involving our brands, could result in negative publicity for the industry or market segments in which we operate. Increased use of social media could create and/or amplify the effects of negative publicity. This negative publicity may reduce demand for our products and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants as consumers shift their preferences to our competitors or to other products or food types. A decrease in traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could materially and adversely affect our brands, our business, and our stock price.




	The quick service restaurant segment is highly competitive, and competition could lower our revenues.




	The QSR segment of the restaurant industry is intensely competitive. The beverage and food products sold by our franchisees compete directly against products sold at other QSRs, local and regional beverage and food operations, specialty beverage and food retailers, supermarkets, and wholesale suppliers, many bearing recognized brand names and having significant customer loyalty. In addition to the prevailing baseline level of competition, major market players in noncompeting industries may choose to enter the restaurant industry. Key competitive factors include the number and location of restaurants, quality and speed of service, attractiveness of facilities, effectiveness of advertising, marketing, and operational programs, price, demographic patterns and trends, consumer preferences and spending patterns, menu diversification, health or dietary preferences and perceptions, and new product development. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, which may provide them with a competitive advantage. In addition, we compete within the restaurant industry and the QSR segment not only for customers but also for qualified franchisees. We cannot guarantee the retention of any, including the top-performing, franchisees in the future, or that we will maintain the ability to attract, retain, and motivate sufficient numbers of franchisees of the same caliber, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. If we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience lower demand for products, downward pressure on prices, the loss of market share, and the inability to attract, or loss of, qualified franchisees, which could result in lower franchise fees and royalty income, and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.




	If we or our franchisees or licensees are unable to protect our customers


	’


	 credit card data and other personal information, we or our franchisees could be exposed to data loss, litigation, and liability, and our reputation could be significantly harmed.




	Data protection is increasingly demanding and the use of electronic payment methods and collection of other personal information exposes us and our franchisees to increased risk of privacy and/or security breaches as well as other risks. In connection with credit card transactions in-store and online, we and our franchisees collect and transmit confidential credit card information by way of retail networks. Additionally, we collect and store personal information from individuals, including our customers, franchisees, and employees. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools, and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmitting, and storing such information. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems, including through cyber terrorism, could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.




	Further, the standards for systems currently used for transmission and approval of electronic payment transactions, and the technology utilized in electronic payment themselves, all of which can put electronic payment data at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, not by us. In addition, our employees, franchisees, contractors, or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to misappropriate such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the personal information collected, stored, or transmitted by us or our franchisees, and our respective security measures, as well as those of our technology vendors, may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. Advances in computer and software capabilities and encryption technology, new tools, and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach. If a person is able to circumvent our data security measures or that of third parties with whom we do business, including our franchisees, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation and could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.









	Sub-franchisees could take actions that could harm our business and that of our master franchisees.




	In certain of our international markets, we enter into agreements with master franchisees that permit the master franchisee to develop and operate restaurants in defined geographic areas. As permitted by our master franchisee agreements, certain master franchisees elect to sub-franchise rights to develop and operate restaurants in the geographic area covered by the master franchisee agreement. Our master franchisee agreements contractually obligate our master franchisees to operate their













	-


	 11


	-

















	restaurants in accordance with specified operations, safety, and health standards and also require that any sub-franchise agreement contain similar requirements. However, we are not party to the agreements with the sub-franchisees and, as a result, are dependent upon our master franchisees to enforce these standards with respect to sub-franchised restaurants. As a result, the ultimate success and quality of any sub-franchised restaurant rests with the master franchisee. If sub-franchisees do not successfully operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with required standards, franchise fees and royalty income paid to the applicable master franchisee and, ultimately, to us could be adversely affected and our brand image and reputation may be harmed, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.




	We cannot predict the impact that the following may have on our business: (i) new or improved technologies, (ii) alternative methods of delivery, or (iii) changes in consumer behavior facilitated by these technologies and alternative methods of delivery.




	Advances in technologies or alternative methods of delivery, including advances in vending machine technology and home coffee makers, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery could have a negative effect on our business. Moreover, technology and consumer offerings continue to develop, and we expect that new or enhanced technologies and consumer offerings will be available in the future. We may pursue certain of those technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model. However, we cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business. In addition, our competitors, some of whom have greater resources than us, may be able to benefit from changes in technologies or consumer acceptance of alternative methods of delivery, which could harm our competitive position. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully respond to changing consumer preferences, including with respect to new technologies and alternative methods of delivery, or to effectively adjust our product mix, service offerings, and marketing and merchandising initiatives for products and services that address, and anticipate advances in, technology and market trends. If we are not able to successfully respond to these challenges, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed.




	Economic conditions adversely affecting consumer discretionary spending may negatively impact our business and operating results.




	We believe that our franchisees’ sales, customer traffic, and profitability are strongly correlated to consumer discretionary spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions, unemployment levels, and the availability of discretionary income. Our franchisees’ sales are dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers; any reduction in sales at franchised restaurants will result in lower royalty payments from franchisees to us and adversely impact our profitability. In an economic downturn our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the pace of new restaurant openings may be slowed and restaurants may be forced to close, reducing the restaurant base from which we derive royalty income. 




	Our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.




	We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had total indebtedness of approximately $2.5 billion under our securitized debt facility, excluding


	$25.9 million


	 of undrawn letters of credit and


	$74.1 million


	 of unused commitments.




	Subject to the limits contained in the agreements governing our securitized debt facility, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do incur substantial additional debt, the risks related to our high level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our high level of indebtedness could have important consequences, including:













	•






	limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, or other general corporate requirements;
















	•






	requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to payments to service our indebtedness instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;
















	•






	increasing our vulnerability to and the potential impact of adverse changes in general economic, industry, and competitive conditions;
















	•






	limiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;
















	•






	placing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors or competitors with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates; and
















	-


	 12


	-


























	•






	increasing our costs of borrowing. 







	In addition, the financial and other covenants we agreed to with our lenders may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make investments, and engage in other transactions, and the leverage may cause other potential lenders to be less willing to loan funds to us in the future.




	We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.




	Our ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, in the amounts projected or at all, or if future borrowings are not available to us under our variable funding notes in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled principal amortization and interest payments on our debt obligations in the future, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures, or seek additional equity investments. If we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to our indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all, our business may be harmed.




	The terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms and our failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default, which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects.




	Unless and until we repay all outstanding borrowings under our securitized debt facility, we will remain subject to the restrictive terms of these borrowings. The securitized debt facility, under which certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries issued and guaranteed fixed rate notes and variable funding notes, contain a number of covenants, with the most significant financial covenant being a debt service coverage calculation. These covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things:













	•






	sell assets;
















	•






	alter the business we conduct;
















	•






	engage in mergers, acquisitions, and other business combinations;
















	•






	declare dividends or redeem or repurchase capital stock;
















	•






	incur, assume, or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees;
















	•






	make loans and investments;
















	•






	incur liens; and
















	•






	enter into transactions with affiliates.







	The securitized debt facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy such a test. A breach of these covenants could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt facility. If amounts owed under the securitized debt facility are accelerated because of a default and we are unable to pay such amounts, the investors may have the right to assume control of substantially all of the securitized assets.




	If we are unable to refinance or repay amounts under the securitized debt facility prior to the expiration of the applicable term, our cash flow would be directed to the repayment of the securitized debt and, other than management fees sufficient to cover minimal selling, general and administrative expenses, would not be available for operating our business.




	No assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms. In addition, our access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and capital markets and other factors beyond our control. There can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing.













	-


	 13


	-

















	The indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events, cash flow would be further restricted.




	In the event that a rapid amortization event occurs under the indenture (including, without limitation, upon an event of default under the indenture or the failure to repay the securitized debt at the end of the applicable term), the funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business.




	Infringement, misappropriation, or dilution of our intellectual property could harm our business.




	We regard our Dunkin’ Donuts



	®



	 and Baskin-Robbins



	®



	 trademarks as having significant value and as being important factors in the marketing of our brands. We have also obtained trademark protection for the trademarks associated with several of our product offerings and advertising slogans, including “America Runs on Dunkin’



	®



	”. We believe that these and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, as well as copyright, patent, trademark, and other laws, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our intellectual property from infringement, misappropriation, or dilution. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks and have other trademark and service mark registration applications pending in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, not all of the trademarks or service marks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of those countries.




	Although we monitor trademark portfolios both internally and through external search agents and impose an obligation on franchisees to notify us upon learning of potential infringement, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately maintain, enforce, and protect our trademarks or other intellectual property rights. We are aware of names and marks similar to our service marks being used by other persons. Although we believe such uses will not adversely affect us, further or currently unknown unauthorized uses or other infringement of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and may adversely affect our business. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant or license our intellectual property. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could damage our brands and impair our ability to compete effectively. Even where we have effectively secured statutory protection for our trade secrets and other intellectual property, our competitors may misappropriate our intellectual property and our employees, consultants, and suppliers may breach their contractual obligations not to reveal our confidential information, including trade secrets. Although we have taken measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate or that third parties will not independently develop products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours. Despite our efforts, it may be possible for third-parties to reverse engineer, otherwise obtain, copy, and use information that we regard as proprietary. Furthermore, defending or enforcing our trademark rights, branding practices, and other intellectual property, and seeking an injunction and/or compensation for misappropriation of confidential information, could result in the expenditure of significant resources and divert the attention of management, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.




	Our brands may be limited or diluted through franchisee and third-party activity.




	Although we monitor and restrict franchisee activities through our franchise and license agreements, franchisees or third parties may refer to or make statements about our brands that do not make proper use of our trademarks or required designations, that improperly alter trademarks or branding, or that are critical of our brands or place our brands in a context that may tarnish their reputation. This may result in dilution or tarnishment of our intellectual property. It is not possible for us to obtain registrations for all possible variations of our branding in all territories where we operate. Franchisees, licensees, or third parties may seek to register or obtain registration for domain names and trademarks involving localizations, variations, and versions of certain branding tools, and these activities may limit our ability to obtain or use such rights in such territories. Franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise or license agreements may reduce the overall goodwill of our brands, whether through the failure to meet health and safety standards, engage in quality control or maintain product consistency, or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices.




	Moreover, unauthorized third parties may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our brands, resulting in consumer confusion or dilution. Any reduction of our brands’ goodwill, consumer confusion, or dilution is likely to impact sales, and could materially and adversely impact our business and operating results.




	We are and may become subject to third-party infringement claims or challenges to the validity of our intellectual property


	.




	We are and may, in the future, become the subject of claims for infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of intellectual property rights, which may or not be unfounded, from owners of intellectual property in areas where our franchisees operate or where we intend to conduct operations, including in foreign jurisdictions. Such claims could harm our image, our brands, our competitive position, or our ability to expand our operations into other jurisdictions and cause us to incur significant costs related to defense or settlement. If such claims were decided against us, or a third party indemnified by us pursuant to license terms, we













	-


	 14


	-

















	could be required to pay damages, develop or adopt non


	-


	infringing products or services, or acquire a license to the intellectual property that is the subject of the asserted claim, which license may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. The attendant expenses could require the expenditure of additional capital, and there would be expenses associated with the defense of any infringement, misappropriation, or other third-party claims, and there could be attendant negative publicity, even if ultimately decided in our favor.




	Growth into new territories may be hindered or blocked by pre-existing third-party rights.




	We act to obtain and protect our intellectual property rights we need to operate successfully in those territories where we operate. Certain intellectual property rights including rights in trademarks are national in character, and are obtained on a country-by-country basis by the first person to obtain protection through use or registration in that country in connection with specified products and services. As our business grows, we continuously evaluate the potential for expansion into new territories and new products and services. There is a risk with each expansion that growth will be limited or unavailable due to blocking pre-existing third-party intellectual property rights.




	The restaurant industry is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions. Changes in these preferences and perceptions may lessen the demand for our products, which could reduce sales by our franchisees and reduce our royalty revenues.




	The restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional, and local economic conditions, and demographic trends. For instance, if prevailing health or dietary preferences cause consumers to avoid donuts and other products we offer in favor of foods that are perceived as healthier, our franchisees’ sales would suffer, resulting in lower royalty payments to us, and our business and operating results would be harmed.




	If we fail to successfully implement our growth strategy, which includes opening new domestic and international restaurants, our ability to increase our revenues and operating profits could be adversely affected.




	Our growth strategy relies in part upon new restaurant development by existing and new franchisees. We and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new restaurants, including:













	•






	availability of financing;
















	•






	selection and availability of suitable restaurant locations;
















	•






	competition for restaurant sites;
















	•






	negotiation of acceptable lease and financing terms;
















	•






	securing required domestic or foreign governmental permits and approvals;
















	•






	consumer tastes in new geographic regions and acceptance of our products;
















	•






	employment and training of qualified personnel;
















	•






	impact of inclement weather, natural disasters, and other acts of nature; and
















	•






	general economic and business conditions.







	In particular, because the majority of our new restaurant development is funded by franchisee investment, our growth strategy is dependent on our franchisees’ (or prospective franchisees’) ability to access funds to finance such development. We do not provide our franchisees with direct financing and therefore their ability to access borrowed funds generally depends on their independent relationships with various financial institutions. If our franchisees (or prospective franchisees) are not able to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, they may be unwilling or unable to invest in the development of new restaurants, and our future growth could be adversely affected.




	To the extent our franchisees are unable to open new restaurants as we anticipate, our revenue growth would come primarily from growth in comparable store sales. Our failure to add a significant number of new restaurants or grow comparable store sales would adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues and operating income and could materially and adversely harm our business and operating results. 




	Increases in commodity prices may negatively affect payments from our franchisees and licensees.




	Coffee and other commodity prices are subject to substantial price fluctuations, stemming from variations in weather patterns, shifting political or economic conditions in coffee-producing countries, potential taxes or fees on certain imported goods, and delays in the supply chain. If commodity prices rise, franchisees may experience reduced sales, due to decreased consumer demand at retail prices that have been raised to offset increased commodity prices, which may reduce franchisee profitability.

	Any such decline in franchisee sales will reduce our royalty income, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.









	Our joint ventures in Japan and South Korea, as well as our licensees in Russia and India, manufacture ice cream products independently. The joint ventures in Japan and South Korea each own a manufacturing facility in its country of operation. The revenues derived from these joint ventures differ fundamentally from those of other types of franchise arrangements in the system because the income that we receive from the joint ventures in Japan and South Korea is based in part on the profitability, rather than the gross sales, of the restaurants operated by these joint ventures. Accordingly, in the event that the joint ventures in Japan or South Korea experience staple ingredient price increases that adversely affect the profitability of the restaurants operated by these joint ventures, that decrease in profitability would reduce distributions by these joint ventures to us, which in turn could materially and adversely impact our business and operating results.









	Shortages of coffee or milk could adversely affect our revenues.




	If coffee or milk consumption continues to increase worldwide or there is a disruption in the supply of coffee or milk due to natural disasters, political unrest, or other calamities, the global supply of these commodities may fail to meet demand. If coffee or milk demand is not met, franchisees may experience reduced sales which, in turn, would reduce our royalty income. Additionally, if milk demand is not met, we may not be able to purchase and distribute ice cream products to our international franchisees, which would reduce our sales of ice cream and other products. Such reductions in our royalty income and sales of ice cream and other products may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.




	We and our franchisees rely on information technology and computer systems to process transactions and manage our business, and a disruption or a failure of such systems or technology could harm our ability to effectively manage our business.




	Network and information technology systems are integral to our business. We utilize various computer systems, including our FAST System and our EFTPay System, which are customized, web-based systems. The FAST System is the system by which our U.S. and Canadian franchisees report their weekly sales and pay their corresponding royalty fees and required advertising fund contributions. When sales are reported by a U.S. or Canadian franchisee, a withdrawal for the authorized amount is initiated from the franchisee’s bank after 12 days (from the week ending or month ending date). The FAST System is critical to our ability to accurately track sales and compute royalties due from our U.S. and Canadian franchisees. The EFTPay System is used by our U.S. and Canadian franchisees to make payments against open, non-fee invoices (i.e., all invoices except royalty and advertising funds). When a franchisee selects an invoice and submits the payment, on the following day a withdrawal for the selected amount is initiated from the franchisee’s bank. Additionally, an increasing number of transactions in our restaurants are processed through our mobile application. Despite the implementation of security measures, our systems are subject to damage and/or interruption as a result of power outages, computer and network failures, computer viruses and other disruptive software, security breaches, terrorist attacks, catastrophic events, and improper usage by employees. Such events could result in a material disruption in operations, a need for a costly repair, upgrade, or replacement of systems, or a decrease in, or in the collection of, royalties paid to us by our franchisees. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability which could materially affect our results of operations.









	Interruptions in the supply of product to franchisees and licensees could adversely affect our revenues.




	In order to maintain quality-control standards and consistency among restaurants, we require through our franchise agreements that our franchisees obtain food and other supplies from preferred suppliers approved in advance. In this regard, we and our franchisees depend on a group of suppliers for ingredients, foodstuffs, beverages, and disposable serving instruments including, but not limited to, Rich Products Corp., Dean Foods Co., The Coca-Cola Company, and Silver Pail Dairy, Ltd. as well as four primary coffee roasters and two primary donut mix suppliers. In 2016, we and our franchisees purchased products from nearly 600 approved domestic suppliers, with approximately 13 of such suppliers providing half, based on dollar volume, of all products purchased domestically. We look to approve multiple suppliers for most products, and require any single sourced supplier, such as The Coca-Cola Company, to have contingency plans in place to ensure continuity of supply. In addition we believe that, if necessary, we could obtain readily available alternative sources of supply for each product that we currently source through a single supplier. To facilitate the efficiency of our franchisees’ supply chain, we have historically entered into several preferred-supplier arrangements for particular food or beverage items.




	The Dunkin’ Donuts system is supported domestically by the franchisee-owned purchasing and distribution cooperative known as the National Distributor Commitment Program. We have a long-term agreement with the National DCP, LLC (the “NDCP”) for the NDCP to provide substantially all of the goods needed to operate a Dunkin’ Donuts restaurant in the United States. The NDCP also supplies some international markets. The NDCP aggregates the franchisee demand, sends requests for proposals to













	-


	 16


	-

















	approved suppliers, and negotiates contracts for approved items. The NDCP also inventories the items in its seven regional distribution centers and ships products to franchisees at least one time per week. We do not control the NDCP and have only limited contractual rights under our agreement with the NDCP associated with supplier certification and quality assurance and protection of our intellectual property. While the NDCP maintains contingency plans with its approved suppliers and has a contingency plan for its own distribution function to restaurants, our franchisees bear risks associated with the timeliness, solvency, reputation, labor relations, freight costs, price of raw materials, and compliance with health and safety standards of each supplier (including those of our international joint ventures) including, but not limited to, risks associated with contamination to food and beverage products. We have little control over such suppliers. Disruptions in these relationships may reduce franchisee sales and, in turn, our royalty income.




	Overall difficulty of suppliers (including those of certain international joint ventures) meeting franchisee product demand, interruptions in the supply chain, obstacles or delays in the process of renegotiating or renewing agreements with preferred suppliers, financial difficulties experienced by suppliers, or the deficiency, lack, or poor quality of alternative suppliers could adversely impact franchisee sales which, in turn, would reduce our royalty income and could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.









	We may not be able to recoup our expenditures on properties we sublease to franchisees.




	In some locations, we may pay more rent and other amounts to third-party landlords under a prime lease than we receive from the franchisee who subleases such property. Typically, our franchisees’ rent is based in part on a percentage of gross sales at the restaurant, so a downturn in gross sales would negatively affect the level of the payments we receive. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of certain prime leases we have entered into with third-party landlords, we may be required to construct or improve a property, pay taxes, maintain insurance, and comply with building codes and other applicable laws. The subleases we enter into with franchisees related to such properties typically pass through such obligations, but if a franchisee fails to perform the obligations passed through to them, we will be required to perform those obligations, resulting in an increase in our leasing and operational costs and expenses.




	If the international markets in which we compete are affected by changes in political, social, legal, economic, or other factors, our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had 8,714 international restaurants located in


	67


	 foreign countries. The international operations of our franchisees may subject us to additional risks, which differ in each country in which our franchisees operate, and such risks may negatively affect our business or result in a delay in or loss of royalty income to us.




	The factors impacting the international markets in which restaurants are located may include:













	•






	recessionary or expansive trends in international markets;
















	•






	changes in foreign currency exchange rates and hyperinflation or deflation in the foreign countries in which we or our international joint ventures operate;
















	•






	the imposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;
















	•






	availability of credit for our franchisees, licensees, and our international joint ventures to finance the development of new restaurants;
















	•






	increases in the taxes paid and other changes in applicable tax laws;
















	•






	legal and regulatory changes and the burdens and costs of local operators’ compliance with a variety of laws, including trade restrictions and tariffs;
















	•






	interruption of the supply of product;
















	•






	increases in anti-American sentiment and the identification of the Dunkin’ Donuts brand and Baskin-Robbins brand as American brands;
















	•






	political and economic instability; and
















	•






	natural disasters, terrorist threats and/or activities, and other calamities.







	Any or all of these factors may reduce distributions from our international joint ventures or other international partners and/or royalty income, which in turn may materially and adversely impact our business and operating results.




	Termination of an arrangement with a master franchisee could adversely impact our revenues.




	Internationally, and in limited cases domestically, we enter into relationships with “master franchisees” to develop and operate













	-


	 17


	-

















	restaurants in defined geographic areas. Master franchisees are granted exclusivity rights with respect to larger territories than the typical franchisees, and in particular cases, expansion after minimum requirements are met is subject to the discretion of the master franchisee. In fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, we derived approximately 14.6%, 14.8%, and 15.7%, respectively, of our total revenues from master franchisee arrangements. The termination of an arrangement with a master franchisee or a lack of expansion by certain master franchisees could result in the delay of the development of franchised restaurants, or an interruption in the operation of one of our brands in a particular market or markets. Any such delay or interruption would result in a delay in, or loss of, royalty income to us whether by way of delayed royalty income or delayed revenues from the sale of ice cream and other products by us to franchisees internationally, or reduced sales. Any interruption in operations due to the termination of an arrangement with a master franchisee similarly could result in lower revenues for us, particularly if we were to determine to close restaurants following the termination of an arrangement with a master franchisee.




	Fluctuations in exchange rates affect our revenues.




	We are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy. Most of our revenues, costs, and debts are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, sales made by franchisees outside of the U.S. are denominated in the currency of the country in which the point of distribution is located, and this currency could become less valuable prior to calculation of our royalty payments in U.S. dollars as a result of exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, currency fluctuations could reduce our royalty income. Unfavorable currency fluctuations could result in a reduction in our revenues. Income we earn from our joint ventures is also subject to currency fluctuations. These currency fluctuations affecting our revenues and costs could adversely affect our business and operating results.




	Adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, whether or not accurate, could harm our brands and our business.




	Some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar, other carbohydrates, fats, and other active compounds, the health effects of which are the subject of increasing public scrutiny, including the suggestion that excessive consumption of caffeine, dairy products, sugar, other carbohydrates, fats, and other active compounds can lead to a variety of adverse health effects. There has also been greater public awareness that sedentary lifestyles, combined with excessive consumption of high- carbohydrate, high-fat, or high-calorie foods, have led to a rapidly rising rate of obesity. In the United States and certain other countries, there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food products. While we offer some healthier beverage and food items, including reduced fat items and reduced sugar items, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, or negative publicity or litigation arising from other health risks such as obesity, could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could materially and adversely affect our brands and our business.




	We may not be able to enforce payment of fees under certain of our franchise arrangements.




	In certain limited instances, a franchisee may be operating a restaurant pursuant to an unwritten franchise arrangement. Such circumstances may arise where a franchisee arrangement has expired and new or renewal agreements have yet to be executed or where the franchisee has developed and opened a restaurant but has failed to memorialize the franchisor-franchisee relationship in an executed agreement as of the opening date of such restaurant. In certain other limited instances, we may allow a franchisee in good standing to operate domestically pursuant to franchise arrangements which have expired in their normal course and have not yet been renewed. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, less than 1% of our restaurants were operating without a written agreement. There is a risk that either category of these franchise arrangements may not be enforceable under federal, state, or local laws and regulations prior to correction or if left uncorrected. In these instances, the franchise arrangements may be enforceable on the basis of custom and assent of performance. If the franchisee, however, were to neglect to remit royalty payments in a timely fashion, we may be unable to enforce the payment of such fees which, in turn, may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. While we generally require franchise arrangements in foreign jurisdictions to be entered into pursuant to written franchise arrangements, subject to certain exceptions, some expired contracts, letters of intent, or oral agreements in existence may not be enforceable under local laws, which could impair our ability to collect royalty income, which in turn may materially and adversely impact our business and operating results.




	Our business activities subject us to litigation risk that could affect us adversely by subjecting us to significant money damages and other remedies or by increasing our litigation expense.




	In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of complaints or litigation from franchisees, usually related to alleged breaches of contract or wrongful termination under the franchise arrangements. In addition, we are, from time to time, the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging illness, injury, or other food-quality, health, or operational concerns and from suppliers alleging breach of contract. We may also be subject to employee claims based on, among other things,













	-


	 18


	-

















	discrimination, harassment, or wrongful termination. Finally, litigation against a franchisee or its affiliates by third parties, whether in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, may include claims against us by virtue of our relationship with the defendant-franchisee. In addition to decreasing the ability of a defendant-franchisee to make royalty payments and diverting management resources, adverse publicity resulting from such allegations may materially and adversely affect us and our brands, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable. Our international operations may be subject to additional risks related to litigation, including difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations governed by foreign law due to differing interpretations of rights and obligations, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, new and potentially untested laws and judicial systems, and reduced or diminished protection of intellectual property. A substantial unsatisfied judgment against us or one of our subsidiaries could result in bankruptcy, which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. 




	Our business is subject to various laws and regulations and changes in such laws and regulations, and/or failure to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, could adversely affect us.




	We are subject to state franchise registration requirements, the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises in the United States through the provision of franchise disclosure documents containing certain mandatory disclosures, and certain rules and requirements regulating franchising arrangements in foreign countries. Although we believe that the Franchisors’ Franchise Disclosure Documents, together with any applicable state-specific versions or supplements, and franchising procedures that we use comply in all material respects with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we offer new franchise arrangements, noncompliance could reduce anticipated royalty income, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.




	Our franchisees are subject to various existing U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign laws affecting the operation of the restaurants including various health, sanitation, fire, and safety standards. Franchisees may in the future become subject to regulation (or further regulation) seeking to tax or regulate high-fat foods, to limit the serving size of beverages containing sugar, to ban the use of certain packaging materials (including polystyrene used in the iconic Dunkin’ Donuts cup), or requiring the display of detailed nutrition information. Each of these regulations would be costly to comply with and/or could result in reduced demand for our products.




	In connection with the continued operation or remodeling of certain restaurants, franchisees may be required to expend funds to meet U.S. federal, state, and local and foreign regulations. Difficulties in obtaining, or the failure to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant in a particular area or cause an existing restaurant to cease operations. All of these situations would decrease sales of an affected restaurant and reduce royalty payments to us with respect to such restaurant.




	The franchisees are also subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, and various other laws in the United States and in foreign countries governing such matters as minimum-wage requirements, overtime and other working conditions, and citizenship requirements. A significant number of our franchisees’ food-service employees are paid at rates related to the U.S. federal minimum wage and applicable minimum wages in foreign jurisdictions and past increases in the U.S. federal minimum wage and foreign jurisdiction minimum wage have increased labor costs, as would future such increases. Any increases in labor costs might result in franchisees inadequately staffing restaurants. Understaffed restaurants could reduce sales at such restaurants, decrease royalty payments, and adversely affect our brands. Evolving labor and employment laws, rules, and regulations could also result in increased exposure on the part of Dunkin’ Brands’ for labor and employment related liabilities that have historically been borne by franchisees.




	Our and our franchisees’ operations and properties are subject to extensive U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental, building, and zoning requirements. Our development of properties for leasing or subleasing to franchisees depends to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic, and other regulations and requirements. Failure to comply with legal requirements could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines, and civil and criminal liability. We may incur investigation, remediation, or other costs related to releases of hazardous materials or other environmental conditions at our properties, regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or a third party, such as a prior owner or tenant. We have incurred costs to address soil and groundwater contamination at some sites, and continue to incur nominal remediation costs at some of our other locations. If such issues become more expensive to address, or if new issues arise, they could increase our expenses, generate negative publicity, or otherwise adversely affect us.




	We are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchisees.




	Our franchise system subjects us to a number of additional risks, any one of which may impact our ability to collect royalty payments from our franchisees, may harm the goodwill associated with our brands, and/or may materially and adversely impact













	-


	 19


	-

















	our business and results of operations.




	Bankruptcy of U.S. Franchisees.


	 A franchisee bankruptcy could have a substantial negative impact on our ability to collect payments due under such franchisee’s franchise arrangements and, to the extent such franchisee is a lessee pursuant to a franchisee lease/sublease with us, payments due under such franchisee lease/sublease. In a franchisee bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may reject its franchise arrangements and/or franchisee lease/sublease pursuant to Section 365 under the United States bankruptcy code, in which case there would be no further royalty payments and/or franchisee lease/sublease payments from such franchisee, and there can be no assurance as to the proceeds, if any, that may ultimately be recovered in a bankruptcy proceeding of such franchisee in connection with a damage claim resulting from such rejection.




	Franchisee Changes in Control.


	 The franchise arrangements prohibit “changes in control” of a franchisee without our consent as the franchisor, except in the event of the death or disability of a franchisee (if a natural person) or a principal of a franchisee entity. In such event, the executors and representatives of the franchisee are required to transfer the relevant franchise arrangements to a successor franchisee approved by the franchisor. There can be, however, no assurance that any such successor would be found or, if found, would be able to perform the former franchisee’s obligations under such franchise arrangements or successfully operate the restaurant. If a successor franchisee is not found, or if the successor franchisee that is found is not as successful in operating the restaurant as the then-deceased or disabled franchisee or franchisee principal, the sales of the restaurant could be adversely affected.




	Franchisee Insurance.


	 The franchise arrangements require each franchisee to maintain certain insurance types and levels. Certain extraordinary hazards, however, may not be covered, and insurance may not be available (or may be available only at prohibitively expensive rates) with respect to many other risks. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits and policy payments made to franchisees may not be made on a timely basis. Any such loss or delay in payment could have a material and adverse effect on a franchisee’s ability to satisfy its obligations under its franchise arrangement, including its ability to make royalty payments.




	Some of Our Franchisees are Operating Entities.


	 Franchisees may be natural persons or legal entities. Our franchisees that are operating companies (as opposed to limited purpose entities) are subject to business, credit, financial, and other risks, which may be unrelated to the operations of the restaurants. These unrelated risks could materially and adversely affect a franchisee that is an operating company and its ability to make its royalty payments in full or on a timely basis, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.




	Franchise Arrangement Termination; Nonrenewal.


	 Each franchise arrangement is subject to termination by us as the franchisor in the event of a default, generally after expiration of applicable cure periods, although under certain circumstances a franchise arrangement may be terminated by us upon notice without an opportunity to cure. The default provisions under the franchise arrangements are drafted broadly and include, among other things, any failure to meet operating standards and actions that may threaten our licensed intellectual property.




	In addition, each franchise agreement has an expiration date. Upon the expiration of the franchise arrangement, we or the franchisee may, or may not, elect to renew the franchise arrangements. If the franchisee arrangement is renewed, the franchisee will receive a “successor” franchise arrangement for an additional term. Such option, however, is contingent on the franchisee’s execution of the then-current form of franchise arrangements (which may include increased royalty payments, advertising fees, and other costs), the satisfaction of certain conditions (including modernization of the restaurant and related operations), and the payment of a renewal fee. If a franchisee is unable or unwilling to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions, the expiring franchise arrangements will terminate upon expiration of the term of the franchise arrangements.




	Product Liability Exposure.


	 We require franchisees to maintain general liability insurance coverage to protect against the risk of product liability and other risks and demand strict franchisee compliance with health and safety regulations. However, franchisees may receive through the supply chain (from central manufacturing locations (“CMLs”), NDCP, or otherwise), or produce defective food or beverage products, which may adversely impact our brands’ goodwill.




	Americans with Disabilities Act.


	 Restaurants located in the United States must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended (the “ADA”). Although we believe newer restaurants meet the ADA construction standards and, further, that franchisees have historically been diligent in the remodeling of older restaurants, a finding of noncompliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, an award of damages to private litigants, or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. Any imposition of injunctive relief, fines, damage awards, or capital expenditures could adversely affect the ability of a franchisee to make royalty payments, or could generate negative publicity, or otherwise adversely affect us.




	Franchisee Litigation.


	 Franchisees are subject to a variety of litigation risks, including, but not limited to, customer claims, personal-injury claims, environmental claims, employee allegations of improper termination and discrimination, claims related to violations of the ADA, religious freedom, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and intellectual-property claims. Each of these claims may increase costs and limit the funds













	-


	 20


	-

















	available to make royalty payments and reduce the execution of new franchise arrangements.




	Potential Conflicts with Franchisee Organizations


	. Although we believe our relationship with our franchisees is open and strong, the nature of the franchisor-franchisee relationship can give rise to conflict. In the U.S., our approach is collaborative in that we have established district advisory councils, regional advisory councils, and a national brand advisory council for each of the Dunkin’ Donuts brand and the Baskin-Robbins brand. The councils are comprised of franchisees, brand employees, and executives, and they meet to discuss the strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities facing the brands as well as the rollout of new products and projects. Internationally, our operations are primarily conducted through joint ventures with local licensees, so our relationships are conducted directly with our licensees rather than separate advisory committees. No material disputes with franchisee organizations exist in the United States or internationally at this time.




	Failure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain new qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.




	Our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our executive management team and the ability of other key management personnel to replace executives who retire or resign. We may not be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management personnel to replace executives who retire or resign. Failure to retain our leadership team and attract and retain other important personnel could lead to ineffective management and operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.









	Unforeseen weather or other events, including terrorist threats or activities, may disrupt our business.




	Unforeseen events, including war, terrorism, and other international, regional, or local instability or conflicts (including labor issues), embargos, public health issues (including tainted food, food-borne illnesses, food tampering, or water supply or widespread/pandemic illness such as Ebola, the avian or H1N1 flu, MERS), and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, or other adverse weather and climate conditions, whether occurring in the U.S. or abroad, could disrupt our operations or that of our franchisees or suppliers; or result in political or economic instability. These events could reduce traffic in our restaurants and demand for our products; make it difficult or impossible for our franchisees to receive products from their suppliers; disrupt or prevent our ability to perform functions at the corporate level; and/or otherwise impede our or our franchisees’ ability to continue business operations in a continuous manner consistent with the level and extent of business activities prior to the occurrence of the unexpected event or events, which in turn may materially and adversely impact our business and operating results.









	Risks related to our common stock









	Our stock price could be extremely volatile and, as a result, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.




	Since our initial public offering in July 2011, the price of our common stock, as reported by NASDAQ, has ranged from a low of $23.24 on December 15, 2011 to a high of $56.79 on July 14, 2015. In addition, the stock market in general has been highly volatile. As a result, the market price of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile, and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their stock, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, and could lose part or all of their investment. The price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including those described elsewhere in this report and others such as:













	•






	variations in our operating performance and the performance of our competitors;
















	•






	actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;
















	•






	publication of research reports by securities analysts about us, our competitors, or our industry;
















	•






	our failure or the failure of our competitors to meet analysts’ projections or guidance that we or our competitors may give to the market;
















	•






	additions and departures of key personnel;
















	•






	strategic decisions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments, or changes in business strategy;
















	•






	the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments affecting us or our industry;
















	•






	speculation in the press or investment community;
















	-


	 21


	-


























	•






	changes in accounting principles;
















	•






	terrorist acts, acts of war, or periods of widespread civil unrest;
















	•






	natural disasters and other calamities; and
















	•






	changes in general market and economic conditions.







	As we operate in a single industry, we are especially vulnerable to these factors to the extent that they affect our industry, our products, or to a lesser extent our markets. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention and resources, and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation.




	Provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may deter takeover efforts that you feel would be beneficial to stockholder value.




	Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions which could make it harder for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include a classified board of directors and limitations on actions by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval that could be used to dilute a potential hostile acquirer. Our certificate of incorporation also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and a holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. As a result, you may lose your ability to sell your stock for a price in excess of the prevailing market price due to these protective measures, and efforts by stockholders to change the direction or management of the company may be unsuccessful.

	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we owned 96 properties and leased 963 locations across the U.S. and Canada, a majority of which we leased or subleased to franchisees. For fiscal year 2016, we generated 12.2%, or $101.0 million, of our total revenue from rental fees from franchisees who lease or sublease their properties from us.




	The remaining balance of restaurants selling our products are situated on real property owned by franchisees or leased directly by franchisees from third-party landlords. All international restaurants (other than 11 located in Canada) are situated on real property owned by licensees and their sub-franchisees or leased by licensees and their sub-franchisees directly from a third-party landlord.

	Combination restaurants, as more fully described below, count as both a Dunkin’ Donuts and a Baskin-Robbins point of distribution.









	Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins restaurants operate in a variety of formats. Dunkin’ Donuts traditional restaurant formats include free standing restaurants, end-caps (i.e., end location of a larger multi-store building), and gas and convenience locations. A free-standing building typically ranges in size from 1,200 to 2,500 square feet, and may include a drive-thru window. An end-cap typically ranges in size from 1,000 to 2,000 square feet and may include a drive-thru window. Dunkin’ Donuts also has other restaurants designed to fit anywhere, consisting of small full-service restaurants and/or self-serve kiosks in offices, hospitals, colleges, airports, grocery stores, wholesale clubs, and drive-thru-only units on smaller pieces of property (collectively referred to as alternative points of distributions or “APODs”). APODs typically range in size between 400 to 1,800 square feet. The majority of our Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants have their fresh baked goods delivered to them from franchisee-owned and -operated CMLs.




	Baskin-Robbins traditional restaurant formats include free standing restaurants and end-caps. A free-standing building typically ranges in size from 600 to 1,200 square feet, and may include a drive-thru window. An end-cap typically ranges in size from 800 to 1,200 square feet and may include a drive-thru window. We also have other restaurants, consisting of small full-service restaurants and/or self-serve kiosks (collectively referred to as APODs). APODs typically range in size between 400 to 1,000 square feet.




	In the U.S., Baskin-Robbins can also be found in 1,265 combination restaurants (“combos”) that also include a Dunkin’ Donuts restaurant, and are typically either free-standing or an end-cap. These combos, which we count as both a Dunkin’ Donuts and a Baskin-Robbins point of distribution, typically range from 1,400 to 3,500 square feet.




	Of the 11,366 U.S. locations, 92 were sites owned by the Company and leased to franchisees, 932 were leased by us, and in turn, subleased to franchisees, with the remainder either owned or leased directly by the franchisee. Our land or land and building leases are generally for terms of ten years to twenty years, and often have one or more five-year or ten-year renewal options. In certain lease agreements, we have the option to purchase, or the right of first refusal to purchase, the real estate. Certain leases require the payment of additional rent equal to a percentage of annual sales in excess of specified amounts.




	Of the sites owned or leased by the Company in the U.S., 15 are locations that no longer have a Dunkin’ Donuts or Baskin-Robbins restaurant (“surplus properties”). Some of these surplus properties have been sublet to other parties while the remaining are currently vacant.




	We also have leased office space in Brazil, China, Dubai, and the United Kingdom.

	On

	, we announced that our board of directors approved an increase to the next quarterly dividend to


	$0.3225


	 per share of common stock payable on


	March 22, 2017


	.









	We currently anticipate continuing the payment of quarterly cash dividends. The actual amount of such dividends will depend upon future earnings, results of operations, capital requirements, our financial condition, and certain other factors. There can be no assurance as to the amount of free cash flow that we will generate in future years and, accordingly, dividends will be considered after reviewing returns to shareholders, profitability expectations, and financing needs and will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors.

	Fiscal year 2012 includes a $20.7 million incremental legal reserve recorded in the second quarter related to the Quebec Superior Court’s ruling in the Bertico litigation, in which the Court found for the Plaintiffs and issued a judgment against Dunkin’ Brands in the amount of approximately C$16.4 million, plus costs and interest. Fiscal year 2015 includes a net reduction to legal reserves for the Bertico litigation and related matters of $2.8 million, as a result of the Quebec Court of Appeals (Montreal) ruling to reduce the damages assessed against the Company in the Bertico litigation from approximately C$16.4 million to approximately C$10.9 million, plus costs and interest. Fiscal year 2016 includes a net reduction to legal reserves for the Bertico litigation and related matters of $428 thousand based upon final agreement of interest and related costs associated with the judgment.

	Adjusted operating income and adjusted net income are non-GAAP measures reflecting operating income and net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, long-lived asset impairments, impairment of joint ventures, and other non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual charges, net of the tax impact of such adjustments in the case of adjusted net income. The Company uses adjusted operating income and adjusted net income as key performance measures for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. We also believe adjusted operating income and adjusted net income provide our investors with useful information regarding our historical operating results. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Use of the terms adjusted operating income and adjusted net income may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. Adjusted operating income and adjusted net income are reconciled from operating income and net income, respectively, determined under GAAP as follows:

The amount for fiscal year 2012 also reflects the one-time delay in revenue recognition, net of related cost of ice cream and other products, related to the shift in manufacturing to Dean Foods of $2.1 million. For fiscal year 2013, the adjustment represents transition-related general and administrative costs incurred related to the plant closure, such as

	Amount consists of an other-than-temporary impairment of the investment in the Japan joint venture of $54.3 million, less a reduction in depreciation and amortization of $0.4 million resulting from the allocation of the impairment charge to the underlying long-lived assets of the joint venture.
















	(d)






	For fiscal year 2012, the adjustment represents the incremental legal reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2012 related to the Quebec Superior Court’s ruling in the Bertico litigation, in which the Court found for the Plaintiffs and issued a judgment against Dunkin’ Brands in the amount of approximately C$16.4 million (approximately $15.9 million), plus costs and interest. The adjustment for fiscal year 2015 represents the net reduction to legal reserves for the Bertico litigation and related matters of $2.8 million, as a result of the Quebec Court of Appeals (Montreal) ruling to reduce the damages assessed against the Company in the Bertico litigation from approximately C$16.4 million to approximately C$10.9 million, plus costs and interest. The adjustment for the fiscal year 2016 represents a net reduction to legal reserves for the Bertico litigation and related matters of $428 thousand based upon final agreement of interest and related costs associated with the judgment.

	Adjusted operating income includes the impact of the 53rd week for fiscal year 2016. Based on our estimate of that extra week on certain revenues and expenses, the impact of the extra week in fiscal year 2016 on adjusted operating income was approximately $6.1 million. Excluding the impact of the extra week, adjusted operating income for fiscal year 2016 would have been approximately $430.5 million on a 52-week basis.

	Systemwide sales include sales at franchisee- and company-operated restaurants, including joint ventures. While we do not record sales by franchisees, licensees, or joint ventures as revenue, and such sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements, we believe that this operating measure is important in obtaining an understanding of our financial performance. We believe systemwide sales information aids in understanding how we derive royalty revenue and in evaluating our performance relative to competitors. Beginning in the fiscal year 2016, we began presenting systemwide sales rather than franchisee-reported sales, which excluded sales of company-operated restaurants, as we believe the systemwide sales information is a more complete metric in obtaining an understanding of our financial performance. Additionally, systemwide sales related to restaurants located in Puerto Rico were previously included in the Dunkin' Donuts International and Baskin-Robbins International segments, but are now included in the Dunkin' Donuts U.S. and Baskin-Robbins U.S. segments based on functional responsibility for all years presented.

	Systemwide sales growth represents the percentage change in systemwide sales from the comparable period of the prior year. Changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in average comparable store sales and changes in the number of restaurants. Percentage change in systemwide sales for all prior years presented was revised for systemwide sales related to restaurants located in Puerto Rico that were previously included in the Dunkin' Donuts International and Baskin-Robbins International segments, but are now included in the Dunkin' Donuts U.S. and Baskin-Robbins U.S. segments based on functional responsibility.

	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.







	The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our markets, the demand for our products and services and our future results and involves numerous risks and uncertainties. Generally these statements can be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “feel,” “forecast,” “intend,” “may,” “plan,” “potential,” “project,” “should” or “would” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied by the forward-looking statement. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and currently available data and are neither predictions nor guarantees of future events or performance. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. See “Risk factors” for a discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.








	Introduction and overview




	We are one of the world’s leading franchisors of quick service restaurants (“QSRs”) serving hot and cold coffee and baked goods, as well as hard serve ice cream. We franchise restaurants under our Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins brands. With over 20,000 points of distribution in more than 60 countries worldwide, we believe that our portfolio has strong brand awareness in our key markets. QSR is a restaurant format characterized by counter or drive-thru ordering and limited or no table service. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, Dunkin’ Donuts had


	12,258


	 global points of distribution with restaurants in 41 U.S. states and the District of Columbia and in 44 foreign countries. Baskin-Robbins had


	7,822


	 global points of distribution as of the same date, with restaurants in 43 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and in 51 foreign countries.




	We are organized into four reporting segments: Dunkin’ Donuts U.S., Dunkin’ Donuts International, Baskin-Robbins U.S., and Baskin-Robbins International. We generate revenue from four primary sources: (i) royalty income and franchise fees associated with franchised restaurants, (ii) rental income from restaurant properties that we lease or sublease to franchisees, (iii) sales of ice cream and other products to franchisees in certain international markets, and (iv) other income including fees for the licensing of our brands for products sold in certain retail outlets, the licensing of the right to manufacture Baskin-Robbins ice cream products sold to U.S. franchisees, refranchising gains, transfer fees from franchisees, and online training fees. Prior to completing the sale of all company-operated restaurants in fiscal year 2016, we also generated revenue from retail store sales at our company-operated restaurants.




	Approximately


	66%


	 of our revenue for fiscal year


	2016


	 was derived from royalty income and franchise fees. Rental income from franchisees that lease or sublease their properties from us accounted for


	12%


	 of our revenue for fiscal year


	2016


	. An additional


	14%


	 of our revenue for fiscal year


	2016


	 was generated from sales of ice cream and other products to franchisees in certain international markets. The balance of our revenue for fiscal year


	2016


	 consisted of revenue from our company-operated restaurants, license fees on products sold in non-franchised outlets, license fees on sales of ice cream and other products to Baskin-Robbins franchisees in the U.S., refranchising gains, transfer fees from franchisees, and online training fees.




	Franchisees fund the vast majority of the cost of new restaurant development. As a result, we are able to grow our system with lower capital requirements than many of our competitors. With no company-operated points of distribution as of


	December 31, 2016


	, we are less affected by store-level costs, profitability, and fluctuations in commodity costs than other QSR operators.




	Our franchisees fund substantially all of the advertising that supports both brands. Those advertising funds also fund the cost of our marketing, research and development, and innovation personnel. Royalty payments and advertising fund contributions typically are made on a weekly basis for restaurants in the U.S., which limit our working capital needs. For fiscal year


	2016


	, franchisee contributions to the U.S. advertising funds were


	$430.3


	 million.




	We operate and report financial information on a 52- or 53-week year on a 13-week quarter basis with the fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December and fiscal quarters ending on the 13th Saturday of each quarter (or 14th Saturday when applicable with respect to the fourth fiscal quarter). The data periods contained within fiscal years


	2016


	,


	2015


	, and


	2014


	 reflect the results of operations for the 53-week, 52 week, and 52-week periods ending on


	December 31, 2016


	,


	December 26, 2015


	, and


	December 27, 2014


	, respectively. Certain financial measures and other metrics have been presented with the impact of the additional week on the results for fiscal year 2016. The impact of the additional week in fiscal year 2016 reflects our estimate of the 53rd week on systemwide sales growth, revenues, and expenses.

	Adjusted operating income and adjusted net income are non-GAAP measures reflecting operating income and net income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, long-lived asset impairments, impairments of investments in joint ventures, and other non-recurring, infrequent, or unusual charges, net of the tax impact of such adjustments in the case of adjusted net income. The Company uses adjusted operating income and adjusted net income as key performance measures for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. We also believe adjusted operating income and adjusted net income provide our investors with useful information regarding our historical operating results. These non-GAAP measurements are not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Use of the terms adjusted operating income and adjusted net income may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. See note 4 to “Selected Financial Data” for reconciliations of operating income and net income determined under GAAP to adjusted operating income and adjusted net income, respectively.




	Systemwide sales and points of distribution information related to restaurants located in Puerto Rico were previously included in the Dunkin' Donuts International and Baskin-Robbins International segments, but are now included in the Dunkin' Donuts Donuts U.S. and Baskin-Robbins U.S. segments based on functional responsibility. Prior year amounts below have been revised to reflect these changes for all years presented.




	Fiscal year


	2016


	 compared to fiscal year


	2015




	Overall growth in systemwide sales of


	6.6%


	 for fiscal year


	2016


	, or 5.2% on a 52-week basis, resulted from the following:













	•






	Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. systemwide sales growth of


	7.9%


	, which was the result of


	397


	 net new restaurants opened in fiscal year


	2016


	 and comparable store sales growth of


	1.6%


	. The increase in comparable store sales was driven by an increase in average ticket, which was favorably impacted by price and unfavorably impacted by units per transaction, offset by a decline in traffic. The growth in sales was driven by beverages, led by iced coffee, including Cold Brew, and hot and iced espresso-based beverages, as well as breakfast sandwiches, led by limited-time-offer products. Approximately 190 basis points of the increase in systemwide sales was attributable to the extra week in fiscal year 2016.
















	•






	Dunkin’ Donuts International systemwide sales growth of


	4.2%


	 as a result of sales increases in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and South America, offset by a decline in sales in South Korea. Systemwide sales in all of these regions were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, systemwide sales for fiscal year 2016 increased by approximately 7%. Dunkin’ Donuts International comparable store sales decreased


	1.9%


	 due primarily to declines in South Korea and Europe, offset by growth in South America.
















	•






	Baskin-Robbins U.S. systemwide sales growth of


	1.5%


	 resulting primarily from comparable store sales growth of


	0.7%


	. Comparable store sales growth was driven by an increase in average ticket offset by a decline in traffic. Sales growth was driven primarily by increased sales of cups and cones, which was a result of increased scoop sales and the new Warm Cookie Sandwich platform. Approximately 130 basis points of the increase in systemwide sales was attributable to the extra week in fiscal year 2016.
















	•






	Baskin-Robbins International systemwide sales growth of


	2.7%


	, driven by a sales increase in Japan, offset by sales declines in South Korea and the Middle East. Sales in Japan were positively impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates, while sales in all other regions were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, most notably
















	-


	 33


	-

















	South Korea. On a constant currency basis, systemwide sales for fiscal year 2016 increased by approximately 1%. Baskin-Robbins International comparable store sales declined


	4.2%


	 driven primarily by declines in South Korea and the Middle East, offset by growth in Japan.




	Changes in systemwide sales are impacted, in part, by changes in the number of points of distribution. Points of distribution and net openings as of and for the fiscal years ended


	December 31, 2016


	 and

	The increase in total revenues of


	$18.0 million


	, or


	2.2%


	, for fiscal year


	2016


	 resulted primarily from a


	$36.3 million


	 increase in franchise fees and royalty income driven by the increase in Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. systemwide sales and the extra week in fiscal year 2016. These increases in revenues were offset by a decrease in sales at company-operated restaurants of


	$16.4 million


	 driven by a net decrease in the number of company-operated restaurants, as well as a decrease in other revenues of


	$2.2 million


	, due primarily to revenue recorded in the prior fiscal year in connection with a settlement reached with a master licensee. Approximately $8.8 million of the increase in total revenues was attributable to the extra week in fiscal year 2016, consisting primarily of additional royalty income.




	Operating income increased


	$95.1 million


	, or


	29.8%


	, for fiscal year


	2016


	 due primarily to an impairment of our investment in the Japan joint venture (“Japan JV”) in the prior fiscal year, the increase in franchise fees and royalty income, and gains recognized in connection with the sale of company-operated restaurants. These increases in operating income were offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. Approximately $6.1 million of the increase in operating income was attributable to the extra week in fiscal year 2016, consisting primarily of additional royalty income, offset by additional personnel costs.




	Adjusted operating income increased


	$36.1 million


	, or


	9.0%


	, for fiscal year


	2016


	 driven by the increases in franchise fees and royalty income, as well as the gains recognized in connection with the sale of company-operated restaurants. These increases in revenues were offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. Approximately $6.1 million of the increase in adjusted operating income was attributable to the extra week in fiscal year 2016, consisting primarily of additional royalty income, offset by additional personnel costs.




	Net income attributable to Dunkin’ Brands increased


	$90.3 million


	, or


	85.9%


	, for fiscal year


	2016


	 as a result of the


	$95.1 million


	 increase in operating income and a


	$20.6 million


	 loss on debt extinguishment and refinancing transactions recorded in the prior fiscal year, offset by increases in income tax expense of


	$21.3 million


	 and net interest expense of


	$3.9 million


	 driven by additional borrowings incurred in conjunction with the securitization refinancing transaction completed during January 2015. Also contributing to the increase in net interest expense was the extra week in fiscal year 2016.




	Adjusted net income increased


	$20.8 million


	, or


	11.1%


	, for fiscal year


	2016


	 resulting primarily from the


	$36.1 million


	 increase in adjusted operating income, offset by increases in income tax expense and net interest expense.

	Fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014




	Overall growth in systemwide sales of 4.1% for fiscal year 2015, resulted from the following:













	•






	Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. systemwide sales growth of 6.2%, which was the result of 349 net new restaurants opened in fiscal year 2015 and comparable store sales growth of 1.4%. The increase in comparable store sales was driven by an increase in average ticket, which was favorably impacted by pricing and unfavorably impacted by product mix, offset by a decline in traffic. The growth in average ticket was led by sales of beverages, including iced coffee and espresso, and donuts. In-restaurant K-Cup® sales had a negative impact on comparable store sales.
















	•






	Dunkin’ Donuts International systemwide sales decline of 2.8% as a result of sales decreases in South Korea and Colombia, offset by sales increases in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Sales in South Korea, Europe, South America, and Asia were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, systemwide sales for fiscal year 2015 increased by approximately 6%. Dunkin’ Donuts International comparable store sales increased 0.5% driven primarily by increases in Asia, South America, and the Middle East, offset by declines in Europe and South Korea.
















	•






	Baskin-Robbins U.S. systemwide sales growth of 6.1% resulting primarily from comparable store sales growth of 6.1%. Baskin-Robbins U.S. comparable store sales growth was driven by increased sales of cups and cones, beverages, desserts, and sundaes, as well as increased sales of cakes stimulated by strong year-over-year growth of online cake ordering. Comparable store sales growth was driven by increases in both traffic and ticket.
















	•






	Baskin-Robbins International systemwide sales decline of 4.6%, driven by sales declines in Japan, South Korea, and Europe, offset by sales growth in the Middle East and Asia. Sales in all regions were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rates, most notably Japan and South Korea. On a constant currency basis, systemwide sales for fiscal year 2015 increased by approximately 5%. Baskin-Robbins International comparable store sales declined 1.9% driven primarily by declines in Japan and South Korea, offset by growth in the Middle East.

	The increase in total revenues of $62.2 million, or 8.3%, for fiscal year 2015 resulted primarily from a $30.9 million increase in franchise fees and royalty income driven by the increase in Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. systemwide sales and additional franchise fees due to favorable development mix and additional gross development, and an increase in other revenues of $24.7 million, due primarily to licensing fees earned from the Dunkin’ K-Cup® pod licensing agreement. Also contributing to the increase in revenues for fiscal year 2015 was an increase in sales at company-operated restaurants of $6.1 million, driven by a net increase in the number of company-operated restaurants.




	Operating income decreased $19.3 million, or 5.7%, for fiscal year 2015 driven by a $54.3 million impairment of our investment in the Japan JV, an increase in general and administrative expenses driven primarily by incremental incentive compensation accruals, an increase in share-based compensation, and costs incurred related to the final settlement of our

	Canadian pension plan as a result of the closure of our Canadian ice cream manufacturing plant in fiscal year 2012. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was a decrease in other operating income due to the timing of the sale of real estate and a gain recognized in the prior year in connection with the sale of company-operated restaurants in the Atlanta market. These items were offset by the increase in franchise fees and royalty income, licensing fees earned from the sale of Dunkin’ K-Cup® pods, and an increase in ice cream margin.




	Adjusted operating income increased $34.5 million, or 9.4%, for fiscal year 2015 driven by the increases in franchise fees and royalty income, licensing fees earned from the Dunkin’ K-Cup® pod licensing agreement, and ice cream margin. The increases in revenues and ice cream margin were offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses, net, driven primarily by incremental incentive compensation accruals and share-based compensation, and a decrease in other operating income due to the timing of the sale of real estate and a gain recognized in the prior year in connection with the sale of company-operated restaurants in the Atlanta market.




	Net income attributable to Dunkin’ Brands decreased $71.1 million, or 40.3%, for fiscal year 2015 as a result of the $19.3 million decrease in operating income, a $28.5 million increase in net interest expense driven by additional borrowings incurred in conjunction with the securitization refinancing transaction completed during January 2015, a $16.2 million increase in income tax expense as the prior year was favorably impacted by tax benefits resulting from a restructuring of our Canadian subsidiaries, and a $6.8 million increase in loss on debt extinguishment and refinancing transactions.









	Adjusted net income increased $1.8 million, or 1.0%, for fiscal year 2015 resulting primarily from a $34.5 million increase in adjusted operating income, offset by increases in net interest expense and income tax expense.

	Diluted adjusted earnings per share is calculated using adjusted net income, as defined above, and diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted adjusted earnings per share is not a presentation made in accordance with GAAP, and our use of the term diluted adjusted earnings per share may vary from similar measures reported by others in our industry due to the potential differences in the method of calculation. Diluted adjusted earnings per share should not be considered as an alternative to earnings per share derived in accordance with GAAP. Diluted adjusted earnings per share has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because of these limitations, we rely primarily on our GAAP results. However, we believe that presenting diluted adjusted earnings per share is appropriate to provide investors with useful information regarding our historical operating results.

The impact of the impairment of our investment in the Japan JV was approximately 10% on the overall effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015.




	Operating segments




	We operate four reportable operating segments: Dunkin’ Donuts U.S., Dunkin’ Donuts International, Baskin-Robbins U.S., and Baskin-Robbins International. We evaluate the performance of our segments and allocate resources to them based on operating income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, long-lived asset impairment charges, and other infrequent or unusual charges, which does not reflect the allocation of any corporate charges. This profitability measure is referred to as segment profit. Segment profit for the Dunkin’ Donuts International and Baskin-Robbins International segments includes net income of equity method investments, except for other-than-temporary impairment charges and the related reduction in depreciation, net of tax, on the underlying long-lived assets.

	-

















	Beginning in fiscal year 2016, certain segment profit amounts in the tables below have been reclassified as a result of the realignment of our organizational structure to better support our segment operations, including the allocation of previously unallocated costs. Additionally, revenues and segment profit related to restaurants located in Puerto Rico were previously included in the Dunkin' Donuts International and Baskin-Robbins International segments, but are now included in the Dunkin' Donuts Donuts U.S. and Baskin-Robbins U.S. segments based on functional responsibility. Prior year amounts in the tables below have been revised to reflect these changes for all years presented.




	For reconciliations to total revenues and income before income taxes, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Revenues for all segments include only transactions with unaffiliated customers and include no intersegment revenues. Revenues not included in segment revenues include revenue earned through certain licensing arrangements with third parties in which our brand names are used, revenue generated from online training programs for franchisees, and revenues from the sale of Dunkin’ Donuts products in certain international markets, all of which are not allocated to a specific segment.

	The increase in Baskin-Robbins U.S. revenues for fiscal year


	2016


	 was due primarily to increases in other revenues of


	$1.0 million


	 driven by an increase in licensing income, royalty income of


	$0.6 million


	 due primarily to the extra week in fiscal year 2016 and an increase in systemwide sales, and franchise fees of


	$0.2 million


	 due to an increase in renewal income. Offsetting these increases in revenues was a decrease in sales of ice cream and other products of


	$1.4 million


	. A portion of the fluctuations in licensing income and sales of ice cream and other products can be attributed to a shift in certain franchisees who previously purchased ice cream from the Company now purchasing ice cream directly from our third-party ice cream manufacturer through which we earn a licensing fee. Approximately $0.5 million of the increase in total revenues was attributable to the extra week in fiscal year 2016, consisting primarily of additional royalty income.




	Baskin-Robbins U.S. segment profit for fiscal year


	2016


	 increased primarily as a result of a decrease in general and administrative expenses due primarily to decreases in expenses incurred related to brand-building activities and incentive compensation. Also contributing to the increase in segment profit were the increases in other revenues, royalty income, and franchise fees.

The increase in other revenues was driven by licensing fees earned from the Dunkin’ K-Cup® pod licensing agreement and increased licensing fees earned from ice cream sales by our third-party ice cream manufacturer, as well as a settlement reached with a master licensee, which resulted in the recovery of prior period royalty income and franchise fees. Also contributing to the increase in revenues was an increase in sales at company-operated restaurants of $6.1 million driven by a net increase in the number of company-operated restaurants. An increase in rental income of $2.8 million, driven by increases in average rent per lease, sales-based rental income, and the number of leases was offset by a decline in sales of ice cream and other products of $2.2 million.

	Occupancy expenses for franchised restaurants for fiscal year 2015 increased $1.2 million, or 2.3%, from the prior fiscal year driven primarily by an increase in average rent per lease and an increase in sales-based rental expense.




	Net margin on ice cream products increased for fiscal year 2015 to $38.4 million as a decrease in commodity costs, increase in pricing, and favorable foreign exchange rates more than offset the decrease in sales volume.




	Company-operated restaurant expenses increased $7.2 million, or 31.8%, from the prior year primarily as a result of a net increase in the number of company-operated restaurants operating during the year.




	General and administrative expenses increased $17.5 million, or 7.7%, in fiscal year 2015 due primarily to an increase in personnel costs driven by incremental incentive compensation accruals and an increase in share-based compensation. Also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses were costs incurred related to the final settlement of our Canadian pension plan as a result of the closure of our Canadian ice cream manufacturing plant in fiscal year 2012, as well as an increase in costs incurred to support our consumer packaged goods and international businesses.




	Depreciation and amortization decreased $0.3 million in fiscal year 2015 resulting primarily from a decrease in amortization due to intangible assets becoming fully amortized and favorable lease intangible assets being written-off upon termination of the related leases, offset by an increase in depreciation due to the addition of depreciable assets.













	-


	 41


	-

















	The decrease in long-lived asset impairment charges in fiscal year 2015 of $0.9 million was driven primarily by the timing of lease terminations, which resulted in the write-off of favorable lease intangible assets and leasehold improvements.




	Net income (loss) of equity method investments decreased $56.6 million in fiscal year 2015 driven by an impairment of our investment in the Japan JV of $54.3 million. The Japan JV impairment resulted from an other-than-temporary decline in the value of our investment as a result of various factors including the continued declines in the operating performance of the joint venture and reduced future expectations of the Baskin-Robbins business in Japan, as well as an announced reconsideration of the amount of semi-annual dividend payments by the Japan JV in the fourth quarter (see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion). Also contributing to the decrease were unfavorable results from our Japan JV compared to the prior fiscal year and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates on net income of our South Korea joint venture.




	Other operating income, net includes gains recognized in connection with the sale of real estate and fluctuates based on the timing of such transactions. Additionally, other operating income, net of $7.8 million for fiscal year 2014 included a gain recognized in connection with the sale of the company-operated restaurants in the Atlanta market.

	The increase in net interest expense for fiscal year 2015 of $28.5 million was driven primarily by the securitization refinancing transaction that occurred in January 2015, which resulted in additional borrowings and an increase in the weighted average interest rate, as well as an increase in amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs compared to the prior fiscal year.




	The loss on debt extinguishment and refinancing transactions for fiscal year 2015 of $20.6 million resulted from the January 2015 securitization refinancing transaction. The loss on debt extinguishment and refinancing transactions for fiscal year 2014 of $13.7 million resulted from the February 2014 refinancing transaction.




	The decrease in other losses, net, for fiscal year 2015 was driven primarily by foreign exchange losses due primarily to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the Australian dollar and the pound sterling.

	The increased effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 resulted primarily from the impairment of our investment in the Japan JV, which reduced income before income taxes but for which there is no corresponding tax benefit. The impact of the impairment of our investment in the Japan JV was approximately 10% on the overall effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015.




	The effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 was lower than normal primarily as a result of the net reversal of approximately $7.0 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions for which settlement with taxing authorities was reached during the year or were otherwise deemed effectively settled. Additionally, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2014 reflects a net tax benefit of $8.5 million related to the restructuring of our Canadian subsidiaries, which included a legal entity conversion of Dunkin’ Brands Canada, Ltd. to a British Columbia unlimited liability company.

Also contributing to revenue growth were increases in franchise fees of $5.1 million due to favorable development mix and additional gross development, rental income of $3.1 million driven primarily by increases in average rent per lease, sales-based rental income, and the number of leases, as well as an increase in other revenues of $2.1 million.




	The increase in Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. segment profit for fiscal year 2015 was driven primarily by the increases in royalty income, franchise fees, and other revenues, as well as a reduction in bad debt expense. These increases in segment profit were offset by gains recognized in the prior fiscal year in connection with the sale of the company-operated restaurants in Atlanta and other real estate, as well as increases in personnel and travel costs in the current year.

	The increase in Dunkin’ Donuts International revenues for fiscal year 2015 resulted primarily from an increase in other revenues of $2.3 million due primarily to a settlement reached with a master licensee resulting in the recovery of prior period royalty income and franchise fees, as well as increases in franchise fees of $0.6 million driven by development in new markets and royalty income of $0.4 million.




	The increase in Dunkin’ Donuts International segment profit for fiscal year 2015 was driven primarily by revenue growth, offset by increases in general and administrative expenses, driven by increased personnel costs, investments in international markets, and bad debt, as well as a decrease in net income from our South Korea joint venture.

	The increase in Baskin-Robbins U.S. revenues for fiscal year 2015 was due primarily to an increase in other revenues of $3.0 million, driven by an increase in licensing income, and an increase in royalty income of $1.3 million due to an increase in systemwide sales, offset by a decrease in sales of ice cream and other products of $2.7 million. The fluctuations in licensing income and sales of ice cream and other products can be attributed to a shift in certain franchisees now purchasing ice cream directly from our third-party ice cream manufacturer.




	Baskin-Robbins U.S. segment profit for fiscal year 2015 increased primarily as a result of the increases in other revenues and royalty income, offset by increases in general and administrative expenses due primarily to expenses incurred related to brand-building activities and increased personnel costs.

	The decrease in Baskin-Robbins International revenues for fiscal year 2015 was due to decreases of $1.6 million in royalty income, which was driven by a decrease in royalty income earned on ice cream sales in Russia and the negative impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, $0.6 million of franchise fees, and $0.4 million of sales of ice cream and other products due primarily to a decline in sales to Australia.




	Baskin-Robbins International segment profit decreased $2.8 million for fiscal year 2015 due primarily to the decreases in royalty income and franchise fees, and an increase in general and administrative expenses driven primarily by an increase in bad debt expense. Also contributing to the decrease in segment profit were unfavorable results from our Japan JV compared to the prior fiscal year and the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates on net income of our South Korea joint venture. These decreases in segment profit were offset by an increase in net margin on ice cream. A decrease in commodity costs, increase in pricing, and favorable foreign exchange rates more than offset the decrease in sales volume, resulting in an increase in net ice cream margin.








	Liquidity and capital resources




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we held


	$361.4 million


	 of cash and cash equivalents and


	$69.7 million


	 of short-term restricted cash that was restricted under our securitized financing facility. Included in cash and cash equivalents is $177.9 million of cash held for advertising funds and reserved for gift card/certificate programs. Cash reserved for gift card/certificate programs also includes cash that will be used to fund initiatives from the gift card breakage liabilities (see note 10 to the consolidated

	financial statements included herein). In addition, as of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had a borrowing capacity of


	$74.1 million


	 under our $100.0 million Variable Funding Notes (as defined below).




	Operating, investing, and financing cash flows




	Net cash provided by operating activities was


	$276.2 million


	 during fiscal year


	2016


	, as compared to


	$185.6 million


	 in fiscal year


	2015


	. The


	$90.6 million


	 increase in operating cash flows was driven primarily by an increase in pre-tax income excluding non-cash items, the fluctuation of restricted cash of


	$67.8 million


	 driven by the initial funding of restricted cash accounts in accordance with the requirements of our securitized debt structure in the prior fiscal year, favorable cash flows related to our gift card program due primarily to the timing of holidays and our fiscal year end, as well as the timing of receipts and payments related to the sale of Dunkin’ K-Cup® pods and the related franchisee profit-sharing program. Offsetting these increases in operating cash flows were payments made in connection with the settlement of the Bertico litigation and increases in incentive compensation payments and cash paid for income taxes.




	Net cash provided by investing activities was


	$1.3 million


	 during fiscal year


	2016


	, as compared to net cash used in investing activities of


	$35.5 million


	 in fiscal year


	2015


	. The


	$36.8 million


	 increase in investing cash flows was driven primarily by a reduction of capital expenditures of


	$15.1 million


	, an increase in proceeds received from the sale of real estate and company-operated restaurants of


	$17.8 million


	, as well as cash paid for the acquisition of a company-operated restaurant in the prior fiscal year period.




	Net cash used in financing activities was


	$176.3 million


	 during fiscal year


	2016


	, as compared to


	$96.9 million


	 in fiscal year


	2015


	. The


	$79.5 million


	 increase in net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by the favorable impact of debt-related activities of


	$614.1 million


	 in the prior fiscal year, resulting from proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of debt repayment, payment of debt issuance and other debt-related costs, and funding of restricted cash accounts, as well as the repayment of debt in the current fiscal year of


	$25.0 million


	. Also contributing to the increase in net cash used in financing activities were additional dividends paid on common stock of


	$9.2 million


	 in fiscal year


	2016


	 compared to fiscal year


	2015


	, as well as a reduction of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation of


	$8.8 million


	. Offsetting the unfavorable impact of debt-related activities was incremental cash used in the prior fiscal year for repurchases of common stock of


	$570.0 million


	.




	Free cash flow




	During fiscal year


	2016


	, net cash provided by operating activities was


	$276.2 million


	, as compared to


	$185.6 million


	 for fiscal year


	2015


	. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal years


	2016


	 and


	2015


	 includes net cash inflows of


	$29.4 million


	 and


	$12.3 million


	, respectively, related to advertising funds and gift card/certificate programs. Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year


	2015


	 includes the net funding of restricted cash accounts of $65.7 million, which represents cash restricted in accordance with our securitized financing facility and will be used for operating activities such as to pay interest and real estate obligations, while net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year


	2016


	 includes the net release of restricted cash of


	$2.1 million


	. Excluding cash held for advertising funds and reserved for gift card/certificate programs and excluding the fluctuation in restricted cash, we generated


	$246.1 million


	 and


	$203.4 million


	 of free cash flow during fiscal years


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively.




	The increase in free cash flow from fiscal year


	2015


	 to


	2016


	 was due primarily to an increase in pre-tax income, excluding non-cash items, the timing of receipts and payments related to the sale of Dunkin’ K-Cup® pods and the related franchisee profit-sharing program, an increase in proceeds from the sale of real estate and company-operated restaurants, and a reduction in capital expenditures compared to the prior fiscal year. Offsetting these increases in free cash flow were payments made in connection with the settlement of the Bertico litigation and increases in incentive compensation payments and cash paid for income taxes.




	Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure reflecting net cash provided by operating and investing activities, excluding the cash flows related to advertising funds, gift card/certificate programs, and restricted cash. We use free cash flow as a key performance measure for the purpose of evaluating performance internally and our ability to generate cash. We also believe free cash flow provides our investors with useful information regarding our historical cash flow results. This non-GAAP measurement is not intended to replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with GAAP. Use of the term free cash flow may differ from similar measures reported by other companies.

	Borrowing capacity




	Our securitized financing facility included original aggregate borrowings of approximately $2.60 billion, consisting of $2.50 billion Class A-2 Notes (as defined below) and $100.0 million of Variable Funding Notes (as defined below) which were undrawn at closing. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there was approximately


	$2.46 billion


	 of total principal outstanding on the Class A-2 Notes, while there was


	$74.1 million


	 in available commitments under the Variable Funding Notes as


	$25.9 million


	 of letters of credit were outstanding.




	On January 26, 2015, DB Master Finance LLC (the “Master Issuer”), a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (“DBGI”), entered into a base indenture and a related supplemental indenture (collectively, the “Indenture”) under which the Master Issuer may issue multiple series of notes. On the same date, the Master Issuer issued Series 2015-1 3.262% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Class A-2-I Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $750.0 million and Series 2015-1 3.980% Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “Class A-2-II Notes” and, together with the Class A-2-I Notes, the “Class A-2 Notes”) with an initial principal amount of $1.75 billion. In addition, the Master Issuer also issued Series 2015-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 (the “Variable Funding Notes” and, together with the Class A-2 Notes, the “Notes”), which allow the Master Issuer to borrow up to $100.0 million on a revolving basis. The Variable Funding Notes may also be used to issue letters of credit. The Notes were issued in a securitization transaction pursuant to which most of the Company’s domestic and certain of its foreign revenue-generating assets, consisting principally of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, and intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property, are held by the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors of the Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets to secure the Notes.




	The legal final maturity date of the Class A-2 Notes is in February 2045, but it is anticipated that, unless earlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the Class A-2-I Notes will be repaid in February 2019 and the Class A-2-II Notes will be repaid in February 2022 (the “Anticipated Repayment Dates”). Principal amortization repayments, payable quarterly, are required on the Class A-2-I Notes and Class A-2-II Notes equal to $7.5 million and $17.5 million, respectively, per calendar year through the respective Anticipated Repayment Dates. No principal payments will be required if a specified leverage ratio, which is a measure of outstanding debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain items (as specified in the Indenture), is less than or equal to


	5.0


	 to 1.0, though the Company intends to continue to make the scheduled principal payments. If the Class A-2 Notes have not been repaid in full by their respective Anticipated Repayment Dates, a rapid amortization event will occur in which residual net cash flows of the Master Issuer, after making certain required payments, will be applied to the outstanding principal of the Class A-2 Notes. Various other events, including failure to maintain a minimum ratio of net cash flows to debt service, may also cause a rapid amortization event.




	It is anticipated that the principal and interest on the Variable Funding Notes will be repaid in full on or prior to February 2020, subject to two additional one-year extensions.




	In order to assess our current debt levels, including servicing our long-term debt, and our ability to take on additional borrowings, we monitor a leverage ratio of our long-term debt, net of cash (“Net Debt”), to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). This leverage ratio, and the related Net Debt and Adjusted EBITDA measures used to compute it are non-GAAP measures, and our use of the terms Net Debt and Adjusted EBITDA may vary from other companies, including those in our industry, due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. Net Debt reflects the gross principal amount outstanding under our securitized financing facility and capital lease obligations, less short-term cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, excluding cash reserved for gift card/certificate programs. Adjusted EBITDA is defined in our securitized financing facility as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and impairment charges, as adjusted for certain items that are summarized in the table below. Net Debt should not be considered as an alternative to debt, total liabilities, or any other obligations derived in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of operating performance, or as an alternative













	-


	 46


	-

















	to cash flows as a measure of liquidity. Net Debt, Adjusted EBITDA, and the related leverage ratio have important limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. However, we believe that presenting Net Debt, Adjusted EBITDA and the related leverage ratio are appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate our current debt levels and ability to take on additional borrowings.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we had a Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.6 to 1.0. The following is a reconciliation of our Net Debt and Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding GAAP measures as of and for the fiscal year ending

	Based upon our current level of operations and anticipated growth, we believe that the cash generated from our operations and amounts available under our Variable Funding Notes will be adequate to meet our anticipated debt service requirements, capital expenditures, and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months. We believe that we will be able to meet these obligations even if we experience no growth in sales or profits. There can be no assurance, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our Variable Funding Notes or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, including our securitized financing facility, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our future operating performance and our ability to service, extend, or refinance the securitized financing facility will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.








	Off balance sheet obligations




	In limited instances, we issue guarantees to financial institutions so that our franchisees can obtain financing for various business purposes. We monitor the financial condition of our franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on guaranteed liabilities of our franchisees if we believe that our franchisees are unable to make their required payments. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, if all of our outstanding guarantees of third-party franchisee financing obligations came due simultaneously, we would be liable for approximately


	$1.5 million


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there were no amounts under such guarantees that were due. We generally have cross-default provisions with these franchisees that would put the franchisee in default of its franchise agreement in the event of non-payment under such loans. We believe these cross-default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we would not be able to recover the amount of required payments under these guarantees and, historically, we have not incurred significant losses under these guarantees due to defaults by our franchisees.













	-


	 47


	-

















	We have various supply chain contracts that provide for purchase commitments or exclusivity, the majority of which result in us being contingently liable upon early termination of the agreement or engaging with another supplier. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we were contingently liable under such supply chain agreements for approximately


	$136.2 million


	. We assess the risk of performing under each of these guarantees on a quarterly basis, and, based on various factors including internal forecasts, prior history, and ability to extend contract terms, we have determined no material reserves are necessary related to these commitments as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	As a result of assigning our interest in obligations under property leases as a condition of the refranchising of certain restaurants and the guarantee of certain other leases, we are contingently liable on certain lease agreements. These leases have varying terms, the latest of which expires in


	2024


	. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the potential amount of undiscounted payments we could be required to make in the event of nonpayment by the primary lessee was


	$4.0 million


	. Our franchisees are the primary lessees under the majority of these leases. We generally have cross-default provisions with these franchisees that would put them in default of their franchise agreement in the event of nonpayment under the lease. We believe these cross-default provisions significantly reduce the risk that we will be required to make payments under these leases, and we have not recorded a liability for such contingent liabilities.

	Amounts include obligations to former employees under severance agreements. Excluded from these amounts are any payments that may be required related to pending litigation, as more fully described in note 17(d) to our consolidated financial statements included herein, as the amount and timing of cash requirements, if any, are uncertain. Additionally, liabilities to employees and former employees under deferred compensation arrangements totaling $11.1 million are excluded from the table above, as timing of payment is uncertain.
















	(3)






	We have various supply chain contracts that provide for purchase commitments or exclusivity, the majority of which result in our being contingently liable upon early termination of the agreement or engaging with another supplier. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, we were contingently liable under such supply chain agreements for approximately


	$136.2 million

	$4.0 million


	 under these guarantees, which are discussed further above in “Off balance sheet obligations.” Additionally, in certain cases, we issue guarantees to financial institutions so that franchisees can obtain financing. If all outstanding guarantees came due as of

	Critical accounting policies




	Our significant accounting policies are more fully described under the heading “Summary of significant accounting policies” in Note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. However, we believe the accounting policies described below are particularly important to the portrayal and understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require application of significant judgment by our management. In applying these policies, management uses its judgment in making certain assumptions and estimates.




	These judgments involve estimations of the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may have a significant impact on our quarterly and annual results of operations or financial condition. Changes in estimates and judgments could significantly affect our result of operations, financial condition, and cash flow in future years. The following is a description of what we consider to be our most significant critical accounting policies.




	Revenue recognition




	Initial franchise fee revenue is recognized upon substantial completion of the services required of us as stated in the franchise agreement, which is generally upon opening of the respective restaurant. Fees collected in advance are deferred until earned. Royalty income is based on a percentage of franchisee gross sales and is recognized when earned, which occurs at the franchisees’ point of sale. Renewal fees are recognized when a renewal agreement with a franchisee becomes effective. Rental income for base rentals is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rent is recognized as earned, and any amounts received from lessees in advance of achieving stipulated thresholds are deferred until such threshold is actually achieved. Revenue from the sale of ice cream is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the buyer, which is generally upon delivery. Licensing fees are recognized when earned, which is generally upon sale of the underlying products by the licensees. Retail store revenues at company-operated restaurants are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale, net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. Gains on the refranchise or sale of a restaurant are recognized when the sale transaction closes, the franchisee has a minimum amount of the purchase price in at risk equity, and we are satisfied that the buyer can meet its financial obligations to us.




	Our revenue recognition policies will be impacted by new guidance for revenue recognition beginning in fiscal year 2018. See “Recently Issued Accounting Standards” below for further discussion.




	Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets




	Goodwill and trade names (“indefinite-lived intangibles”) have been assigned to our reporting units, which are also our operating segments, for purposes of impairment testing. All of our reporting units have indefinite-lived intangibles associated with them.




	We evaluate the remaining useful life of our trade names to determine whether current events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. In addition, all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a trade name is impaired. In the event we were to determine that the carrying value of a trade name would more likely than not exceed its fair value, quantitative testing would be performed. Quantitative testing consists of a comparison of the fair value of each trade name with its carrying value, with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recognized as an impairment loss. For goodwill, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. In the event we were to determine that a reporting unit’s carrying value would more likely than not exceed its fair value, quantitative testing would be performed which consists of a comparison of each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. The fair value of a reporting unit is an estimate of the amount for which the unit as a whole could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. We have selected the first day of our fiscal third quarter as the date on which to perform our annual impairment test for all indefinite-lived intangible assets. We also test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of such indefinite-lived intangibles has been impaired. We determined the fair values of all reporting units with goodwill balances were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values as of the most recent goodwill testing date. No impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets was recorded during fiscal years


	2016


	,


	2015


	, or


	2014


	.




	We have intangible assets other than goodwill and trade names that are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives or terms of their related agreements. Other intangible assets consist primarily of franchise and international license rights (“franchise rights”), ice cream distribution and territorial franchise agreement license rights (“license rights”), and operating lease interests acquired related to our prime leases and subleases (“operating leases acquired”). Franchise rights, license rights, and operating leases acquired recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were valued using an appropriate valuation method during the period of acquisition. Amortization of franchise rights, license rights, and favorable operating leases acquired is recorded as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations and amortized over the













	-


	 49


	-

















	respective franchise, license, and lease terms using the straight-line method. Unfavorable operating leases acquired related to our prime leases and subleases are recorded in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized into rental expense and rental income, respectively, over the base lease term of the respective leases using the straight-line method. Our amortizable intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. An intangible asset that is deemed impaired is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted cash flows.




	Income taxes




	Our major tax jurisdictions subject to income tax are the U.S. and Canada. The majority of our U.S. legal entities are limited liability companies (“LLCs”), which are single member entities that are treated as disregarded entities and included as part of DBGI in a consolidated federal income tax return. We also have subsidiaries in foreign jurisdictions that file separate tax returns in their respective countries and local jurisdictions, as required. Additionally, we have a foreign subsidiary located in Dubai within the United Arab Emirates, for which no income tax return is required to be filed. The current income tax liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries are calculated on a stand-alone basis. The current federal tax liability for each entity included in our consolidated federal income tax return is calculated on a stand-alone basis, including foreign taxes, for which a separate company foreign tax credit is calculated in lieu of a deduction for foreign withholding taxes paid. As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities.




	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future tax consequences of items that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effects of changes in tax rate and changes in apportionment of income between tax jurisdictions on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the year in which the law is enacted or change in apportionment occurs. Valuation allowances are provided when we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of identified tax assets.




	A tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Estimates of interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in the provision for income taxes.




	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.




	Legal contingencies




	We are engaged in litigation that arises in the ordinary course of business as a franchisor. Such matters typically include disputes related to compliance with the terms of franchise and development agreements, including claims or threats of claims of breach of contract, negligence, and other alleged violations by us. We record reserves for legal contingencies when information available to us indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Predicting the outcomes of claims and litigation and estimating the related costs and exposures involve substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. Legal costs incurred in connection with legal and other contingencies are expensed as the costs are incurred.




	Allowances for franchise, license, and lease receivables




	We reserve all or a portion of a franchisee’s receivable balance when deemed necessary based upon detailed review of such balances, and apply a pre-defined reserve percentage based on an aging criteria to other balances. We perform our reserve analysis during each fiscal quarter or when events or circumstances indicate that we may not collect the balance due. While we use the best information available in making our determination, the ultimate recovery of recorded receivables is also dependent upon future economic events and other conditions that may be beyond our control.




	Impairment of equity method investments




	We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that may have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of the investment. If a loss in value has occurred and is deemed to be other













	-


	 50


	-

















	than temporary, an impairment loss is recorded. We review several factors to determine whether a loss has occurred that is other than temporary, including absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the length and extent of the fair value decline, and the financial condition and future prospects of the investee.








	Recently Issued Accounting Standards




	In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued new guidance for goodwill impairment which requires only a single-step quantitative test to identify and measure impairment and record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. The option to perform a qualitative assessment first for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary does not change under the new guidance. This guidance is effective for us beginning in fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt this guidance in fiscal year 2017. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements.




	In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance addressing diversity in practice that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash in the statements of cash flows. This guidance is effective for us beginning in fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt this guidance retrospectively beginning in fiscal year 2017. Upon adoption, restricted cash will be combined with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and the current presentation of changes in restricted cash within operating and financing activities will be eliminated. Upon adoption of this guidance, net cash provided by operating activities will be reduced by $2.1 million and will increase by $65.7 million for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash used in financing activities will increase by $106 thousand and will be reduced by $6.8 million for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on our consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets.




	In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance for employee share-based compensation which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including excess tax benefits, forfeiture estimates, statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification in the statements of cash flows. This guidance is effective for us in fiscal year 2017 with early adoption permitted. We expect to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year 2017. Upon adoption, any future excess tax benefits or deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations instead of additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, excess tax benefits will be presented retrospectively as an operating cash inflow instead of a financing cash inflow in the statements of cash flows. During fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, $2.7 million, $11.5 million, and $10.8 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits were recorded to additional paid-in capital that would have been recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, and such amounts would have been classified as operating cash inflows instead of financing cash inflows in the consolidated statements of cash flows, if this new guidance had been adopted as of the respective dates.




	In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance for lease accounting, which replaces existing lease accounting guidance. The new guidance aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for us in fiscal year 2019 with early adoption permitted, and modified retrospective application is required. We expect to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year 2019 and are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We expect that substantially all of our operating lease commitments (see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included herein) will be subject to the new guidance and will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption.




	In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance for revenue recognition related to contracts with customers, except for contracts within the scope of other standards, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance provides a single framework in which revenue is required to be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for us in fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted in fiscal year 2017. We expect to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year 2018 using the full retrospective transition method, which will result in restating each prior reporting period presented in the year of adoption. We expect the adoption of the new guidance to change the timing of recognition of initial franchise fees, including master license and territory fees for our international business, and renewal fees. Currently, these fees are generally recognized upfront upon either opening of the respective restaurant or when a renewal agreement becomes effective. The new guidance will generally require these fees to be recognized over the term of the related franchise license for the respective restaurant, which we expect will result in a material impact to revenue recognized for franchise fees and renewal fees. We do not expect this new guidance to materially impact the recognition of royalty income, rental income, or sales of ice cream and other products. We are continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on these and other revenue transactions, as well as the presentation of advertising fund revenues and expenses, in addition to the impact on accounting policies and related disclosures.

	Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk







	Foreign exchange risk




	We are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy. Most of our revenues, costs, and debts are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, royalty income from our international franchisees is payable in U.S. dollars, and is generally based on a percentage of franchisee gross sales denominated in the foreign currency of the country in which the point of distribution is located, and is therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, our investments in, and equity income from, joint ventures are denominated in foreign currencies, and are therefore also subject to foreign currency fluctuations. For fiscal year


	2016


	, a 5% change in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar would have had an approximately $1.2 million impact on international royalty income and an approximately $0.7 million impact on equity in net income of joint ventures. Additionally, a 5% change in foreign currencies as of


	December 31, 2016


	 would have had a $5.7 million impact on the carrying value of our investments in joint ventures. In the future, we may consider the use of derivative financial instruments, such as forward contracts, to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks.

	Financial Statements and Supplementary Data













	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm




	The Board of Directors and Stockholders




	Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc.:









	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended


	December 31, 2016


	. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended


	December 31, 2016


	, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.




	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	, based on criteria established in


	 Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)


	 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated


	February 21, 2017


	 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

	DUNKIN’ BRANDS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES






	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements













	(1) Description of business and organization




	Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (“DBGI”), together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is one of the world’s leading franchisors of restaurants serving coffee and baked goods, as well as ice cream, within the quick service restaurant segment of the restaurant industry. We develop, franchise, and license a system of both traditional and nontraditional quick service restaurants and, in limited circumstances, have owned and operated individual locations. Through our Dunkin’ Donuts brand, we develop and franchise restaurants featuring coffee, donuts, bagels, breakfast sandwiches, and related products. Additionally, we license Dunkin’ Donuts brand products sold in certain retail outlets such as retail packaged coffee and Dunkin’ K-Cup® pods. Through our Baskin-Robbins brand, we develop and franchise restaurants featuring ice cream, frozen beverages, and related products. Additionally, we distribute Baskin-Robbins ice cream products to Baskin-Robbins franchisees and licensees in certain international markets.




	Throughout these consolidated financial statements, “Dunkin’ Brands,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and “management” refer to DBGI and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole.








	(2) Summary of significant accounting policies




	(a) Fiscal year




	The Company operates and reports financial information on a


	52- or 53-week


	 year on a


	13-week


	 quarter basis with the fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December and fiscal quarters ending on the 13th Saturday of each quarter (or 14th Saturday when applicable with respect to the fourth fiscal quarter). The data periods contained within fiscal years 2016,


	2015


	, and


	2014


	 reflect the results of operations for the 53-week period ended


	December 31, 2016


	, and the


	52-week


	 periods ended


	December 26, 2015


	 and


	December 27, 2014


	, respectively.




	(b) Basis of presentation and consolidation




	The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DBGI and subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). All significant transactions and balances between subsidiaries and affiliates have been eliminated in consolidation.




	We consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, the usual condition of which is ownership of a majority voting interest. We also consider for consolidation an entity, in which we have certain interests, where the controlling financial interest may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. Such an entity, known as a variable interest entity (“VIE”), is required to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that possesses the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that are significant to it. The principal entities in which we possess a variable interest include franchise entities, the advertising funds (see note 4), and our equity method investees. We do not possess any ownership interests in franchise entities, except for our investments in various entities that are accounted for under the equity method. Additionally, we generally do not provide financial support to franchise entities in a typical franchise relationship. As our franchise and license arrangements provide our franchisee and licensee entities the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance, we do not consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of any such entity that might be a VIE. Based on the results of our analysis of potential VIEs, we have not consolidated any franchise entities, with the exception of those noted below. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss resulting from involvement with potential franchise VIEs is attributable to aged trade and notes receivable balances, outstanding loan guarantees, and future lease payments due from franchisees (see note 11).




	Noncontrolling interests included within total stockholders’ deficit in the consolidated balance sheet as of


	December 26, 2015


	 represented interests in a franchise entity that was deemed a variable interest entity and for which the Company was the primary beneficiary. As of December 31, 2016, the Company was no longer the primary beneficiary of the franchise entity and deconsolidated the noncontrolling interests from the Company's consolidated financial statements.




	The Company previously held a


	51%


	 interest in a limited partnership that owned and operated Dunkin’ Donuts restaurants in the Dallas, Texas area. The Company possessed control of this entity and, therefore, consolidated the results of the limited partnership. The partnership agreement contained a redemption feature that was probable to become redeemable in the future, and this interest was therefore classified as temporary equity (between liabilities and stockholders’ deficit) in the consolidated balance sheets. The net loss and comprehensive loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest are presented separately in the













	-


	 59


	-

















	consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, respectively. During fiscal year 2015, the Company purchased the remaining interests in the limited partnership.




	(c) Accounting estimates




	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and for the period then ended. Significant estimates are made in the calculations and assessments of the following: (a) allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivables, (b) impairment of tangible and intangible assets, (c) other-than-temporary impairment of equity method investments, (d) income taxes, (e) share-based compensation, (f) lease accounting estimates, (g) gift card/certificate breakage, (h) management fees charged to subsidiaries and affiliates, and (i) contingencies. Estimates are based on historical experience, current conditions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities when they are not readily apparent from other sources. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.




	(d) Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash




	The Company continually monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions in which it maintains its deposits and investments. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, we maintained balances in various cash accounts in excess of federally insured limits. All highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.




	Cash held related to the advertising funds and the Company’s gift card/certificate programs are classified as unrestricted cash as there are no legal restrictions on the use of these funds; however, the Company intends to use these funds solely to support the advertising funds and gift card/certificate programs rather than to fund operations. Total cash balances related to the advertising funds and gift card/certificate programs as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	 were


	$177.9 million


	 and


	$148.6 million


	, respectively.




	In accordance with the Company’s securitized financing facility, certain cash accounts have been established in the name of Citibank, N.A. (the “Trustee”) for the benefit of the Trustee and the noteholders, and are restricted in their use. The Company holds restricted cash which primarily represents (i) cash collections held by the Trustee, (ii) interest, principal, and commitment fee reserves held by the Trustee related to the Company’s Notes (see note 8), and (iii) real estate reserves used to pay real estate obligations. Changes in restricted cash accounts are presented as either a component of cash flows from operating or financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the restricted balance.




	(e) Fair value of financial instruments




	The carrying amounts of accounts receivable, notes and other receivables, assets and liabilities related to the advertising funds, accounts payable, and other current liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. For long-term receivables, we review the creditworthiness of the counterparty on a quarterly basis, and adjust the carrying value as necessary. We believe the carrying value of long-term receivables of


	$3.1 million


	 and


	$2.4 million


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, respectively, approximates fair value.




	Financial assets and liabilities are categorized, based on the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to the quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Observable market data, when available, is required to be used in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

	Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and

	 are summarized as follows (in thousands):

	The deferred compensation liabilities relate to the Dunkin’ Brands, Inc. non-qualified deferred compensation plans (“NQDC Plans”), which allow for pre-tax deferral of compensation for certain qualifying employees and directors (see note 18). Changes in the fair value of the deferred compensation liabilities are derived using quoted prices in active markets of the asset selections made by the participants. The deferred compensation liabilities are classified within Level 2, as defined under U.S. GAAP, because their inputs are derived principally from observable market data by correlation to hypothetical investments. The Company holds company-owned life insurance policies to partially offset the Company’s liabilities under the NQDC Plans. The changes in the fair value of any company-owned life insurance policies are derived using determinable cash surrender value. As such, the company-owned life insurance policies are classified within Level 2, as defined under U.S. GAAP.

	2,443,687

















	The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is estimated primarily based on current market rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities or current bid prices for our long-term debt. Judgment is required to develop these estimates. As such, our long-term debt is classified within Level 2, as defined under U.S. GAAP.




	(f) Inventories




	Inventories consist primarily of ice cream products sold to certain international markets that are in-transit from our third-party manufacturer to our international licensees, during which time we hold title to such products. The majority of ice cream products are purchased from one supplier. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, and cost is generally determined based on the actual cost of the specific inventory sold. Inventories are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.




	(g) Assets held for sale




	Assets held for sale primarily represent costs incurred by the Company for store equipment and leasehold improvements constructed for sale to franchisees, as well as restaurants formerly operated by franchisees or the Company waiting to be resold. The value of such restaurants and related assets is reduced to reflect net recoverable values, with such reductions recorded to general and administrative expenses, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Generally, internal specialists estimate the amount to be recovered from the sale of such assets based on their knowledge of the (a) market in which the store is located, (b) results of the Company’s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets, and (c) current economic conditions. The actual cost of such assets held for sale is affected by specific factors such as the nature, age, location, and condition of the assets, as well as the economic environment and inflation.




	We classify restaurants and their related assets as held for sale and suspend depreciation and amortization when (a) we make a decision to refranchise or sell the property, (b) the stores are available for immediate sale, (c) we have begun an active program to locate a buyer, (d) significant changes to the plan of sale are not likely, and (e) the sale is probable within one year. Assets held for sale are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.













	-


	 61


	-

















	As of


	December 26, 2015


	, prepaid expenses and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet included


	$8.8 million


	 of assets held for sale, which primarily consisted of property and equipment, net and goodwill. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, assets held for sale were immaterial.




	(h) Property and equipment




	Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term of the related asset. Estimated useful lives are as follows:





















	 






	Years








	Buildings






	20 – 35








	Leasehold improvements






	5 – 20








	Store, production, and other equipment






	3 – 10








	Software






	3 – 7










	Routine maintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Major improvements, additions, or replacements that extend the life, increase capacity, or improve the safety or the efficiency of property are capitalized at cost and depreciated. Major improvements to leased property are capitalized as leasehold improvements and depreciated. Interest costs incurred during the acquisition period of capital assets are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset and depreciated.




	(i) Leases




	When determining lease terms, we begin with the point at which the Company obtains control and possession of the leased properties. We include option periods for which failure to renew the lease imposes a penalty on the Company in such an amount that the renewal appears, at the inception of the lease, to be reasonably assured, which generally includes option periods through the end of the related franchise agreement term. We also include any rent holidays in the determination of the lease term.




	We record rent expense and rent income for leases and subleases, respectively, that contain scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the lease term as defined above. In certain cases, contingent rentals are based on sales levels of our franchisees, in excess of stipulated amounts. Contingent rentals are included in rent income and rent expense as they are earned or accrued, respectively.




	We occasionally provide to our sublessees, or receive from our landlords, tenant improvement dollars. Tenant improvement dollars paid to our sublessees are recorded as a deferred rent asset. For fixed asset and/or leasehold purchases for which we receive tenant improvement dollars from our landlords, we record the property and equipment and/or leasehold improvements gross and establish a deferred rent obligation. The deferred lease assets and obligations are amortized on a straight-line basis over the determined sublease and lease terms, respectively.




	Management regularly reviews sublease arrangements, where we are the lessor, for losses on sublease arrangements. We recognize a loss, discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates, when costs expected to be incurred under an operating prime lease exceed the anticipated future revenue stream of the operating sublease. Furthermore, for properties where we do not currently have an operational franchise or other third-party sublessee and are under long-term lease agreements, the present value of any remaining liability under the lease, discounted using credit-adjusted risk-free rates and net of estimated sublease recovery, is recognized as a liability and recorded as an operating expense at the time we cease use of the property. The value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is assessed for potential impairment (see note 2(j)).




	(j) Impairment of long-lived assets




	Long-lived assets that are used in operations are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through undiscounted future cash flows. Recognition and measurement of a potential impairment is performed on assets grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level where identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. An impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value. Fair value is generally estimated by internal specialists based on the present value of anticipated future cash flows or, if required, with the assistance of independent third-party valuation specialists, depending on the nature of the assets or asset group.

	(k) Equity method investments




	The Company’s equity method investments consist of interests in B-R 31 Ice Cream Co., Ltd. (“Japan JV”), BR-Korea Co., Ltd. (“South Korea JV”), and Palm Oasis Pty. Ltd. (“Australia JV”), which are accounted for in accordance with the equity method. The Company also previously accounted for an ownership interest in Coffee Alliance, S.L. (“Spain JV”) in accordance with the equity method, which interest was sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 (see note 6).




	The Company evaluates its equity method investments for impairment whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that may have a significant adverse impact on the fair value of the investment. If a loss in value has occurred and is deemed to be other than temporary, an impairment loss is recorded. Several factors are reviewed to determine whether a loss has occurred that is other than temporary, including absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment, the length and extent of the fair value decline, and the financial condition and future prospects of the investee.




	(l) Goodwill and other intangible assets




	Goodwill and trade names (“indefinite-lived intangibles”) have been assigned to our reporting units, which are also our operating segments, for purposes of impairment testing. All of our reporting units have indefinite-lived intangibles associated with them.




	We evaluate the remaining useful life of our trade names to determine whether current events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. In addition, all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that a trade name is impaired. In the event we were to determine that the carrying value of a trade name would more likely than not exceed its fair value, quantitative testing would be performed which consists of a comparison of the fair value of each trade name with its carrying value, with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recognized as an impairment loss. For goodwill, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. In the event we were to determine that a reporting unit’s carrying value would more likely than not exceed its fair value, quantitative testing would be performed which consists of a comparison of each reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. The fair value of a reporting unit is an estimate of the amount for which the unit as a whole could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value. We have selected the first day of our fiscal third quarter as the date on which to perform our annual impairment test for all indefinite-lived intangible assets. We also test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of such indefinite-lived intangibles has been impaired.




	Other intangible assets consist primarily of franchise and international license rights (“franchise rights”), ice cream distribution and territorial franchise agreement license rights (“license rights”), and operating lease interests acquired related to our prime leases and subleases (“operating leases acquired”). Franchise rights, license rights, and operating leases acquired recorded in the consolidated balance sheets were valued using an appropriate valuation method during the period of acquisition. Amortization of franchise rights, license rights, and favorable operating leases acquired is recorded as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations and amortized over the respective franchise, license, and lease terms using the straight-line method.




	Unfavorable operating leases acquired related to our prime and subleases are recorded in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized into rental expense and rental income, respectively, over the base lease term of the respective leases using the straight-line method. The weighted average amortization period for all unfavorable operating leases acquired is


	18


	 years.




	Management makes adjustments to the carrying amount of such intangible assets and unfavorable operating leases acquired if they are deemed to be impaired using the methodology for long-lived assets (see note 2(j)), or when such license or lease agreements are reduced or terminated.




	(m) Contingencies




	The Company records reserves for legal and other contingencies when information available to the Company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Predicting the outcomes of claims and litigation and estimating the related costs and exposures involve substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates. Legal costs incurred in connection with legal and other contingencies are expensed as the costs are incurred.

	-

















	(n) Foreign currency translation




	We translate assets and liabilities of non-U.S. operations into U.S. dollars at rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive loss and stockholders’ deficit, net of deferred taxes. Foreign currency translation adjustments primarily result from our equity method investments, as well as subsidiaries located in Canada, the UK, Australia, and other foreign jurisdictions. Transactions resulting in foreign exchange gains and losses are included in the consolidated statements of operations.




	(o) Revenue recognition




	Franchise fees and royalty income




	Domestically, the Company sells individual franchises as well as territory agreements in the form of store development agreements (“SDAs”) that grant the right to develop restaurants in designated areas. Our franchise agreements and SDAs typically require the franchisee to pay an initial nonrefundable fee and continuing fees, or royalty income, based upon a percentage of sales. The franchisee will typically pay us a renewal fee if we approve a renewal of the franchise agreement. Such fees are paid by franchisees to obtain the rights associated with these franchise agreements or SDAs. Initial franchise fee revenue is recognized upon substantial completion of the services required of the Company as stated in the franchise agreement, which is generally upon opening of the respective restaurant. Fees collected in advance are deferred until earned, with deferred amounts expected to be recognized as revenue within one year classified as current deferred income in the consolidated balance sheets. Royalty income is based on a percentage of franchisee gross sales and is recognized when earned, which occurs at the franchisees’ point of sale. Renewal fees are recognized when a renewal agreement with a franchisee becomes effective. Occasionally, the Company offers incentive programs to franchisees in conjunction with a franchise agreement, SDA, or renewal agreement and, when appropriate, records the costs of such programs as reductions of revenue.




	For our international business, we sell master territory and/or license agreements that typically allow the master licensee to either act as the franchisee or to sub-franchise to other operators. Master license and territory fees are generally recognized upon substantial completion of the services required of the Company as stated in the franchise agreement, which is generally upon opening of the first restaurant or as stores are opened, depending on the specific terms of the agreement. Royalty income is based on a percentage of franchisee gross sales and is recognized when earned, which generally occurs at the franchisees’ point of sale. Renewal fees are recognized when a renewal agreement with a franchisee or licensee becomes effective.




	Rental income




	Rental income for base rentals is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including the amortization of any tenant improvement dollars paid (see note 2(i)). The differences between the straight-line rent amounts and amounts receivable under the leases are recorded as deferred rent assets in current or long-term assets, as appropriate. Contingent rental income is recognized as earned, and any amounts received from lessees in advance of achieving stipulated thresholds are deferred until such thresholds are actually achieved. Deferred contingent rentals are recorded as deferred income in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.




	Sales of ice cream and other products




	We distribute Baskin-Robbins ice cream products and, in limited cases, Dunkin’ Donuts products to franchisees and licensees in certain international locations. Revenue from the sale of ice cream and other products is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the buyer, which is generally upon delivery.




	Sales at company-operated restaurants




	Retail store revenues at company-operated restaurants were recognized when payments were tendered at the point of sale, net of sales tax and other sales-related taxes. As of December 31, 2016, the Company did not own or operate any restaurants.




	Other revenues




	Other revenues include fees generated by licensing our brand names and other intellectual property, as well as gains, net of losses and transactions costs, from the sales of restaurants that were not company-operated to new or existing franchisees. Licensing fees are recognized when earned, which is generally upon sale of the underlying products by the licensees. Gains on the refranchise or sale of a restaurant are recognized when the sale transaction closes, the franchisee has a minimum amount of the purchase price in at-risk equity, and we are satisfied that the buyer can meet its financial obligations to us. If the criteria for gain recognition are not met, we defer the gain to the extent we have any remaining financial exposure in connection with the sale transaction. Deferred gains are recognized when the gain recognition criteria are met.













	-


	 64


	-

















	(p) Allowance for doubtful accounts




	We monitor the financial condition of our franchisees and licensees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees or licensees are unable to make their required payments. While we use the best information available in making our determination, the ultimate recovery of recorded receivables is also dependent upon future economic events and other conditions that may be beyond our control. Included in the allowance for doubtful notes and accounts receivables is a provision for uncollectible royalty, lease, ice cream, and licensing fee receivables.




	(q) Share-based payments




	We measure compensation cost at fair value on the date of grant for all share-based awards and recognize compensation expense over the service period that the awards are expected to vest. The Company has elected to recognize compensation cost for graded-vesting awards subject only to a service condition over the requisite service period of the entire award.




	(r) Income taxes




	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future tax consequences of items that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply in years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The effects of changes in tax rates and changes in apportionment of income between tax jurisdictions on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the year in which the law is enacted or change in apportionment occurs. Valuation allowances are provided when the Company does not believe it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of identified tax assets.




	A tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Estimates of interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in the provision for income taxes.




	(s) Comprehensive income




	Comprehensive income is primarily comprised of net income, foreign currency translation adjustments, and gains and losses on interest rate swaps, and is reported in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, net of taxes, for all periods presented. Additionally, comprehensive income included pension gains and losses for fiscal years 2015 and 2014. As a result of the final settlement of the pension plan in fiscal year 2015, no pension gains and losses were recorded in 2016 (see note 18).




	(t) Debt issuance costs




	Debt issuance costs represent capitalizable costs incurred related to the issuance and refinancing of the Company’s long-term debt (see note 8). As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, debt issuance costs of


	$29.3 million


	 and


	$35.7 million


	, respectively, are included in long-term debt, net in the consolidated balance sheets, and are being amortized over the remaining maturities of the debt, based on projected required repayments, using the effective interest rate method.




	(u) Gift card/certificate breakage




	The Company and our franchisees sell gift cards that are redeemable for product in our Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins restaurants. The Company manages the gift card program, and therefore collects all funds from the activation of gift cards and reimburses franchisees for the redemption of gift cards in their restaurants. A liability for unredeemed gift cards, as well as historical gift certificates sold, is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.




	There are no expiration dates on our gift cards, and we do not charge any service fees. While our franchisees continue to honor all gift cards presented for payment, we may determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain cards due to long periods of inactivity. In these circumstances, we may recognize income from unredeemed gift cards (“breakage income”) if they are not subject to unclaimed property laws.




	For Dunkin’ Donuts gift cards enrolled in the DD Perks® Rewards loyalty program and other cards with expected similar redemption behavior, breakage is estimated and recognized at the point in time when the likelihood of redemption of any remaining card balance becomes remote, generally after a period of sufficient inactivity. Breakage on all other Dunkin’ Donuts gift cards and all Baskin-Robbins gift cards is estimated and recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions, based on historical redemption rates. The Company recognizes breakage as income only up to the amount of gift card program costs. Any incremental breakage on Dunkin' Donuts gift cards that exceeds gift card program costs is committed to fund future













	-


	 65


	-

















	initiatives that will benefit the Dunkin’ Donuts gift card program or to offset future gift card program costs. Any incremental breakage on Baskin-Robbins gift cards that exceeds gift card program costs is committed to fund future sales-driving initiatives for the benefit of Baskin-Robbins franchisees. The incremental breakage in excess of gift card program costs is recorded as a gift card breakage liability within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (see note 10).




	For fiscal years


	2016


	,


	2015


	, and


	2014


	, total breakage income recognized on gift cards, as well as historical gift certificate programs, was


	$22.3 million


	,


	$15.9 million


	, and


	$8.5 million


	, respectively, and is recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses, net, to offset the related gift card program costs.




	(v) Concentration of credit risk




	The Company is subject to credit risk through its accounts receivable consisting primarily of amounts due from franchisees and licensees for franchise fees, royalty income, and sales of ice cream and other products. In addition, we have note and lease receivables from certain of our franchisees and licensees. The financial condition of these franchisees and licensees is largely dependent upon the underlying business trends of our brands and market conditions within the quick service restaurant industry. This concentration of credit risk is mitigated, in part, by the large number of franchisees and licensees of each brand and the short-term nature of the franchise and license fee and lease receivables. At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	,


	one


	 master licensee, including its majority-owned subsidiaries, accounted for approximately


	15%


	 and


	13%


	, respectively, of total accounts and notes receivable. For fiscal year 2014,


	one


	 master licensee, including its majority-owned subsidiaries, accounted for approximately


	10%


	 of total revenues.


	No


	 individual franchisee or master licensee accounted for more than


	10%


	 of total revenues for fiscal years


	2016


	 or


	2015


	.




	Additionally, the Company engages various third parties to manufacture and/or distribute certain Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins products under licensing arrangements. As of


	December 26, 2015


	,


	one


	 of these third parties accounted for approximately


	13%


	 of total accounts and notes receivable. No individual third party accounted for more than 10% of total accounts and notes receivable as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	(w) Recent accounting pronouncements




	In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued new guidance for goodwill impairment which requires only a single-step quantitative test to identify and measure impairment and record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value. The option to perform a qualitative assessment first for a reporting unit to determine if a quantitative impairment test is necessary does not change under the new guidance. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2020 with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance in fiscal year 2017. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.




	In November 2016, the FASB issued new guidance addressing diversity in practice that exists in the classification and presentation of changes in restricted cash in the statements of cash flows. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance retrospectively beginning in fiscal year 2017. Upon adoption, restricted cash will be combined with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning and end of period balances in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and the current presentation of changes in restricted cash within operating and financing activities will be eliminated. Upon adoption of this guidance, net cash provided by operating activities will be reduced by


	$2.1 million


	 and will increase by


	$65.7 million


	 for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, and net cash used in financing activities will increase by


	$106 thousand


	 and will be reduced by


	$6.8 million


	 for fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The adoption of this guidance will have no impact on the consolidated statements of operations and balance sheets.




	In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance for employee share-based compensation which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including excess tax benefits, forfeiture estimates, statutory tax withholding requirements, and classification in the statements of cash flows. This guidance is effective for the Company in fiscal year 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year 2017. Upon adoption, any future excess tax benefits or deficiencies will be recorded to the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations instead of additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, excess tax benefits will be presented retrospectively as an operating cash inflow instead of a financing cash inflow in the statements of cash flows. During fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014,


	$2.7 million


	,


	$11.5 million


	, and 


	$10.8 million


	, respectively, of excess tax benefits were recorded to additional paid-in capital that would have been recorded as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, and such amounts would have been classified as operating cash inflows instead of financing cash inflows in the consolidated statements of cash flows, if this new guidance had been adopted as of the respective dates.




	In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance for lease accounting, which replaces existing lease accounting guidance. The new guidance aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring lessees to recognize lease













	-


	 66


	-

















	assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requiring disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for the Company in fiscal year 2019 with early adoption permitted, and modified retrospective application is required. The Company expects to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year 2019 and is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company expects that substantially all of its operating lease commitments (see note 11) will be subject to the new guidance and will be recognized as operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets upon adoption.




	In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance for revenue recognition related to contracts with customers, except for contracts within the scope of other standards, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance. The new guidance provides a single framework in which revenue is required to be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for the Company in fiscal year 2018 with early adoption permitted in fiscal year 2017. The Company expects to adopt this new guidance in fiscal year 2018 using the full retrospective transition method, which will result in restating each prior reporting period presented in the year of adoption. The Company expects the adoption of the new guidance to change the timing of recognition of initial franchise fees, including master license and territory fees for our international business, and renewal fees. Currently, these fees are generally recognized upfront upon either opening of the respective restaurant or when a renewal agreement becomes effective. The new guidance will generally require these fees to be recognized over the term of the related franchise license for the respective restaurant, which we expect will result in a material impact to revenue recognized for franchise fees and renewal fees. The Company does not expect this new guidance to materially impact the recognition of royalty income, rental income, or sales of ice cream and other products. The Company is continuing to evaluate the impact the adoption of this new guidance will have on these and other revenue transactions, as well as the presentation of advertising fund revenues and expenses, in addition to the impact on accounting policies and related disclosures.

	(4) Advertising funds




	On behalf of the Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins domestic advertising funds, the Company collects a percentage, which is generally


	5%


	, of gross retail sales from Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins domestic franchisees to be used for various forms of advertising for each brand. In most of our international markets, franchisees manage their own advertising expenditures, which are not included in the advertising fund results.




	The Company administers and directs the development of all advertising and promotional programs in the advertising funds for which it collects advertising fees, in accordance with the provisions of our franchise agreements. The Company acts as, in substance, an agent with regard to these advertising contributions. We consolidate and report all assets and liabilities held by these advertising funds as restricted assets of advertising funds and liabilities of advertising funds within current assets and current liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets. The assets and liabilities held by these advertising funds consist primarily of receivables, prepaid expenses, payables, accrued expenses, and any cumulative surplus or deficit related specifically to the advertising funds. The revenues, expenses, and cash flows of the advertising funds are not included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows because the Company does not have complete discretion over the usage of the funds. Contributions to these advertising funds are restricted to advertising, product development, public relations, merchandising, and administrative expenses and programs to increase sales and further enhance the public reputation of each of the brands.




	At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, the Company had a net payable of


	$11.9 million


	 and


	$11.6 million


	, respectively, to the various advertising funds.




	To cover administrative expenses of the advertising funds, the Company charges each advertising fund a management fee for items such as facilities, accounting services, information technology, data processing, product development, legal, administrative support services, and other operating expenses, as well as share-based compensation expense for employees that provide services directly to the advertising funds. Management fees totaled


	$9.5 million


	,


	$9.7 million


	, and


	$7.6 million


	 for fiscal years


	2016


	,


	2015


	, and


	2014


	, respectively. Such management fees are included in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction in general and administrative expenses, net.




	The Company made discretionary contributions to certain advertising funds for the purpose of supplementing national and regional advertising in certain markets of


	$1.7 million


	 for each of the fiscal years


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, and


	$2.1 million


	 for fiscal year


	2014


	, respectively. Additionally, the Company made net contributions to the advertising funds based on retail sales of company-operated restaurants of


	$596 thousand


	,


	$1.3 million


	, and


	$872 thousand


	 for fiscal years


	2016


	,


	2015


	, and


	2014


	, respectively, which are included in company-operated restaurant expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal years


	2016


	,


	2015


	, and 2014, the Company also funded advertising fund initiatives of


	$3.4 million


	,


	$2.3 million


	, and


	$5.2 million


	, respectively, which were contributed from the gift card breakage liability included within other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets (see note 2(u) and note 10).

	During fiscal year 2015, the Company assessed if there was an other-than-temporary loss in value of its investment in the Japan JV based on various factors, including continued declines in the operating performance and reduced future expectations of the Baskin-Robbins business in Japan, as well as an announced reconsideration of the amount of semi-annual dividend payments by the Japan JV. Accordingly, the Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist to assist the Company in determining the fair value of its investment in the Japan JV. The valuation of the investment was determined using a combination of market and income approaches to valuation. Based in part on the fair value determined by the independent third-party valuation specialist, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the investment in the Japan JV exceeded fair value by


	$54.3 million


	 and that this reduction in value was other-than-temporary. As such, the Company recorded an impairment charge for that amount in fiscal year 2015.




	The impairment of the Japan JV is reflected as a reduction to the Company’s equity method investments in the consolidated balance sheets. As the Company had previously recorded a step-up in the basis of our investment in the Japan JV comprising amortizable franchise rights and nonamortizable goodwill, the impairment was first allocated to fully impair these investor-level assets. The remaining impairment was recorded to the underlying assets of the Japan JV by fully impairing the underlying property, plant, and equipment, net of any related tax impact, with any residual impairment allocated ratably to other non-financial long-term assets.

	Securitized Financing Facility




	On


	January 26, 2015


	, DB Master Finance LLC (the “Master Issuer”), a limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of DBGI, entered into a base indenture and a related supplemental indenture (collectively, the “Indenture”) under which the Master Issuer may issue multiple series of notes. On the same date, the Master Issuer issued Series 2015-1


	3.262%


	 Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-I (the “Class A-2-I Notes”) with an initial principal amount of


	$750.0 million


	 and Series 2015-1


	3.980%


	 Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes, Class A-2-II (the “Class A-2-II Notes” and, together with the Class A-2-I Notes, the “Class A-2 Notes”) with an initial principal amount of


	$1.75 billion


	. In addition, the Master Issuer also issued Series 2015-1 Variable Funding Senior Secured Notes, Class A-1 (the “Variable Funding Notes” and, together with the Class A-2 Notes, the “Notes”), which allows the Master Issuer to borrow up to


	$100.0 million


	 on a revolving basis. The Variable Funding Notes may also be used to issue letters of credit. The Notes were issued in a securitization transaction pursuant to which most of the Company’s domestic and certain of its foreign revenue-generating assets, consisting principally of franchise-related agreements, real estate assets, and intellectual property and license agreements for the use of intellectual property, are held by the Master Issuer and certain other limited-purpose, bankruptcy-remote, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company that act as guarantors of the Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets to secure the Notes.













	-


	 71


	-

















	The legal final maturity date of the Class A-2 Notes is in


	February 2045


	, but it is anticipated that, unless earlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the Class A-2-I Notes will be repaid in


	February 2019


	 and the Class A-2-II Notes will be repaid in


	February 2022


	 (the “Anticipated Repayment Dates”). If the Class A-2 Notes have not been repaid in full by their respective Anticipated Repayment Dates, a rapid amortization event will occur in which residual net cash flows of the Master Issuer, after making certain required payments, will be applied to the outstanding principal of the Class A-2 Notes. Various other events, including failure to maintain a minimum ratio of net cash flows to debt service (“DSCR”), may also cause a rapid amortization event. Borrowings under the Class A-2-I and Class A-2-II Notes bear interest at a fixed rate equal to


	3.262%


	 and


	3.980%


	, respectively. If the Class A-2 Notes are not repaid or refinanced prior to their respective Anticipated Repayment Dates, incremental interest will accrue. Principal payments are required to be made on the Class A-2-I and Class A-2-II Notes equal to


	$7.5 million


	 and


	$17.5 million


	, respectively, per calendar year, payable in quarterly installments. No principal payments will be required if a specified leverage ratio, which is a measure of outstanding debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain items (as specified in the Indenture), is less than or equal to


	5.0


	 to 1.0, though the Company may elect to continue to make principal payments. Other events and transactions, such as certain asset sales and receipt of various insurance or indemnification proceeds, may trigger additional mandatory prepayments.




	It is anticipated that the principal and interest on the Variable Funding Notes will be repaid in full on or prior to


	February 2020


	, subject to


	two


	 additional


	one


	-year extensions. Borrowings under the Variable Funding Notes bear interest at a rate equal to a base rate, a LIBOR rate plus


	2.25%


	, or the lenders’ commercial paper funding rate plus


	2.25%


	. If the Variable Funding Notes are not repaid prior to February 2020 or prior to the end of an extension period, if applicable, incremental interest will accrue. In addition, the Company is required to pay a


	2.25%


	 fee for letters of credit amounts outstanding and a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Variable Funding Notes which ranges from


	0.50%


	 to


	1.00%


	 based on utilization.




	Total debt issuance costs incurred and capitalized in connection with the issuance of the Notes were


	$41.3 million


	. The effective interest rate, including the amortization of debt issuance costs, was


	3.5%


	 and


	4.3%


	 for the Class A-2-I Notes and Class A-2-II Notes, respectively, at


	December 31, 2016


	.




	Total amortization of debt issuance costs related to the securitized financing facility was


	$6.4 million


	 and


	$5.6 million


	 for fiscal years


	2016


	 and


	2015


	, respectively, which is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	,


	$25.9 million


	 and


	$26.3 million


	, respectively, of letters of credit were outstanding against the Variable Funding Notes, which relate primarily to interest reserves required under the Indenture. There were


	no


	 amounts drawn down on these letters of credit as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	.




	The Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Master Issuer maintains specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments, including mandatory prepayments in the event of a change of control as defined in the Indenture and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective, and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information, and similar matters. As noted above, the Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure to maintain stated DSCR, failure to maintain an aggregate level of Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. retail sales on certain measurement dates, certain manager termination events, an event of default, and the failure to repay or refinance the Class A-2 Notes on the applicable scheduled maturity date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal, or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties, failure of security interests to be effective, and certain judgments.




	Senior credit facility




	In February 2014, Dunkin’ Brands, Inc. (“DBI”), a subsidiary of DBGI, amended its senior credit facility, resulting in a reduction of interest rates. As a result, during the first quarter of 2014, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment and refinancing transactions of


	$13.7 million


	, including


	$10.5 million


	 related to the write-off of original issuance discount and debt issuance costs and


	$3.2 million


	 of fees paid to third parties.




	The proceeds from the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes were used to repay the remaining principal outstanding on the term loans. During fiscal year 2015, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of


	$20.6 million


	, consisting primarily of the write-off of the remaining original issuance discount and debt issuance costs related to the term loans.

	(9) Derivative instruments and hedging transactions




	The Company’s hedging instruments have historically consisted solely of interest rate swaps to hedge the Company’s variable-rate term loans. In September 2012, the Company entered into variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk of increases in cash flows (interest payments) attributable to increases in three-month LIBOR above the designated benchmark interest rate being hedged, through November 2017. As a result of the February 2014 amendment to the senior credit facility (see note 8), the Company amended the interest rate swap agreements to align the embedded floors with the amended term loans. As of the date of the amendment, a pre-tax gain of


	$5.8 million


	 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.




	Effective


	December 23, 2014


	, the Company terminated all interest rate swap agreements with its counterparties in anticipation of the securitization transaction and related repayment of the outstanding term loans (see note 8). In fiscal years 2014 and 2015, the Company received total cash proceeds equivalent to fair value of the interest rate swaps at the termination date of


	$5.3 million


	, which was net of accrued interest owed to the counterparties of


	$1.0 million


	. Upon termination, cash flow hedge accounting was discontinued and the cumulative pre-tax gain of


	$1.8 million


	 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.




	As of


	December 27, 2014


	, a pre-tax gain of


	$6.2 million


	 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which included the gain related to both the February 2014 amendment and December 2014 termination. This pre-tax gain is being amortized on a straight-line basis to interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations through November 23, 2017, the original maturity date of the swaps. The Company estimates that


	$1.9 million


	 will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss as a reduction of interest expense in fiscal year 2017.

	(11) Leases




	The Company is the lessee on certain land leases (the Company leases the land and erects a building) or improved leases (lessor owns the land and building) covering restaurants and other properties. In addition, the Company has leased and subleased land and buildings to others. Many of these leases and subleases provide for future rent escalation and renewal options. In addition, contingent rentals, determined as a percentage of annual sales by our franchisees, are stipulated in certain prime lease and sublease agreements. The Company is generally obligated for the cost of property taxes, insurance, and maintenance relating to these leases. Such costs are typically charged to the sublessee based on the terms of the sublease agreements. The Company also leases certain office equipment and a fleet of automobiles under noncancelable operating leases. Included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets are the following amounts related to capital leases (in thousands):

	(12) Segment information




	The Company is strategically aligned into


	two


	 global brands, Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins, which are further segregated between U.S. operations and international operations. As such, the Company has determined that it has


	four


	 operating segments, which are its reportable segments: Dunkin’ Donuts U.S., Dunkin’ Donuts International, Baskin-Robbins U.S., and Baskin-Robbins International. Dunkin’ Donuts U.S., Baskin-Robbins U.S., and Dunkin’ Donuts International primarily derive their revenues through royalty income and franchise fees. Baskin-Robbins U.S. also derives revenue through license fees from a third-party license agreement and rental income. Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. also derives revenue through rental income. Prior to the sale of remaining company-operated restaurants in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. also derived revenue through retail sales at company-operated restaurants. Baskin-Robbins International primarily derives its revenues from sales of ice cream products, as well as royalty income, franchise fees, and license fees. The operating results of each segment are regularly reviewed and evaluated separately by the Company’s senior management, which includes, but is not limited to, the chief executive officer. Senior management primarily evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on operating income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets, long-lived asset impairment charges, impairment of our joint ventures, and other infrequent or unusual charges, which does not reflect the allocation of any corporate charges. This profitability measure is referred to as segment profit. When senior management reviews a balance sheet, it is at a consolidated level. The accounting policies applicable to each segment are generally consistent with those used in the consolidated financial statements.




	Beginning in fiscal year 2016, certain segment profit amounts in the tables below have been reclassified as a result of the realignment of the Company’s organizational structure to better support its segment operations, including the allocation of previously unallocated costs. Additionally, revenues and segment profit amounts related to restaurants located in Puerto Rico were previously included in the Dunkin' Donuts International and Baskin-Robbins International segments, but are now included in the Dunkin' Donuts U.S. and Baskin-Robbins U.S. segments based on functional responsibility. Prior year amounts in the tables below have been revised to reflect these changes for all periods presented.




	Revenues for all operating segments include only transactions with unaffiliated customers and include no intersegment revenues. Revenues reported as “Other” include revenues earned through certain licensing arrangements with third parties in which our brand names are used, including the licensing fees earned from the Dunkin’ K-Cup® pod licensing agreement, revenues generated from online training programs for franchisees, and revenues from the sale of Dunkin’ Donuts products in certain international markets, all of which are not allocated to a specific segment. Revenues by segment were as follows (in thousands):

	(14) Equity incentive plans




	The Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. 2015 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”) was adopted in May 2015, and is the only plan under which the Company currently grants awards. A maximum of


	6,200,000


	 shares of common stock may be delivered in satisfaction of awards under the 2015 Plan. Prior to the 2015 Plan, the Company granted awards under the Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. 2011 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan”) and the 2006 Executive Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2006 Plan”).

	Time-vested stock options




	Time-vested stock options granted under the 2006 Plan, 2011 Plan, and 2015 Plan vest in equal annual amounts over either a


	4


	- or


	5


	-year period subsequent to the grant date, and as such are subject to a service condition, and also fully vest upon a change of control. The requisite service period over which compensation cost is being recognized is either


	4


	 or


	5


	 years. The maximum contractual term of the stock options is


	7


	 or


	10


	 years.




	The fair value of time-vested stock options were estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model is impacted by the Company’s stock price and certain assumptions related to the Company’s stock and employees’ exercise behavior. The following weighted average assumptions were utilized in determining the fair value of the 2015 Plan options granted during fiscal year


	2016


	 and the 2011 Plan options granted during fiscal years


	2015


	 and

	4.96

















	The expected term was primarily estimated utilizing the simplified method. We utilized the simplified method because the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term. The risk-free interest rate assumption was based on yields of U.S. Treasury securities in effect at the date of grant with terms similar to the expected term. Expected volatility was estimated based on historical volatility of peer companies over a period equivalent to the expected term, as well as considering the Company’s historical volatility since its initial public offering. Additionally, the dividend yield was estimated based on dividends currently being paid on the underlying common stock at the date of grant. Estimated and actual forfeitures have not had a material impact on share-based compensation expense.

	The Company typically grants restricted stock units to certain employees and non-employee members of our board of directors. Restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest in three equal installments on each of the first three annual anniversaries of the grant date. Restricted stock units granted to our non-employee members of our board of directors generally vest in one installment on the first anniversary of the grant date.

	, there was


	$5.3 million


	 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately

	, respectively.




	2011 Plan restricted shares




	During fiscal year 2014, the Company granted restricted shares of


	27,096


	. The restricted shares vested in full on


	July 31, 2016


	 based on a service condition, and had a grant-date fair value of


	$51.67


	 per share, which was determined on the date of grant based on the Company


	’


	s closing stock price. During fiscal year 2015, the Company granted restricted shares of


	21,101


	. The restricted shares vest in equal installments in


	February 2018 and 2019


	 based on a service condition, and have a grant-date fair value of


	$47.39


	 per share, which was determined on the date of grant based on the Company


	’


	s closing stock price. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there was


	$528 thousand


	 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to these restricted shares, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately


	2.1


	 years.




	In addition, during fiscal year 2014, the Company granted


	150,000


	 contingently issuable restricted shares. The contingently issuable restricted shares are eligible to vest on


	December 31, 2018


	, subject to a service condition and a market vesting condition linked to the level of total shareholder return received by the Company’s shareholders during the performance period measured against the median total shareholder return of the companies in the S&P 500 Composite Index. The contingently issuable restricted shares were valued based on a Monte Carlo simulation model to reflect the impact of the total shareholder return market condition, resulting in a grant-date fair value of


	$37.94


	 per share. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, there was


	$2.3 million


	 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to these restricted shares, which is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately


	2.0


	 years.




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	,


	171,101


	 2011 Plan restricted shares remained unvested. The total grant-date fair value of restricted shares vested during fiscal year


	2016


	 was


	$1.4 million


	.




	Performance stock units




	The Company granted


	121,030


	 performance stock units (“PSUs”) to certain employees during fiscal year


	2016


	, which are generally eligible to cliff-vest approximately three years from the grant date. Of the total PSUs granted,


	39,684


	 PSUs are subject to a service condition and a market vesting condition linked to the level of total shareholder return received by the Company


	’


	s shareholders during the performance period measured against the companies in the S&P 500 Composite Index (“TSR PSUs”). The remaining


	81,346


	 PSUs granted are subject to a service condition and a performance vesting condition based on the level of adjusted operating income growth achieved over the performance period (“AOI PSUs”). The maximum vesting percentage that could be realized for each of the TSR PSUs and the AOI PSUs is


	200%


	 based on the level of performance achieved for the respective awards. All of the PSUs are also subject to a one-year post-vesting holding period. The TSR PSUs were valued based on a Monte Carlo simulation model to reflect the impact of the total shareholder return market condition, resulting in a weighted average grant-date fair value of


	$55.36


	 per share. The probability of satisfying a market condition is considered in the estimation of the grant-date fair value for TSR PSUs and the compensation cost is not reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the requisite service has been provided. The AOI PSUs have a weighted average grant-date fair value of


	$44.22


	 per share. Total compensation cost for the AOI PSUs is determined based on the most likely outcome of the performance condition and the number of awards expected to vest based on the outcome.

	The increase in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 resulting from the impairment of our investment in the Japan JV resulted from the corresponding reduction in income before income taxes but for which there is no corresponding tax benefit.




	During fiscal year 2014, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of


	$7.0 million


	 related to the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, net of federal and state tax benefit as applicable, for which settlement with the taxing authorities was reached or were otherwise deemed effectively settled. Additionally during fiscal year 2014, the Company recorded a net tax benefit of


	$8.5 million


	 related to the restructuring of our Canadian subsidiaries, which included a legal entity conversion of Dunkin’ Brands Canada, Ltd. (“DBCL”) to a British Columbia unlimited liability company. The net tax benefit from the Canadian legal entity conversion resulted primarily from a worthless securities deduction for the tax basis of DBCL and the revaluation of DBCL’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at the applicable U.S. deferred tax rate, partially offset by income recognized for the tax basis of DBCL’s assets.

	Deferred tax assets for certain foreign jurisdictions totaling


	$5.1 million


	 and


	$5.6 million


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, respectively, are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had


	$8.5 million


	 of unused foreign tax credits, which expire in fiscal years 2021 through 2026. At


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards in certain international jurisdictions of approximately


	$7.1 million


	 and


	$1.1 million


	, respectively, and recorded deferred tax assets of


	$1.1 million


	 and


	$0.2 million


	, respectively, net of valuation allowance, related to such loss carryforwards.




	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income, and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes, as of


	December 31, 2016


	, with the exception of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards attributable to certain of our foreign subsidiaries for which valuation allowances have been recorded, it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets.




	The Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability of


	$7.7 million


	 for the undistributed earnings of foreign operations, net of foreign tax credits, relating to our foreign joint ventures that arose in fiscal year


	2016


	 and prior years because the Company currently does not expect those unremitted earnings to reverse and become taxable to the Company in the foreseeable future. A deferred tax liability will be recognized when the Company is no longer able to demonstrate that it plans to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, the undistributed earnings of these joint ventures were approximately


	$132.9 million


	 and


	$128.2 million


	, respectively.




	The Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability of


	$13.3 million


	 for the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since such earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, the amount of cash associated with indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings was approximately


	$24.5 million


	 and


	$18.3 million


	, respectively. If in the future we decide to repatriate such foreign earnings, we could incur incremental U.S. federal and state income tax. However, our intent is to keep these funds indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.




	At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions was


	$2.3 million


	 and


	$2.7 million


	, respectively. At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, the Company had approximately


	$1.1 million


	 and


	$1.3 million


	, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company recorded net income tax benefits of $


	0.2 million


	 and


	$2.3 million


	 during fiscal years


	2016


	 and


	2014


	,

	respectively, and net income tax expense of


	$0.1 million


	 during fiscal year

	 for potential interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, there were $


	1.3 million


	 and


	$1.1 million


	, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the annual effective tax rate.




	The Company’s major tax jurisdictions subject to income tax are the United States and Canada. For Canada, the Company has open tax years dating back to tax years ended December 2010 and finalized its audit for the tax periods 2009 through 2012 during fiscal year 2014. In the United States, the Company has open tax years dating back to tax years ended December 2013 and have been audited by the IRS through fiscal 2010. The Company is currently under audit in limited jurisdictions for tax years beginning after December 2010.

	(17) Commitments and contingencies




	(a) Lease commitments





	The Company is party to various leases for property, including land and buildings, leased automobiles, and office equipment under noncancelable operating and capital lease arrangements (see note 11).




	(b) Supply chain guarantees




	The Company has various supply chain agreements that provide for purchase commitments, the majority of which result in the Company being contingently liable upon early termination of the agreement. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, the Company was contingently liable under such supply chain agreements for approximately


	$136.2 million


	 and


	$157.8 million


	, respectively. For certain supply chain commitments, as product is purchased by the Company’s franchisees over the term of the agreement, the amount of the guarantee is reduced. The Company assesses the risk of performing under each of these guarantees on a quarterly basis, and, based on various factors including internal forecasts, prior history, and ability to extend contract terms, we accrued an immaterial amount of reserves related to supply chain commitments as of


	December 31, 2016


	, which is included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. There was


	no


	 accrual required as of


	December 26, 2015


	 related to these commitments.




	(c) Letters of credit




	At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, the Company had standby letters of credit outstanding for a total of


	$25.9 million


	 and


	$26.3 million


	, respectively. There were


	no


	 amounts drawn down on these letters of credit.




	(d) Legal matters




	In May 2003, a group of Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees from Quebec, Canada filed a lawsuit against the Company on a variety of claims,


	 including but not limited to, alleging that the Company breached its franchise agreements and provided inadequate management and support to Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees in Quebec (the “Bertico litigation”). In June 2012, the Quebec Superior Court found for the plaintiffs and issued a judgment against the Company in the amount of approximately


	C$16.4 million


	, plus costs and interest, representing loss in value of the franchises and lost profits. The Company appealed the decision, and in April 2015, the Quebec Court of Appeals (Montreal) ruled to reduce the damages to approximately


	C$10.9 million


	, plus costs and interest. Similar claims have also been made against the Company by other former Dunkin’ Donuts franchisees in Canada. As a result of the Bertico litigation appellate ruling and assessment of similar claims, the Company reduced its aggregate legal reserves for the Bertico litigation and similar claims by approximately


	$2.8 million


	 during fiscal













	-


	 85


	-

















	year 2015, which is recorded within general and administrative expenses, net in the consolidated statements of operations. During fiscal year 2016, the Company reached a final agreement on costs and interest with the plaintiffs in the Bertico litigation, and paid approximately 


	C$17.4 million


	 with respect to this matter, which represented the full amounts owed to the plaintiffs.




	Additionally, the Company is engaged in several matters of litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business as a franchisor. Such matters include disputes related to compliance with the terms of franchise and development agreements, including claims or threats of claims of breach of contract, negligence, and other alleged violations by the Company. At


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, contingent liabilities totaling


	$5.6 million


	 and


	$18.3 million


	, respectively, were included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets to reflect the Company’s estimate of the probable losses which may be incurred in connection with all outstanding litigation.








	(18) Retirement plans




	401(k) Plan




	Employees of the Company, excluding employees of certain international subsidiaries and certain employees of company-operated stores, are eligible to participate in a defined contribution retirement plan, the Dunkin’ Brands 401(k) Retirement Plan (“401(k) Plan”), under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, employees may contribute up to


	80%


	 of their pre-tax eligible compensation, not to exceed the annual limits set by the IRS. The 401(k) Plan allows the Company to match participants’ contributions in an amount determined at the sole discretion of the Company. The Company matched participants’ contributions during fiscal years


	2016


	,


	2015


	, and


	2014


	, up to a maximum of


	4%


	 of the employee’s eligible compensation. Employer contributions totaled


	$3.3 million


	 for fiscal year


	2016


	 and


	$3.2 million


	 for each of the fiscal years


	2015


	 and 2014.




	NQDC Plans




	The Company also offers certain qualifying individuals, as defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), the ability to participate in the NQDC Plans. The NQDC Plans allow for pre-tax contributions of up to


	50%


	 of a participant’s base annual salary and other forms of compensation, as defined. The Company credits the amounts deferred with earnings and holds investments in company-owned life insurance policies to partially offset the Company’s liabilities under the NQDC Plans. The NQDC Plans liability, included in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, was


	$11.1 million


	 and


	$9.1 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, respectively. As of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, total investments held for the NQDC Plans were


	$9.3 million


	 and


	$5.8 million


	, respectively, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.




	Canadian Pension Plan




	The Company sponsored a contributory defined benefit pension plan in Canada, The Baskin-Robbins Employees’ Pension Plan (“Canadian Pension Plan”), which provided retirement benefits for the majority of its Canadian employees.




	During fiscal year 2012, the Company’s board of directors approved a plan to close the Peterborough, Ontario, Canada manufacturing plant, where the majority of the Canadian Pension Plan participants were employed. As a result of the closure, the Company terminated the Canadian Pension Plan in fiscal year 2012, and the Financial Services Commission of Ontario approved the termination of the plan in fiscal year


	2014


	. During fiscal year 2015, the Company completed the final settlement of the plan by funding the plan deficit and distributing substantially all plan assets through lump-sum distributions to participants and the purchase of annuities. The settlement of the Canadian Pension Plan resulted in the recognition of a loss of


	$4.1 million


	, which was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to general and administrative expenses, net during fiscal year 2015.

	, the Company had


	$1.1 million


	 of royalties receivable from its equity method investees, which were recorded in accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, in the consolidated balance sheets.




	The Company made net payments to its equity method investees totaling approximately


	$3.2 million


	 in each of the fiscal years


	2016


	 and


	2015

	As of


	December 26, 2015

	 of notes receivable from the Spain JV, which were fully reserved, and are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. Upon sale of the Company's ownership interest in the Spain JV in fiscal year 2016 (see note 6), the Company recovered approximately

	 in notes receivable repayments.

	Controls and Procedures.







	Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), that are designed to ensure that information that would be required to be disclosed in Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.









	We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of


	December 31, 2016


	. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of


	December 31, 2016


	, such disclosure controls and procedures were effective.




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.









	Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process, designed by, or under the supervision of the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and disposition of assets; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made only in accordance with management and board authorizations; and providing reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.









	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.









	Management, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	 based on the framework and criteria established in


	Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013)


	, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring

	-

















	Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls, and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of


	December 31, 2016


	.









	Our independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm









	The Board of Directors and Stockholders




	Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc.:




	We have audited Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc.and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	, based on criteria established in


	 Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013)


	 issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. and subsidiaries’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying


	Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting


	. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.









	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.









	A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.









	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.









	In our opinion, Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of


	December 31, 2016


	, based on criteria established in


	 Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013)


	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).









	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. and subsidiaries as of


	December 31, 2016


	 and


	December 26, 2015


	, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended


	December 31, 2016


	, and our report dated


	February 21, 2017


	 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

	DUNKIN’ BRANDS GROUP, INC.

	2015 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN




	NON-STATUTORY STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT









	This agreement (the “


	Agreement


	”) is made effective as of the [●]th day of [●], [●] (the “


	Grant Date


	”), between Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “


	Company


	”), and [●] (the “


	Participant


	”), and evidences a stock option granted by the Company to the Participant pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. 2015 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (as amended from time to time, the “


	Plan


	”).









	1.


	Grant of Stock Option


	. The Company grants to the Participant on the Grant Date an option (the “


	Stock Option


	”) to purchase, on the terms provided herein and in the Plan (including, without limitation, the exercise provisions in Section 6(b)(3) of the Plan), the number of shares of Stock of the Company set forth above with an exercise price per share of Stock as set forth above, in each case subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 7 of the Plan in respect of transactions occurring after the date hereof.




	The Stock Option evidenced by this Agreement is a non-statutory option (that is, an option that is not to be treated as a stock option described in subsection (b) of Section 422 of the Code) and is granted to the Participant in connection with the Participant’s employment by the Company and its qualifying subsidiaries. For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, “qualifying subsidiary” means a subsidiary of the Company as to which the Company has a “controlling interest” as described in Treas. Regs. §1.409A-1(b)(5)(iii)(E)(1).











	2.


	    


	Meaning of Certain Terms


	. Except as otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used herein have the same meanings as in the Plan. The following terms have the following meanings:













	(a)






	“


	Beneficiary


	” means, in the event of the Participant’s death, the beneficiary named in the written designation (in form acceptable to the Administrator) most recently filed with the Administrator by the Participant prior to the Participant’s death and not subsequently revoked, or, if there is no such designated beneficiary, the executor or administrator of the Participant’s estate. An effective beneficiary designation will be treated as having been revoked only upon receipt by the Administrator, prior to the Participant’s death, of an instrument of revocation in form acceptable to the Administrator.













	-1-





















	(b)






	 “


	Option Holder


	” means the Participant or, if as of the relevant time the Stock Option has passed to a Beneficiary, the Beneficiary.







	3.


	    


	Vesting; Method of Exercise; Treatment of the Stock Option Upon Cessation of Employment


	.













	(a)






	Vesting


	. As used herein with respect to the Stock Option or any portion thereof, the term “vest” means to become exercisable and the term “vested” as applied to any outstanding Stock Option means that the Stock Option is then exercisable, subject in each case to the terms of the Plan. Unless earlier terminated, forfeited, relinquished or expired, and subject to subsection (b) below, the Stock Option shall become vested as to 25% of the total number of shares of Stock subject to the Stock Option on each of the first four anniversaries of the Grant Date, with the number of shares of Stock that vest on any such date being rounded down to the nearest whole share and the Award becoming fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the Grant Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares of Stock subject to the Stock Option shall not vest on any vesting date unless the Participant has remained in continuous Employment from the Grant Date through such vesting date.
















	(b)






	Change in Control


	. If (i) in connection with a Change in Control the Stock Option, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such Change in Control, is assumed or continued, or a new award is substituted for the Stock Option by the acquiror or survivor (or an affiliate of the acquiror or survivor) in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of the Plan, and (ii) at any time within the 18-month period following the Change in Control, the Participant’s Employment is terminated by the Company (or its successor) without Cause, the Stock Option (or the award substituted for the Stock Option), to the extent then outstanding but not then vested, will automatically vest in full at the time of such termination.







	If in connection with a Change in Control the Stock Option is not assumed or continued, or a new award is not substituted for the Stock Option by the acquiror or survivor (or an affiliate of the acquiror or survivor) in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of the Plan, the Stock Option, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such Change in Control but not then vested, will automatically vest in full upon the occurrence of such Change in Control.













	(c)






	Exercise of the Stock Option


	. No portion of the Stock Option may be exercised until such portion vests. Each election to exercise any vested portion of the Stock Option will be subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and shall be in writing, signed by the Option Holder (or in such other form as is acceptable to the Administrator). Each such written exercise election must be received by the Company at its principal office or by such other party as the Administrator may prescribe and be accompanied by payment in full as provided in the Plan. The exercise price may be paid (i) by cash or check acceptable to the Administrator, (ii) to the extent permitted by the Administrator, through a broker-assisted













	-2-












	cashless exercise program acceptable to the Administrator, (iii) by such other means, if any, as may be acceptable to the Administrator, or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing permissible forms of payment. In the event that the Stock Option is exercised by a person other than the Participant, the Company will be under no obligation to deliver shares of Stock hereunder unless and until it is satisfied as to the authority of the Option Holder to exercise the Stock Option and compliance with applicable securities laws. The latest date on which the Stock Option or any portion thereof may be exercised will be the 7th anniversary of the Grant Date (the “


	Final Exercise Date


	”). If the Stock Option is not exercised by the Final Exercise Date the Stock Option or any remaining portion thereof will thereupon immediately terminate.













	(d)






	Treatment of the Stock Option Upon Cessation of Employment


	. If the Participant’s Employment ceases, the Stock Option, to the extent not already vested will be immediately forfeited, and any vested portion of the Stock Option that is then outstanding will be treated as follows:







	(i)


	    


	Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii) below and Section 4 of this Agreement, the Stock Option, to the extent vested immediately prior to the cessation of the Participant’s Employment (after giving effect to any accelerated vesting as provided for herein), will remain exercisable until the earlier of (A) the date which is three months following the date of such cessation of Employment, or (B) the Final Exercise Date, and except to the extent previously exercised as permitted by this Section 3(d)(i) will thereupon immediately terminate.




	(ii)


	    


	Subject to clause (iii) below and Section 4 of this Agreement, the Stock Option, to the extent vested immediately prior to the cessation of the Participant’s Employment due to death, will remain exercisable until the earlier of (A) the first anniversary of the Participant’s death or (B) the Final Exercise Date, and except to the extent previously exercised as permitted by this Section 3(d)(ii) will thereupon immediately terminate.




	(iii)


	    


	If the Participant’s Employment is terminated by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with an act or failure to act constituting Cause (as the Administrator, in its sole discretion, may determine), or such termination occurs in circumstances that in the determination of the Administrator would have entitled the Company and its subsidiaries to terminate the Participant’s Employment for Cause, the Stock Option (whether or not vested) will immediately terminate and be forfeited upon such termination.




	4.


	    


	Forfeiture; Recovery of Compensation


	.










	-3-





















	(a)






	The Administrator may cancel, rescind, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict the Stock Option at any time if the Participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of this Agreement and the Plan.
















	(b)






	The Stock Option is subject to Section 6(a)(5) of the Plan. The Stock Option (whether or not vested or exercisable) is subject to forfeiture, termination and rescission, and the Participant will be obligated to return to the Company the value received with respect to the Stock Option (including shares of Stock delivered under the Stock Option, and any gain realized on a subsequent sale or disposition of shares), (i) in accordance with any Company clawback or other policy relating to the recovery of incentive compensation, as such policy may be amended and in effect from time to time, or (ii) as otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange listing standards, including, without limitation, Section 10D of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed as limiting the general application of Section 9 of this Agreement.







	5.


	    


	Transfer of Stock Option


	. The Stock Option may not be transferred except as expressly permitted under Section 6(a)(3) of the Plan.

	8.


	    


	Stock Ownership Guidelines

	”). Each PSU represents the conditional right to receive, without payment but subject to the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Agreement and in the Plan, one share of Stock, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 7 of the Plan in respect of transactions occurring after the date hereof. The percentage of the Target Award that may be earned by the Participant will be determined in accordance with

	(a)    If, prior to the Performance Period End Date (as defined in


	Exhibit A

The number of Earned PSUs, if any, shall continue to vest based solely on time and shall vest on the Vesting Date, subject to the Participant remaining in continuous Employment through such date, except as otherwise provided in Section 4(b) below.

	(ii)    If, in connection with a Change in Control described in subsection (a) above, the Earned PSUs are not assumed or continued, or a new award is not substituted for the Earned PSUs by the acquiror or survivor (or an affiliate of the acquiror or survivor) in accordance with the provisions of Section 7 of the Plan, the Earned PSUs will automatically vest in full upon the occurrence of such Change in Control.




	(c)    In the event a Change in Control occurs following a termination of Employment described in Section 3(b) above and prior to the Performance Period End Date, the PSUs shall become Earned PSUs as provided for in Section 4(a) above and will automatically vest in full upon the occurrence of such Change in Control.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Dunkin' Brands' First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Stacey Caravella, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thank you, Shannon, and good morning, everyone. Speaking on today's call will be Dunkin' Brands' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Nigel Travis; President of Dunkin' Donuts, U.S. and Canada, Dave Hoffmann; and Dunkin' Brands' Acting Chief Financial Officer, Kate Jaspon. We also have Chris Fuqua, Senior Vice President of Brand Marketing, Global Consumer Insights & Product Innovation for Dunkin' Donuts, and Scott Hudler, Chief Digital Officer, both of whom will be also available for Q&A.
Today's call is being webcast live and recorded for replay. Before I turn the call over to Nigel, I'd like to remind everyone that the language on forward-looking statements included in our earnings release also applies to our comments made during this call. Our release can be found on our website, investor.dunkinbrands.com, along with any reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP measures.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Nigel.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Stacey, thank you very much, and thanks to everyone for joining today's call to discuss our first quarter 2017 results. In the first quarter of 2017, we achieved mid-single digit operating income growth and double-digit earnings per share growth. I believe these results demonstrate the beauty and consistency of our asset-light, 100-percent franchised business model.
Our first quarter results were delivered in an increasingly challenging environment for retail and restaurants. But despite this, our franchisees continued to invest in our brands. In fact, over the past two years, they have invested more than $1 billion into growing their Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins businesses.
As it is small business week, I'd like to take a moment to thank our franchisees, many of whom are small business owners for their commitment to our brands. Their investment is also a testament to our ongoing focus on franchisee relationships and franchisee profitability.
Now back to our Q1 results. Yes, our flat Dunkin' Donuts U.S. comparable store sales were disappointing. Weather was about a 60 basis point headwind for us, as our core Northeast markets were hit hard in March. But that's not an excuse.
60 basis points of comp growth would have been disappointing as well. That said, we believe we have the right strategic plan in place for the future and our confidence is demonstrated by the fact that we are reconfirming our Dunkin' Donuts U.S. comparable store sales growth guidance.

You'll recall that our plan includes building our company culture, faster and improved product innovation, targeted value and smart pricing, being a leader in digital, improving the restaurant experience and driving consumer packaged goods and new channels.
We know our brand can deliver more growth, but as we've been saying all along, there will be quarterly ups and downs in our performance along the way.
Let me take a step back and address what's going on in the retail industry. The consumer is demanding higher-quality products more quickly and at lower prices, a phenomenon known as the Amazon effect. It's pushing grocery stores to lower food prices to compete and is resulting in a greater than three-point gap between food-at-home and food-away-from-home indices.
Additionally, while U.S. unemployment is extremely low, in fact less than 3% in some states, and with wage growth rising, inflation is rising more rapidly. Stronger inflation is translating into slightly lower real income, which means less disposable income and consumers are becoming more selective with how they spend those extra dollars. That means the brand differentiation is critical. A large part of this differentiation for Dunkin' will be using industry-leading digital technologies to deliver a more convenient experience for our guests.
The current marketplace also impacts us in another way. With low unemployment, it is harder to attract and retain quality labor, and the average labor turnover rate in our industry is greater than 150%. Yes, 150%. Long term, we believe that a low unemployment rate is good news for the economy. However, we are working closely with our franchisees to help strategically offset labor cost increases in the restaurants.
Here's how we do it. First, you'll recall that in February, we began a 300-store streamlined menu test. We believe that streamlined menu is making Dunkin' an easier place to work and that we believe will reduce turnover in the long term. I've personally visited two of the test markets and in my conversations with restaurant managers, they shared their enthusiasm for the simplified menu saying it is making training the crew much easier, improved morale and creating a better sense of teamwork. Secondly, we held a People Summit in Florida this past month for our franchises. It was dedicated to discussing best practices for recruiting, hiring, managing and motivating employees, as well as addressing the unique needs of a millennial crewmember. Nearly 800 franchisees and staff attended.
So, less turnover, a happier crew, simplified restaurant operations and great conversations with our franchisees about management practices should lead to a better guest experience. That's how it works. And a better guest experience is a critical element in our plan to distinguish ourselves in a highly competitive environment.
I mentioned earlier about the importance of utilizing technology, a key element of our six-part plan as a way to differentiate ourselves. Based on my feature (6:56) industry experience, I recognized when I joined the company back in 2009 that we needed one-to-one marketing and a treasure trove of data that comes with it.
This kicked off a series of strategic, pre-planned events. Let me take you back. Firstly is the rollout of an unified POS system in 2011, the introduction of our app in 2012, the launch of the Perks loyalty program three years later, and then last year, the rollout of On-the-Go mobile ordering. I believe our industry-leading digital platforms will continue to bolster our top-line sales for years to come. Dave will go into this topic in more detail later on.
During Q1, we also celebrated and we certainly did celebrate the successful launch of Dunkin' Donuts' ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee, which is being manufactured, distributed and sold by the Coca-Cola Company along with its bottling partners, and it's in grocery chains, gas, drug, and convenience stores nationally and in Dunkin' Donuts restaurants. In fact, Dunkin' Donuts ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee was named the best new product in January as part of a reader survey by the Beverage Industry Magazine.

Our entry into the RTD category means more people are drinking Dunkin' Donuts coffee every day. In fact, we estimate we will sell through the various channels nearly 5 trillion cups of coffee globally this year.
With that, I'll hand it over to Dave, who will cover the Dunkin' Donuts U.S. performance. Dave?
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thanks, Nigel, and good morning, everyone. When I came to Dunkin' after 20-plus years in the industry, I undertook an immersive training experience, which involved there months of working in our restaurants. And through this, I developed a true understanding of how our restaurant operations and the needs of our franchisees, their employees, and of course, our guests. It's an experience that will guide the decisions that I make and help me better support our franchisees and the brand going forward.
So now, on to the first quarter. Our systemwide sales grew nearly 5% in the U.S., primarily through new store growth. Comparable store sales were flat, as ticket growth was offset by traffic declines. Ticket growth was approximately 3%. Inclusive in ticket growth was less discounting year-over-year and a slightly positive mix shift. Strategic price continue to be in the 200 basis point range.
From a category standpoint, breakfast sandwich sales were strong driven by value messaging. Iced coffee sales were also up riding on the Cold Brew platform.
Now looking forward, we are excited about our Fruited Iced Teas, which are available nationwide today, as well as our unique Dunkin' Energy Punch powered by Monster Energy, currently being offered across the Northeast and Miami.
Dunkin' Punch is an innovation that came directly from our franchisees and crew that we believe will especially appeal to our millennial customers. We're also thrilled about the launch of our new frozen coffee. It's the magic of our best-in-class iced coffee but now frozen. It's an amazing product.
So, to kick of the launch, we are hosting our first-ever national tasting event on Friday, May 19 from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM where we'll be providing free samples of frozen Dunkin' coffee to all of our guests. And of course, we will always post a national value messaging throughout the year in both traditional and digital channels.
As Nigel mentioned, our efforts in the digital space are critical to differentiate ourselves from the competition. We now have 6.5 million Perks members, and during the first quarter, DD Perks represented greater than 10% of Dunkin' U.S. sales, while On-the-Go ordering grew to nearly 2% of transactions.
At the end of March, we announced the partnership with Waze, the real-time, crowd-sourced traffic and navigation app. Dunkin' became the first partner for Waze's new feature order ahead, which lets Wazers skip a line by submitting orders in advance through the Dunkin' mobile app.
We also participated in a highly successful T-Mobile Tuesdays promotion, designed to drive transactions and Perks enrollment where T-Mobile users were eligible to claim a free virtual Dunkin' card. These strategic partnerships along with our delivery and catering test with DoorDash demonstrate our continued focus on broadening our accessibility and convenience.
Now, let me move to restaurant development in Q1. In the first quarter, Dunkin' U.S. franchisees opened 56 net new restaurants versus 69 net new units last year. Our franchisees also completed 81 remodels during the quarter. Dunkin' has a unique combination in the retail and restaurant space of a strong heritage and tremendous long-term growth. We ended 2011, the year we went public, with just shy of 130 restaurants in the West region and very few territorial development agreements in place.
Today, we finished Q1 of this year with development agreements now in place in many key markets across the region and more than 450 locations. We believe that long-term, we can have 5,000 sites in the region and let me remind you that when we say West, we mean the entire region, West of the Mississippi. Obviously, the key to smart development is franchisee profitability. If our franchisees are profitable, they will build more restaurants, it's as simple as that and of course that fuels Dunkin' Brands' earnings growth.

Also critical to store development is a strong franchisor-franchisee relationship, built on trust and mutual respect. And I could tell you, during Nigel's eight-plus years at Dunkin', I know he's spent a significant amount of time building solid relationships with our franchisees. These relationships, along with responsible growth are top priorities for me as well.
Strategic partnerships are just as important as new growth in increasing our brand presence. So in April, we were proud to announce that Dunkin' hot coffee is now available on board Amtrak, Acela Express high-speed trains throughout the Northeast Corridor. With the new agreement, our hot coffee is now available to the 3.4 million customers, who ride Acela Express trains each year. Going forward, we are obviously excited to build on our new partnership with Amtrak.
Since coming on board I've been asked several times and by many folks, how hard can it possibly be to run a Dunkin' restaurant? And the answer is, well, pretty difficult. What makes us unique in our industry is that we literally customize and personalize every order. A great example of this is our core product hot coffee. There are literally thousands of different ways you can order it. Now it's imperative, especially in this highly competitive market that we serve our customers their coffee exactly as they ordered it. But if my time training in the restaurant showed me anything, it was how difficult it is to get the basics fast, accurate and friendly right with our complex menu.
As Nigel referenced earlier, the new streamlined menu is being well received by restaurant managers and crew and we will be rolling it out to the 800 additional restaurants later this year. Again, obviously, menu simplification does involve the elimination of some of our slower moving products. That's why we are taking our time to test the impact of this SKU rationalization, and we believe the benefits in the long run will help drive top-line sales and improve restaurant-level margin. This will continue to be a cultural mindset for our organization as menu simplification broadens into overall restaurant simplification.
Collectively as a system, we're on journey, a journey to continue to move up the consumer experiential curve and distance ourselves from the competitors that are commoditizing their offering. Our consumer research last summer showed that guests want to use Dunkin' as a place to take five minutes, not 50 minutes. And as we jokingly say around here, there are other coffee houses where you can go to write your screenplay. That's just not us. It's not who our customers want us to be. Our goal is to be the most beloved beverage-led to-go brand in the country.
It's about ensuring that the Dunkin' experience is not one that can be replicated elsewhere. We want to be a place of positive transition in peoples' lives, whether it's from home to the office, from dropping the kids at school to hitting the gym, there are endless transitions that people go through every day, and we want to be the brand that people turn to, to help set the tone for their day.
We are using the consumer insights we gained last year from our deep-dive study with thousands of customers and the starting point for our new restaurant design, including the drive-thru. More than half of our restaurants included drive-thru, and with our customers need for a fast transaction, improving our drive-thrus with new designs and technologies offers us a significant competitive advantage and a real opportunity to optimize how we will serve not only today's guests, but future guests as well.
So, in closing, look, we know that we need to get transactions moving in the right direction. That's why we are executing against our six-part plan. We believe it gives us the right balance of driving traffic through beverages and ticket through food attachment. Menu simplification will continue to play a key role in unlocking improved operations, a better customer experience and increased franchisee profitability, giving Dunkin' Brands and our franchisees the ability to continue to invest back into the business around menu innovation, digital technologies and convenience.

So, let me stop there, and I'll turn it back over to Nigel to take your through our Baskin-Robbins U.S. and international results. Nigel?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thanks, Dave. Baskin-Robbins U.S. comparable store sales were negative during the first quarter, driven by decline in traffic offset by increased average ticket. As I mentioned earlier, the Dunkin' Donuts U.S., we are undertaking digital technology initiatives with Baskin U.S., including rolling out a new mobile app, which has had more than 500,000 downloads since it launched last year and testing delivery. We look forward now to rolling out our home delivery test to more markets in the near term.
Moving on to international; there is tremendous instability in many parts of the world right now, and it continues to weigh on both of our brands overseas. We know international needs to perform better, and the team is highly engaged in making that happen. We have a plan to stabilize the business with focus on our top-priority markets. We're driving initiatives to improve the customer experience, expand convenience, and increase transactions. A good example is Saudi Arabia, where Baskin-Robbins expanded its delivery program and now includes more than 30 delivery hubs.
On the mobile side, the Dunkin' Donuts app in Germany has had nearly 100,000 downloads since it launched just shy of a year ago. And during the quarter, we opened Dunkin' Donuts in the Netherlands. That's a great experience if you go there.
Before I hand it over to Kate to cover our financials, I'd like to say that I'm proud of and energized by how the organization has handled our recent leadership changes. It's a credit to our succession planning process, which I believe is one of our core organizational strengths.
So, over to Kate.
Kate Jaspon - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thanks, Nigel. The growth in revenue for the first quarter was primarily due to increased royalty income, resulting from our systemwide sales growth. Rental income also contributed to revenue growth, and the sale of our company-owned restaurants resulted in us having approximately 30 more leases in our real estate portfolio, which we now collect rent on. These increases were offset by no longer having sales from company-owned restaurants.
In Q1 2016, we owned 41 points of distribution, which contributed $5.7 million in revenue. Operating income and adjusted operating income growth was driven by the increase in royalty income, as G&A expenses remained flat year-over-year. Q1 last year was also unfavorably impacted by the net operating results of the company-owned restaurants.
The increase in net income and adjusted net income for the first quarter was primarily the net result of the increase in operating income, as well as a decrease in income tax expense. The decrease in tax expense was driven by $6.1 million of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, which are now included in our P&L and our effective tax rate as a result of the required adoption of a new accounting standard.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 29.1%, including approximately 900 basis points of impact from this new standard. Diluted earnings per share and diluted adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter increased by 27.5% to $0.51 and 22.7% to $0.54 respectively.
The increase in our shares outstanding was due to the exercise of stock options and the new accounting standard, offset by the repurchase of shares since the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of excess tax benefits, earnings per share would have been $0.06 lower. At the end of the first quarter, we had a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.6:1.
During the quarter, we generated approximately $36.2 million in free cash flow. We ended the quarter with close to $400 million in cash and short-term restricted cash on the balance sheet. Of that, $130 million represents cash associated with our gift card programs and our marketing fund balances. We used $30 million in cash during the quarter to pay our Q1 cash dividend to shareholders.

As you may have noticed, we increased our full-year earnings per share guidance to reflect the approximately $0.06 tax benefit we recognized during the first quarter due to the new accounting standards. We've also revised our full-year effective tax rate to 36.5% to include the impacts of the excess tax benefit recognized in Q1. This benefit reduced our full-year effective tax rate by approximately 200 basis points.
Our guidance excludes any potential future material impact as a result of the new accounting standards. We are proud to have returned nearly $1.8 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases and our quarterly dividend programs since going public in July of 2011. I'd like to take this opportunity to address our share repurchase philosophy.
We tend to think about repurchases holistically for the year rather than on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Several factors go into our decision on share repurchases, so while we ended Q1 with a sizeable cash balance available to us, especially given our asset-light model. It does not signal any change in our commitment to returning value to our shareholders.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Stacey to begin the Q&A session.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thanks, Kate. Shannon, we're ready for the Q&A session.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from John Glass with Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
John Glass - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks very much. Kate, can I ask maybe just couple of questions on your role of value. You talked about the consumer being more value-sensitive. So, as you've gotten into the brand and looked at it and come from a major competitor, that's obviously focused historically on value, how do you see changes necessary on the value side of the business?
And when you look at your first quarter results, is there a way to see – are you losing your most value-sensitive customers, for example, smaller coffees, for example. Is there a way to parse results to indicate that in fact that's what's happening? Or is it a broader based decline in traffic across all price points, let's say?
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. Thanks, John. Hey, look, Chris and I will tag team on this one. But value is going to continue to be core to who we are as a brand. Coming out of Q1, learnings are – value is going to take on more prominence going forward and as I mentioned, you're going to see us pulse in national offers at a greater rate throughout the year. But in addition to that, digital is going to continue to evolve as the key platform for us on everyday value, in addition to being a recruiting tool as well.
But just taking a step back on your point about what we're seeing out of hot coffee. I mean for us, we wouldn't differentiate ourselves from coffee commodity players and our value equation is also about our great quality, from the bean to grind fresh, brew fresh every time. That's the campaign that we're driving out there as well. So, we know we have to – it's a competitive environment, we're going to continue to dial-up the value as we go forward. That was one of the key learnings coming out of Q1. But we're bullish on what we've got for the remainder of the year.
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Yeah. And thanks for the question, John. We think about this, we think about the price value experience equation. We think we have pricing in a much better place with some proprietary tools we put in place. We're talking with our franchisees on pricing on a much more regular basis. I think we have a value strategy that is locked in, sold in and ready to go for the balance of the year. We've learned a lot in Q1. And our six-point plan, one of the key components, is focusing on that restaurant experience. So that when a guest comes into our restaurant, they experience the best of all three parts of the equation.

Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So, let me just add a little bit there. I mean, obviously, we've added a few changes in the last few quarters, but one thing that Dave's really added to our organization is a bite (26:02) on value. And I think he's come with a credibility of what happened to his previous employer. And I think it helps us communicate much more effectively with our franchisees the benefit of value marketing. So, I think that's true added value from what we had previously.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.

Our next question comes from John Ivankoe with JPMorgan. You may begin.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hi. Thank you. Not to put words in your mouth, but listening to what you're talking about today, still, expansion of the simplified menu, 300 stores adding an additional 800 stores by year-end, labor cost, labor availability, which is very clearly tightening, listening to your prepared remarks, Nigel, and negative same-store traffic and perhaps an increased need for value.
All those things together, again, just looking from the outside looking in, suggest that franchisees might slow down their development. In other words, 2017 might not have been the down year of development that we may have some more to go with some of the underpinnings of the brand and underpinnings of profitability get worked out. So, I just wanted to use this format and venue to just give us your sense of what that very important piece to the business model is in terms of future franchising and development in the U.S.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So, John, yeah, a complicated question and I think I've got it. So, let me comment on that. I mean, there is no doubt the environment is more competitive, as you pointed out and I pointed out earlier, in terms of, let's say, the pressure on the marketplace on the consumer being more selective. So, that's one.
Secondly is the fact that labor is tighter. If you ask all our franchisees what their number one issue is they will say it's finding good labor. But it isn't just our sector. There was recently a Boston Global article that talked about the lack of cooks in Boston. So, it's affecting the whole industry. It's affecting also industries like the construction industry.
So, one of the things that I think needs to be tackled and this is really an administration issue is how to increase the labor pool. There's all kinds of ways of doing it. There's all kinds of proposals on how to go through it today, but we need to increase the labor pool because it is getting tight out there and I think it's going to have an impact not only on us but others because people just can't get labor. I think we're being incredibly proactive.
And besides helping our franchisees find a way of retaining people, which is the best way of tackling labor turnover, we're also finding ways to reduce their cost. We've got a very proactive approach working through cost reductions at the DCP, energy savings, and the streamlined menu test. We'll also, I think, find ways of taking some labor out through things like having less time spent on things like inventory.
So, coming back to how all that fits together. I think our franchisees are very confident. As we said, they have invested in these both brands over $1 billion over the last couple of years. I think they've got great confidence in what Dave is doing. We continue to be a development machine. I haven't gotten all the numbers at hand, but when I compare our development for the first quarter against everyone else's, apart from Starbucks, I would suggest that we may have opened more stores in the first quarter than just about anyone else over the whole year. So, again, we remain a development machine. Obviously, it's a top logistical exercise to manage all this development, but we're on top of it. But the core is unit economics, the core is getting the right labor, and we're totally focused on tackling those issues.

John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC
And of all the factors that we've discussed, Nigel, I'll ask the question in a slightly different way. Doesn't it make sense that the rate of development in the U.S. slowed down from where we are? In other words, should you be growing as quickly as you are given some of the external and internal challenges that your business are facing?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
We'll, we've guided 385. We've retained that guidance. I know, John, you have a thesis that we've discussed many times, and I always love your challenges because they always lead to great animated debates, but we feel that we've got the right plan to deliver our goals. We continue to stay focus on that. And I suspect you'd love us to come down to about 320 and feel comfortable with it, but we've got to stretch all the development we can get.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thanks, John.
John William Ivankoe - JPMorgan Securities LLC

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Bernstein with Barclays. You may begin.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Great. Thank you very much. Maybe just two-part question on comps and the components within it. One, I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the trends you saw in the first quarter and how that relates to your full year guidance which, again, does assume an uptick but yet the compares are relatively stable. So, the first question is just, whether you're assuming a macro uptick for the rest of the year or maybe you have some internal product or initiative that you think are going to accelerate trends?
And then the second related part was just on the pricing. I think Dave you mentioned that pricing is currently running in that 2% range. I was wondering whether there's any color from franchisees or what's your learning in those discussions in terms of whether there's intent to ease pricing further in 2017 and whether perhaps that happens naturally through the more aggressive value that you're talking about? Thanks.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Jeff. Thanks a lot. I'm going to pass that straight over to Dave and Chris.
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yes. Thanks, Jeff. In terms of Q1 learnings in the calendar year, of course, it's a competitive environment. As you've heard from us, we're not coming off guidance of low-single-digit growth for the year. The thing I'd say to you is we're obviously more than a one quarter company. We're executing against our plan to transition as a beverage-led, On-the-Go brand but very much as you've heard me talk about value, very much steeped in value, convenience, and accessibility. And I'll let Chris elaborate on this a little bit more.
But just to your point on pricing, again, the contribution was 200 basis points for the quarter. Again, we're working with our franchisees with pricing workshops out there using our proprietary pricing tool that we developed with APT. Of course, we triangulate this always with CPI, food-away-from-home, food-at-home, et cetera. But, it's going to be a lever for us but it's not our only lever as we look at productivity improvements up and down the P&L. So, there's many there but this is a lever, but it's not our only one that we're pulling.
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Yeah. And then, Dave, I would add, I think if you look at, at what we're trying to do over the long-term, we're in the second inning of implementing a new strategy. We think about our six-part strategy, it's something that's going to drive long-term comp growth, long-term revenue growth. If we look at the quarter, our two-year stack was a little bit better than Q4. We're reiterating our low-single-digit guidance on comps for the balance of the year.

And then on pricing, this pricing optimization tool helps us do a few things. It helps us look at a store-by-store basis. There are stores that shouldn't touch price at all because of certain components. There are others that have opportunities in some categories, but not others. And I would say, we're getting much more granular on the discussion around pricing with our franchisees than we have in the past. And like Dave said, it's a lever, but it's not the only lever.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So, Chris, let me just ask you a question, follow up on that. So, how receptive are the franchisees in your mind to this new pricing tool?
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
They're asking for meetings, they're asking for more engagement on a regular basis. So, we've had a pretty good relationship in this area in the past, we have an even better one today. We're adding resources on pricing. We have people out in the markets talking about this, but a number of other things on a regular basis.
Jeffrey Bernstein - Barclays Capital, Inc.
And any color on the sequential trend through the quarter? Or those in the quarter?
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
I think in keeping with our historic practices, we're not going to give sequential trends.

Our next question comes from Nicole Miller with Piper Jaffray. You may begin.
Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray
Thanks. Good morning.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Hi.
Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray
Looking back at the meeting you talked about with 800 franchise and staff members, what did you hear from them? What did they like or not like? And what kind of suggestions did they make? Thanks.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Sorry, you came out with (35:19). You talked about the 800...?
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
The People Summit.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Oh, the People Summit.
Nicole Miller Regan - Piper Jaffray
Yes. Yes.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay, all right. So, well, firstly, I wasn't there for the whole time. So, Rich Emmett, who's sitting in the room, was, so I'll ask him to comment in a second. But the first message, Nicole, was, as I've said, everyone is concerned about labor. I mean, that's why we have 800 people turn up. I mean, they are concerned about finding the right people. They're concerned about how to pay the people. They're concerned about what kind of culture. And I think it is something – this might not sound spectacular to some of you on the phone who work for big companies, but we have, as I've said in my remarks, lots of small businesspeople.
And words like culture are kind of a new thing. And culture isn't something you just pull off the wall and stick it in. It's something you have to build. And one of the benefits of being in a 100% franchise system is that you actually have a bunch of different cultures, and that gives, in my view, the unique characteristics of Dunkin' is that it has a personalization at every store. And I'm always amazed when I go and talk to journalists. They always talk about their individual experience at different stores. So, they have to build the culture to keep people in their organization.
So, I think they focus very much on what kind of compensation strategies they need, what kinds of payment structures, how they recruit people. But, Rich, you were there the whole time.
Richard J. Emmett - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. Hi, Nicole. Yeah. Nigel, you covered most of it. Various franchisees have various needs. Some need to start with recruiting, how do we recruit the type of employee that we want to come in, in the door? There are others that have recruiting figured out. They want to learn more about how to onboard those that they've recruited. There are others that listen to other franchisees through best practice seminars in terms of what are best practices in terms of pay in terms of retention which is very, very important. If you had a good employee, you certainly want to keep him. It's a lot easier to keep a good employee than to hire a new one.

And that plays right into one of the main themes of what Nigel just talked about and that is developing a culture within your respective franchise organization because it's the culture that plays a very key role, certainly, pay is important, everything else is important. But if you can develop the untenable thing known as culture, you will be the employer of choice and be that company or franchisee that people want to come to and that people want to continue to work for.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. I just want to talk about one thing because your question brings this to mind. We talked about 150%. That is an industry number. That is not our number. And we have some franchisees down there who have created such a great culture because they have no turnover. I mean, I'm often shocked when I find out everyone has been there for like 10, 12 years.

Our next question comes from David Tarantino with Baird. You may begin.
David E. Tarantino - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Hi. Good morning. Dave, my question's for you about this simplification initiative. First, if you could maybe comment on what you're seeing so far in terms of sales and margins? And then maybe a broader follow-up to that would be, can you talk about what your vision is in terms of margin improvement related to simplification? Is it tens of basis points, hundreds of basis points?
And then maybe on a related question about the ROIC for franchisees, is there any opportunity to also improve the development cost side of the equation?
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
David, yeah, thanks for the question, and you're going to be underfed on the answer unfortunately, I'm not going to – we're not going to get into it but you can interpret that everything is very much in line with expectations with the idea that we're going to take this to another 800 locations going forward. We want to be very fiduciary in our thinking and making sure that we really understand going from the current 270 to 800, we understand the impact.
But look, it's obvious, de-cluttering the restaurant, taking out slow moving SKUs makes it easier for the crew, it makes it better for the customer. And we're seeing a lot of improvements on the P&L. There is great velocity on the P&L up and down, but it's still early.
But the other part of this is simplification is also all about creating room for growth, so that we can invest in new innovations in menu and digital as well as investments in value going forward as well. So, again, let us get a few more markets on the board before we telegraph a lot of that, but you can certainly interpret the expansion as everything is in line with expectations.

Our next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. You may begin.
David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up to David's question. Could you just give specifics about perhaps what you're trying to solve with the menu rationalization, is it largely around speed and throughput, and is it about the margins that are going to offset to labor pressures. And then perhaps, relatedly, beverage focus makes a lot of sense, but how are you rethinking the role of future – in the future of food, and what role can that be in your growth and how much is that perhaps gone too far in one direction that's maybe hurt you lately? Thanks.
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
David, thanks for the question. This is Chris. So, our research last year showed us that we weren't really known as a food or a beverage player. So, the whole idea behind our strategy is to be the most-loved On-the-Go beverages brand. We want to drive speed and throughput with menu simplification with a focus on really getting those best-in-class beverages out there. We want to drive profits for our franchisees. We want to address some of the labor challenges that Nigel has talked about, reducing turnover because Dunkin' will be a better place to work.

We think it cleans up the restaurants. We think it leads to improved margins on food cost. We think it leads to fewer throwaways, better waste management. It leads to easier unloading of trucks in the stores as an example. There are a lot of benefits that will show up in various parts of the P&L. And we think this is one of the major unlocks to getting this strategy that we've talked about recently, really going in the right direction.

Our next question comes from Karen Holthouse with Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Hi. Just a quick modeling question. I was a little bit surprised to see other revenue down year-over-year in the quarter. You still – looks like you've been seeing retail sales growth on the packaged coffee side, on the K-Cups side, would have expected to start to see a benefit from ready-to-drink. Maybe just help us out with whatever moving pieces could be heading that line?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. So, let me just kick off and then I'm going to get Kate to do the more detailed answer. This is always an interesting area for us. And clearly, all of you have different assumptions. I think one thing I will say, because I think it's important for me to say, is, as I've said in my prepared comments, we're delighted with the start of RTD, but it's not like instantly on. If we go into a restaurant with a new product, it's instantly on. If you launch into with RTD, it takes time to go through the system, because each brand has its own reset of its organization on where the products go. So, you're facing may not be the reality that we see. And because we're a relatively new company to consumer products, clearly some of that is new to us as well.
So, with that said, we're delighted with RTD. We're delighted with what we're doing on K-Cups, and Kate will take you through the detail.
Kate Jaspon - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Great. Thanks, Nigel. I think the other thing I wanted to remind everybody on is the other revenue line item. While it does include all of the packaged cup, the K-Cups, and RTD, it also includes other items and we are rolling over a sizable transfer that was included in the first quarter of 2016.
So, excluding this, to Nigel's point, RTD, which we rolled out with Coke, rolled out mid-February of this quarter, so just about half of the quarter and, to Nigel's point, is gaining in distribution but we're happy with that. And K-Cups volume has gone up. So, I think if you factor all three of those together, that gives us the bridge between the consensus number and what we've reported.
Karen Holthouse - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you.

Hey, guys. Can I go back to John's question on store development? I think the last cash-on-cash return number you've given us for West and Emerging was just over 19%. Is that the right metric that we should be thinking about or is it – maybe could you provide us with an update on that number?
Kate Jaspon - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So, we typically provide the update on the third quarter of our fiscal year, so we're not ready yet to update that because of the results coming in on a lag. But the information we gave is still...
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America
Right. And we expect the 2015 cohort to be in that 18% to 20% range. And to Kate's earlier point, we'll discuss that later in the year.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America
Got it. Thanks. And then just, Scott, can you talk about franchisee operations? And maybe what's changed operationally with mobile ordering? And do franchisees add labor, do they reduce labor, do they rearrange labor? And how was adoption looked in some urban markets versus suburban markets?

Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. So, just make sure – we often have Scott Murphy on this call and he's not here, so it's Scott Hudler today who's going to talk about the operational side and digital together.
Scott Hudler - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yeah. So, thanks for the question. I think we're seeing a lot of really positive energy coming from franchisees around On-the-Go ordering. What they're seeing is, at this point, they're deploying labor in a different way and making and delivering a better guest experience for people that are coming in because they don't have to stand in line. And we know that roughly 30% to 40% of the transaction time, it's just the ordering, the back and forth with the crew person running the register, so as we've eliminated that part of the transaction, we get people in and out faster and we can help to drive more throughput.
To your suburban, urban question, we're definitely seeing this as a strong driver in some of our more urban locations, so think Manhattan, Downtown Boston, some of our bigger markets, that we're definitely seeing strong results from those. But also from suburban locations that are near an entry point to a major highway, so think Long Island. We're seeing some of our best results from those locations.
Gregory R. Francfort - Bank of America
Awesome. Thanks, guys.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.

Our next question comes from Will Slabaugh with Stephens Inc. You may begin.
William E. Slabaugh - Stephens Inc.
Yeah. Thank you. Wonder if you could talk a little bit more about your first focal point you mentioned at the beginning of your talk where you re-highlighted the building a coffee culture. Can you talk about where you think you are today versus where you want to be from a standpoint of offerings and then also perception by the consumer? And also on the back of that, is it fair to think about this coffee evolution as you sort of going through as the most important point in driving more consistently positive comps, or am I downplaying something else there?
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
So, that's a great question, and I think there's a reason that it's the first component of our six-part strategy. Building our coffee culture really gets at the core of what we want this brand to be like going forward. We look at everything from revised advertising with campaigns, like, This is Coffee, which gets people to really understand that we're grinding fresh, we're brewing fresh, we're doing something different than anybody else in the industry.
And consumers, when they really dive into that, realized that it's different and we think it's better. We have focused operationally; think about that one of the other components of our strategy is to improve restaurant operations. We had our entire ops team visit all 8,500 plus locations in the month of March to go out and look at every single component of what goes into making a great cup of coffee, working with our crew, working with our franchisees on really delivering best-in-class products.
So, if you think about all the things we're doing on hot coffee, that's one component of building the coffee culture. Then, you move into specialty coffee, iced coffee, cold brew, the expansion of RTD, what we're doing in the CPG, on K-Cups, and packaged coffee. This is all about becoming a major player in the coffee industry in an even bigger way that we are today. And we look at product innovation. We look at some of the value offerings. We look at the underlying components of the loyalty program, everything focused on driving against the coffee culture and building growth going forward. That's the thesis.
David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
And, Will, it's Dave. The other piece for me coming in after spending 20-plus years in the industry, and the soul of Dunkin' is just that great quality cup of coffee. And I think it was surprising to me when I got here, the quality of the bean that we used grind fresh, brew fresh, every pod, 18-minute hold time, these are industry-leading that I don't think can be matched. So, we probably haven't shouted that enough. And as Chris mentioned, they put a brilliant campaign together called This Is Coffee, and it's out there running right now that really speaks to our attributes and separates us from a quality cup of coffee versus the commodity players that are out there.

Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thanks, Will.

Our next question comes from Jason West with Credit Suisse. You may begin.
Jason West - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Yeah. Thanks. A couple – one quick one and another question. So, are you guys providing the store counts openings by region anymore? And then secondly, looking at that net discounting which is adding another 200 basis points or so to the pricing; is that going to start rolling off? I think we're lapping the change in the combos from early last year. I don't know if that's affecting that still or as you're trying to become more focused on value in this competitive environment, it seems a bit counter-intuitive to have such a big increase in your net discounting. Thanks.
Kate Jaspon - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yes, so, I'll take the first piece, Jason. We aren't on a quarterly basis anymore. We're going to do that more on a full year basis. So, you can expect towards the end of the year, we'll give you. It's just noise on the quarter. So, we prefer to wait till the end of the year to give it to you on a full year basis.
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Yes. And then the question on net discounting, as it applies, I think you'd take it back to a couple of questions ago where we were talking about the value, price and experience equation. We look at more national price points on value with one of the things that Dave's brought for certain is focusing the entire system on offers instead of having desperate offers by market. So, that's number one.
Number two, the continued expansion of the Perks program, that's really our value program in the future. We'd like to migrate towards that. And number three, driving traffic with beverages and ticket with food. So, I think you'll see the offerings that we put out there will be aligned with that strategy, and we're very confident in the way our franchisees are going to execute it.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thanks, Jason.

Our next question comes from Matthew DiFrisco with Guggenheim. You may begin.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Thank you. Just a couple of quick bookkeeping ones. So, I just wanted to hear that, did you say that 10% of sales were done or are associated with the Perks members? And then also, would it be correct to assume in the less discounting world that the margins, why wouldn't those margins of the cohorts, why won't that go up more, that 18% to 20% or so? Shouldn't that get stronger?
And then last question, same-store sales, any correlation with RTD being introduced? Did that cannibalize any of your store-level sales throughout the quarter? Thanks.
Scott Hudler - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. Hey, this is Scott Hudler. I'll take the first one. Yes, 10% of sales in the quarter were through Perks transactions. And sitting here listening to all the questions, we probably didn't say what a good quarter we felt we had on Perks. And that's the trend that we intend to continue going forward. Major part of the strategy as Chris just said.
Moving on to your second question about cash-on-cash returns. And the margins we continue to focus on improving the margins. I think we're getting better in understanding by city, by DMA, particularly in newer markets and everyone's all over that. You guys should probably take some credit for making (52:49) this. So focused on that.
And finally, on RTD, we feel good about what's happened with RTD. We've never believed it will be cannibalistic at all. We believe it's additive and actually a major part of our coffee strategy. And, Chris, you're going to say something about...
Chris Fuqua - Dunkin' Donuts LLC
Yes. So, then I look at the growth of Cold Brew and the growth of iced coffee in our restaurants and it's one of the real highlights for what we look at. So, I think it's a complementary strategy and we're excited about it.

David L. Hoffmann - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yes, and, Matthew, just coming back to the cash-on-cash equation, again, any good operator and franchisor continues to look at the denominator side as well. So that coming in here fresh, we see opportunities on the cost side, they're taking cost – cost avoidance, things in the site work, the size of the footprint. There's a lot of great opportunities in there as well. So, it's multifaceted, but rich opportunities in that area as well.
Matthew DiFrisco - Guggenheim Securities LLC
Thank you.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.

Our next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. You may begin.
Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC
Great. Thank you. Just following up on the DD Perks question and the commentary there, I saw the performance during the quarter, but just wondering if you could talk a bit more about the opportunities to grow that both by increasing members and then increasing the spend. Maybe if you could just first talk about continuing to bring customers into that ecosystem, and then maybe what inning we're in as it relates to the direct marketing, the suggestive selling and how much more you think you could get out of the Perks numbers? Thank you.
Scott Hudler - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yes, Dennis, this is Scott. So, I think, like Nigel said, we're really encouraged about what we saw in Q1. This is the ability to reach out to our customers on a one-to-one basis, it's becoming increasingly more important as we see traditional kind of analog media, the effect in those channels starts to decline, so to be able to reach out to 6.5 million customers directly, it's a huge benefit for us. Also, as we think about targeted and value discounting, and Chris mentioned that we want Perks to evolve to the way we discount through the brand and that doesn't become from a more traditional kind of shotgun approach where we have necessarily offers that are open to everyone, but they were being very surgical with offers that each individual consumer gets an offer that will drive increased visitation and spend to them versus just being part of a demo or a – even drilling down more, we want them to be a very individualized offer.
So, to do that, we want to drive more people into the top of the funnel, and we think doing that with some of the things we've done recently with showing consumers that there is an opportunity to save some money through the Perks program with some of the price promotions we've run exclusive to Perks members in the first quarter of the year, as well as things like Dave mentioned T-Mobile Tuesdays, which is an opportunity to partner with someone else, a large partner like T-Mobile, to come in and drive incremental members to the Perks program.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Thanks, Dennis.
Dennis Geiger - UBS Securities LLC
Okay.
Stacey Caravella - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Operator, we're going to take two more questions, because we're getting close to the top of the hour.

Our next question is from Andrew Strelzik with BMO. You may begin.
Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had two things that I wanted to ask. Number one, understanding that you look at share repurchases more holistically, not on a quarterly basis, it has been five or six quarters now since we've seen really any meaningful buyback. So, I'm just wondering, within the context of that holistic view, how you're thinking about or kind of what the hesitancy to buy back stock has been?
And number two, when 2% of orders On-the-Go, not a huge percentage but a large absolute number, just wondering what you see from behavioral perspective when someone gets into the program starts doing the On-the-Go ordering from a frequency or check perspective, any type of behavioral commentary will be helpful. Thank you.

Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. So, then, in reverse order, as Scott was just talking, I'll let him finish off talking about On-the-Go. And then we'll go to share repurchases.
Scott Hudler - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Yes. So, yes, 2%, obviously we want that number to continue to grow. We're pleased with what we see on a weekly basis, from a growth perspective, that we've had a number of things to get people to knock down the barriers, so whether that's in Philly, a $0.50 hot or iced coffee, when you use On-the-Go to get people to try out. Once we get people to try out, we see incredibly high retrial rates of people coming back and using it. And we're continuing to see that repeat visit and we think as Dave talked about value and convenience, having someone order through On-the-Go and to be able to see past the line in store, it's a huge convenient play.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So, it's interesting. When I was in one of the test markets, the store manager told me that they have a couple of customers, who come in three or four times a day and the reason they can is On-the-Go ordering because they order the same thing for, I don't know what it was, let's say, a big iced coffee which is what Scott drinks. I don't know, you have iced tea, right?
Scott Hudler - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Iced tea.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Iced tea. And he's sitting here right now. So, he orders it or they order it, and for them to come in, not have to line up and just pick it up is the ultimate in convenience for them. It saves so much time. So, we are really excited about what's happening with this.
Kate, share repurchases.
Kate Jaspon - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Sure. Yes, thanks for the question, Andrew. So as I mentioned on the call, we think about share repurchases holistically. I don't think that you should take the fact that whether we're in the market or not in the market during a given quarter as a signal to anything. Several factors that go into our decision around whether we repurchase stock and all those you include price is not the only factor we consider. So, we're always thinking about taking all the potential cash needs for the business, timing and our trading windows, just as an example.
So, as I mentioned, even though we ended the quarter with a sizable cash balance and didn't repurchase during the quarter, that doesn't mean that we are running away from our current commitment to returning value to our shareholders.
Andrew Strelzik - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is from Steve Anderson with Maxim Group. You may begin.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group LLC
Yes. Good morning. I'm calling to ask about your unit growth strategy and specifically in your partnerships with sort of retails including that BJ's. And so I just wanted to see how that relationship has been ongoing? Have you seen any cannibalization with any other stores nearby?
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
So, I'll take that. So, I think if you look forward, as Dave mentioned in his remarks, you're going to see us expanding our brand in a sensible way across the country. I think the Amtrak deal is a good example. Another one that we did years ago but I think it's a good example of what we're trying to do in terms of building the brand is JetBlue which we're very pleased with particularly as they keep growing very quickly.
BJ's was a relationship that we are very happy with. It's actually our franchisees that run the stores. It's franchisee growth. It's not if you like direct cannibalization of the new franchisee on them. So, we feel good about that. And I think the opportunity for April growth is staggering. I mean here's a specific that came from one of our original quote.

In Texas, there are 900 colleges and universities. We're in one. I mean that tells you the opportunity. Look at the airports around the country and I can't remember the actual number, but I think it's – we're in sort of 120 airports. Don't take that as the right number. It's something like that but there's a lot more airports we can go in and I look at the success of places by LAX Airport where we're doing staggering numbers. I look at workplaces. We went into the Chrysler building in Detroit and that's been off the charts in terms of success even though it's got three of the Starbucks around it. So, I feel we've got a wonderful opportunity to expand the brand. BJ's is just one of many examples.
Stephen Anderson - Maxim Group LLC
All right. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Nigel Travis for closing remarks.
Nigel Travis - Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.
Okay. Well, firstly thank you, everyone, for coming on today. I recognize that this is probably getting towards the end of your earnings season. And because there was an important meeting that we had to attend in Washington, we moved our earnings call. But I'd like to leave you with five takeaways.
One, we remain very focused on our six-part strategy. We are extremely confident we have the right plan, and that will deliver future growth. Secondly, major part of that plan is maintaining our digital leadership. I think that's the major advantage for both Dunkin' and Baskin, and really does help us differentiate.
Thirdly, we're very focused on the people issues that our franchisees are concerned about. And, hopefully, I think that when I look at our relationships with our franchisees and our focus on unit economics, the fact that they've invested so heavily is a major demonstration and confidence that they have in our brands. And, finally, we're very committed to shareholder value. So, I think Kate answered that very succinctly. So, hopefully, everyone gets the message that we're looking at every level we have to build our business forward.
So, with that, thank you very much. And have a good day.
