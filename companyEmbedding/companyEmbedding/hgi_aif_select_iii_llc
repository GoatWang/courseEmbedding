Annuities are long-term products designed for retirement. Early withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% federal tax may apply. An investment in a variable annuity involves investment risk, including possible loss of principal. The contract, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the total amount invested. Retirement plans and accounts such as an IRA, 401(k), etc., are tax-deferred (and subject to required minimum distributions) regardless of whether or not they are funded with an annuity.Variable annuities are sold by prospectus only. The prospectus contains the investment objectives, risks, fees, charges, expenses and other information regarding the contract and underlying funds, which should be considered carefully before investing. A prospectus may be obtained from your financial advisor or by calling 1-800-445-7862. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing. Annuities are issued by American General Life Insurance Company (AGL) or, in New York, by The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York (US Life), except the Polaris Platinum Elite and Polaris Choice Elite variable annuities, which are issued by The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC) in all states. All products and features may not be available in all states. The purchase of an annuity is not required for, and is not a term of, the provision of any banking service or activity. The Company, its distributors and representatives are not authorized to give legal, tax or accounting advice. Applicable laws and regulations are complex and subject to change. Any tax statements in this material are not intended to suggest the avoidance of U.S. federal, state or local tax penalties. For advice concerning your situation, consult your professional attorney, tax advisor or accountant. Variable annuities are distributed by AIG Capital Services, Inc.
