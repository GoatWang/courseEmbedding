There’s the traditional way independent coffee shops grow, and then there’s the way Five Watt Coffee is doing it.
The Minneapolis coffeehouse, like many others in the Twin Cities, is a destination for java lovers who want flavor, not just a caffeine jolt.
Five Watt saw quick success shortly after opening in May 2014, drawing hipsters and coffee junkies from around the region. But what the owners didn’t expect was an offer — just three months after they opened — from a beverage distributor to take their cold press coffee national in cans.


“We thought a second shop was our next step, but instead we skipped ahead 10 years,” said Lee Carter, co-founder of Five Watt Coffee and one of five owners of its new parent company, Big Watt Cold Beverage Co.
In just about a year and a half, Carter and Five Watt co-founder Caleb Garn brought on three new business partners, formed Big Watt, acquired local bean roasting company Round Table and built a 5,700-square-foot manufacturing facility.
Two weeks ago, Big Watt cold press drinks landed on convenience store shelves in the Twin Cities. By mid-spring, Big Watt’s taproom and cafe concept will be open. By summer, the company aims to be pumping out 22,000 cases of cold press each month, and by August, its product could be on shelves in other big markets like Phoenix and Dallas.

                  Stacks of cans sat waiting to be filled with Big Watt cold press coffee at Burning Brothers Brewing in St. Paul. By summer, Big Watt aims to be pumping out 22,000 cases a month.
              






“It was always one thing leading to another,” Carter said. “It’s all about the opportunity window and you have to get going on an idea when the time is right.”

Big Watt is capitalizing on a change in consumer food habits in favor of premium, local and handcrafted products that range from produce to meat to baked goods. This broader trend dovetails with the coffee renaissance, often called third-wave coffee, that has created an appetite for coffee beverages that are treated with attention to details — like wine — and less like a commodity.
“These third-wave coffee concepts speak to a larger trend in the market,” said Lauren Hallow, associate editor of concept analysis at Technomic Inc., a Chicago-based food industry research firm. “Consumers are really gravitating toward the flavors that are real. There’s this appeal in going back to the basics and discovering that coffee tastes great on its own.”
Cold press, called cold brew outside the Upper Midwest, is a process of steeping coffee grounds in cold or room-temperature water for at least 12 hours. It’s different from iced coffee, which is hot brewed coffee chilled over ice. Tastes vary, but cold press is generally thought to be smoother and less bitter than iced coffee.
Mentions of cold brew on food service menus have increased 25 percent between the third quarter of 2014 and the same period this year, according to Technomic, a market researcher. Caribou Coffee, based in Brooklyn Center, has offered cold brew since it started in 1992, and it is testing a variant called “nitro coffee” that infuses nitrogen gas to give the drink tiny bubbles and a creamier feel.
Three years ago, Carter and Garn were a couple of guitar-playing baristas experimenting with new coffee drinks. Carter worked at Bull Run Coffee Bar on Lyndale Avenue in south Minneapolis, a shop that Garn managed. After the two opened Five Watt Coffee, Jason Westplate, a beverage industry consultant, offered to design a beer, wine and cocktail program and a line of coffee bitters for them. “After talking to Jason, I realized this brand could be way bigger than I imagined,” Carter said.

That’s when they formed the second firm, Big Watt Cold Beverage Co., in order to build strong relationships with other coffee shops without imposing the Five Watt brand on them. Then came an offer from Core Beverage, an Edina-based wholesaler of coffees, teas and related items, to distribute their cold press to its customers across the country.
“We approached them because they are local and had the idea of putting it into a really attractive can package,” said Roger Lund, owner of Core Beverage. “We were looking for a cold coffee beverage. There’s a giant growth potential on the retail side of things.”
The Big Watt partners knew they would need more money, equipment, space and people. “We were imagining our hands falling off from handpressing that much,” Carter said. “So we started discussing how to mass produce.”
For starters, the 5-gallon buckets they were using to develop the coffees were not going to cut it. Buying an 80-gallon fermentation tank “was a game changer,” Carter said.
They also needed a lot more coffee beans. Big Watt’s primary roaster was Roundtable Coffee Works, a small St. Paul-based roasting company. Westplate and Carter knew their bean orders would fill Round Table’s pipeline and that it would be more economical to buy out the roastery. Round Table’s owner, Shawn Person, was added as a Big Watt owner, as was Alex Gese, who joined in as the finance-minded partner to help manage and connect them to capital.

And then there was the space issue. After a long search, they found their new production home at 2904 Harriet Av. in south Minneapolis and are currently building out the processing and taproom space inside. In the interim, they formed a relationship with Burning Brothers Brewing in St. Paul to temporarily lease space for development and production.
Logistics were the easy part. Now came the challenge of creating a can of cold press with a shelf life that would be suitable for retail.
Other indie coffee shops around the country, like Portland’s famed Stumptown Coffee and New York’s Gorilla Coffee, produce cold press with a much shorter shelf life, around two months compared with Big Watt’s 16 months. Starbucks is on the other end of the spectrum, making plenty of cold bottled beverages — but not cold press — with mass appeal.
Big Watt’s $3 price falls right between its peer products in the artisanal segment, which average 80 cents more, and the Starbucks segment, which average 60 cents less. The founders believe its “high drinkability” distinguishes it from some other brand’s cold press, such as Dunn Bros.’ Infinite Black, which packs a heavy flavor punch. This, coupled with a more reasonable price, could capture some customers from Starbucks, they say, while coffee purists will love its simplicity.
The ingredients for its original cold press are just water and coffee. As for its infused cold press drinks, which the owners say will hit shelves this summer and will be its signature products, only the raw flavor ingredient will be added during the steeping process. The same infusion principle that applies to homemade cucumber water applies to Big Watt’s cold press.

                  Jason Westplate checked on the progress in the fermentation tank at Burning Brothers Brewing in St. Paul.
              



“We don’t need to hire a scientist to make something taste like spruce. We just need spruce,” Carter said.
Carter and Westplate spent months tinkering with the ingredient ratios, brew time and other variables — and dumped gallons upon gallons of coffee along the way.
“It’s been a painful process. We’ve done large-scale production on grass-roots money,” Westplate said. “But we hope everything the company does in the future will be made easier because this first year was done right.”
If the cans are well received by the public and Big Watt saturates the Twin Cities market as quickly as the owners hope, the company will be cash positive in a year.
After rolling out the cold press product in other U.S. markets, Big Watt will look at wider distribution of its cocktail bitters and the creation of a Big Watt soda line.

Other indie coffee shops around the country, like Portland’s famed Stumptown Coffee and New York’s Gorilla Coffee, produce cold press with a much shorter shelf life, around two months compared with Big Watt’s 16 months. Starbucks is on the other end of the spectrum, making plenty of cold bottled beverages — but not cold press — with mass appeal.
Big Watt’s $3 price falls right between its peer products in the artisanal segment, which average 80 cents more, and the Starbucks segment, which average 60 cents less. The founders believe its “high drinkability” distinguishes it from some other brand’s cold press, such as Dunn Bros.’ Infinite Black, which packs a heavy flavor punch. This, coupled with a more reasonable price, could capture some customers from Starbucks, they say, while coffee purists will love its simplicity.
The ingredients for its original cold press are just water and coffee. As for its infused cold press drinks, which the owners say will hit shelves this summer and will be its signature products, only the raw flavor ingredient will be added during the steeping process. The same infusion principle that applies to homemade cucumber water applies to Big Watt’s cold press.















        Courtney Perry, Special to the Star Tribune
      

                  Jason Westplate checked on the progress in the fermentation tank at Burning Brothers Brewing in St. Paul.
              



“We don’t need to hire a scientist to make something taste like spruce. We just need spruce,” Carter said.
Carter and Westplate spent months tinkering with the ingredient ratios, brew time and other variables — and dumped gallons upon gallons of coffee along the way.
“It’s been a painful process. We’ve done large-scale production on grass-roots money,” Westplate said. “But we hope everything the company does in the future will be made easier because this first year was done right.”
If the cans are well received by the public and Big Watt saturates the Twin Cities market as quickly as the owners hope, the company will be cash positive in a year.
After rolling out the cold press product in other U.S. markets, Big Watt will look at wider distribution of its cocktail bitters and the creation of a Big Watt soda line.

With bundles of energy, sunny Lee is a loveable rogue... but is that because he’s never had to grow up?

About Lee
Lee Carter is the eldest of Mick and Linda’s children and has been doted on ever since the day he was born. Gifted with his dad’s patter and his mum’s brass neck, Lee rarely meets someone he can’t charm. As a result of this, Lee’s never had to find out what hard work is - and if he’s being honest, he doesn’t really want to.
Lee loves his family, even if sometimes they drive him up the wall. Lee’s charismatic and a true fighter. Despite their fears over Lee’s safety, Mick and Linda  couldn’t be more proud of having a son fighting for Queen and country. The Army has made a man of Lee, but has it also damaged him? Lee was in charge of Bomb Disposal.

Backstory
Lee Michael Carter was born in 1992. Lee was named after Lee Majors, due to when Mick first picked him up he thought he was a little 
tough guy.
When Lee was 14 he was obsessed with a girl in his school that he thought was out of his league. They went to a disco and got together but a week later they broke up and Lee kept playing their song "Apologise", on a loop for weeks. It drove Mick and Linda insane.
On Mother's Day, Lee's Dad Mick had forgot that it was Mother's Day because he was so busy working all hours. Lee's Mother Linda was upset, she pretend not to be but Lee could tell even though he was only a young child. Lee took all of his pocket money, went to the corner shop and bought Linda an Easter egg with a drawing by Beatrix Potter that had rabbit and daffodils on the front. Lee told Linda he didn't have enough for flowers so he bought her some chocolate with flowers on the box instead.

Storylines
When the Carters move into Albert Square, Lee is serving in the army and speaks with his mother Linda using the web. Three months later, his father Mick visits Stan Mick's father, but before he can reach the flat he is hit by an unknown youth, and afterwards Mick discloses to  that he believes that the man was his son, Lee. A week later, it is Lee who saves Stan from a fire at the Queen Victoria. The family meet at the hospital. When his father asks him why he punched him, he confirms that he was in Stan's flat. Lee then has sex with Whitney. However she insists it was a one time thing. He begins pursuing instead, but later resumes his fling with Lucy. When Lucy is found dead, the police take a DNA sample from Lee, before he returns to the army. When he returns, Lee tries to charm Whitney again but she rejects him. However, after striving and striving, he finally succeeds! Until the Carters get the Butchers in trouble when Tina's drugs get found by Tiffany.
Lee later married Whitney but has trouble at work and is being bullied by a colleague. Lee also has money worries and temporarily unites with Oz and arranges a robbery on The Vic. Lee does not live up to his side of the bargain later on and his share of the proceeds is denied. Lee becomes increasingly depressed and contemplates suicide by jumping from a car park roof but is comforted and talked down by the security guard.

            Report an Incident Involving this Product          






The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.
