Moreover, L Catterton has a deep understanding of our industry through its investment in Ideal Image, the largest laser hair removal company in North America. We are confident that together, we will unlock Espaçolaser’s untapped potential to bring our unique value proposition to more men and women across Brazil.” 





Mr. lasz de Morais added, “L Catterton’s unparalleled experience building leading consumer brands around the world and deep understanding of the consumer market makes them the ideal partner for Espaçolaser.

With L Catterton, we look forward to expanding our footprint and diversifying our business as we continue our path of innovation in the Brazilian market.”
“Espaçolaser has experienced rapid growth and today is the clear market leader in Brazil,” said Julio Babecki, Partner, L Catterton Latin America.
“With a loyal and growing customer base, high brand awareness, strong fundamentals and ample runway to expand in Brazil and beyond, Espaçolaser’s value proposition is unmatched. Ygor, Paulo and the entire management team have done an incredible job establishing a strong foothold in the market, and we look forward to working with them to build on their winning position.”

 Follow @stephanierogan





L Catterton made a growth capital investment in Bogota, Columbia-based Bodytech Corp, the second-largest gym company in Latin America, according to a news release. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Bodytech is the first investment by the L Catterton Latin America fund.
PRESS RELEASE
BOGOTA, Colombia and GREENWICH, Conn. and LONDON, March 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Bodytech Corporation (“Bodytech”), the second-largest gym company in Latin America, today announced a significant growth capital investment by L Catterton, the largest consumer-focused private equity firm in the world. L Catterton’s investment will be used to support and accelerate Bodytech’s continued growth throughout Latin America. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Bodytech has more than 140 locations in Colombia, Peru and Chile. Its offerings include full service gyms (via the Bodytech & Sportlife brands), high performance gyms (Bodytech Sports Medicine), gyms for kids (Bodytech Active Kids) and Life Fitness gym products sold for personal and commercial use. Bodytech is focused on building full-service gym locations with offerings such as advanced cardio and weight training, group classes from indoor cycling to pilates and yoga, swimming pools, and sauna/spa services. In addition, Bodytech has a network of doctors, physiotherapists and nutritionists to provide integrated health services to its members. 





Since its founding in 1997 by Nicolás Loaiza and Gigliola Aycardi, the company has experienced rapid growth in major metropolitan markets across Latin America. Bodytech has approximately 280,000 customers and has grown its annual revenues by 20 percent per year in recent years. With gym penetration low across the region and increasing demand for wellness offerings, Bodytech and L Catterton see a significant opportunity to continue the company’s growth through organic and inorganic expansion. Mr. Loaiza will remain Chief Executive Officer and Ms. Aycardi will remain Executive Vice President of the company.
“This investment will allow us to continue our rapid growth and expansion to help more people in the region improve their health and well-being through exercise and better nutrition,” said Mr. Loaiza. “The fact that the preeminent consumer investor is partnering with Bodytech demonstrates the strong positioning of our product. We plan to put the investment to use quickly, accelerating our development of gyms in Colombia, Peru and Chile, and we anticipate opening new geographies in the future. With L Catterton, we will have the resources, industry knowledge and global expertise that we need to take our brand to the next level.”
“We are excited to partner with Bodytech, the fitness market leader in Latin America,” said Dirk Donath, Managing Partner, L Catterton Latin America. “Bodytech is uniquely positioned to capture growth across various segments of the fitness category, which has been fueled by increased consumer awareness of health, wellness and nutrition. We look forward to partnering with Bodytech’s strong team to support the company’s expansion plans. Bodytech is the first investment from the LCLA II fund, and an ideal complement to L Catterton’s health and wellness oriented portfolio.” 





Bodytech is the first investment by the L Catterton Latin America (“LCLA II”) fund, which will focus on investing in the Latin American region. L Catterton has significant experience investing in the high growth fitness, wellness and athletics space, including investments in Core Power Yoga, the leading yoga studio operator; Pure Barre, the largest and most recognized barre fitness concept; Peloton, a cutting edge provider of technology enabled, vertically integrated, at-home fitness offerings; and Sweaty Betty, a premium international activewear brand.
About Bodytech 
Bodytech, the second-largest gym company in Latin America, was created in 1997 by Nicolás Loaiza and Gigliola Aycardi as part of their MBA graduation project for the University of the Andes in Bogota, Colombia. Currently, it has more than 75 locations in Colombia, 18 in Peru, and 48 in Chile. Its aim is to help more people in Latin America improve their health and well-being through exercise and improved nutrition. Bodytech’s offerings include full service gyms, high performance gyms, gyms for children and Life Fitness gym products sold for personal and commercial use. Bodytech is focused on building full-service gym locations across Latin America with offerings such as advanced cardio and weight training, group fitness classes, swimming pools, saunas and spa services. In addition, Bodytech has a network of doctors, physiotherapists, and nutritionists to provide integrated health services to its members. Bodytech is an active member of Endeavor, the leading high-impact entrepreneurship network around the world. Aycardi and Loaiza were nominees to the World Entrepreneur of the Year Award from Ernst & Young in 2015.
