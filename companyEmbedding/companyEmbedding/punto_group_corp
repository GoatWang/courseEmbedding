The above figures represent only estimated costs. If necessary, Mr. Kriukov, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be necessary if the
proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement our business
plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin
Board when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr. Kriukov will not be paid any compensation
or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the
repayment of the funds advanced by Mr. Kriukov. Mr. Kriukov will be repaid from
revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


The overall market for project management online systems is rapidly evolving and
subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs and frequent
introductions of new systems and applications. We believe there are a limited
number of direct competitors that provide an online project management systems
for small business offering. However, we will face competition both from project
management software companies and cloud-based online systems. Many of our
competitors have long history and image.

Primarily we focus on the needs of small business given their particular
simplicity of operations and management of the mono project.

The principal competitive factors in our market are application functionality,
ease of use of applications, total cost of ownership, levels of customer
support, brand reputation, capability for integration of applications, ability
respond to customer needs. Since we have not yet commenced operations or
developed software, there is a substantial uncertainty that we compete favorably
on the basis of these factors.


Company Description
Punto Group, Corp. intends to develop the internet-based project management
software for small business. Our project management software enables
organizations to plan, manage and execute any business projects. Our software
applications will help organizations better optimize all kind of


 project
resources and plan and control all business processes online. We are going to
provide an online service of the project management system, a mobile
application, and technical support. Our online system and software applications
address a broad range of business activity, from planning to task execution. We
intend to offer a complete solution for small businesses that allows them to
manage projects online with easy access to the user's files in real time and
project’s team collaboration. The main result for businesses is mobility in
decision-making and real-time projects’ operation controlling online. We believe
that our system is easy-to-use, highly productive and offer real-time project
management in any location. However, there is no assurance that we will achieve
our business objectives in the future.

The Board
of Directors and Stockholders of
Punto Group, Corp.




 

 

We have
reviewed the accompanying balance sheets of Punto Group, Corp. as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the related
statements of operations and comprehensive loss, and statements of
cash flows for the three and nine month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of
the company’s management.

 

We
conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of
interim financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in
scope than an audit conducted in accordance with standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the
financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not
express such an opinion.

 

Based on
our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that
should be made to the accompanying interim financial statements
referred to above for them to be in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.

 

We have
previously audited, in accordance with auditing standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
balance sheet of Punto Group, Corp. as of December 31, 2015, and
the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss,
stockholders’ deficiency, and cash flows for the year then
ended and in our report dated April 14, 2016, we expressed an
unqualified opinion on those financial statements. In our opinion,
the information set forth in the accompanying balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the balance sheet from which it has been
derived.

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note
2 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial
losses in previous years, which raises substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in
regards to these matters are also described in Note 2. These
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

OPERATIONS




 

Punto
Group, Corp. (the “Company”) is a for profit
corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of
Nevada, United States of America on September 2, 2014.

 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The
financial statements and related disclosures as of September 30,
2016 are reviewed pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”).

 

Unless
the context otherwise requires, all references to “Punto
Group, Corp.,” “we,” “us,”
“our” or the “company” are to Punto Group,
Corp. and any subsidiaries.

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN




 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).

 

The
statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC"). Accordingly, certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and other information included in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as
filed with the SEC.

 

Going
Concern

 

The
accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. For the
period ended September 30, 2016, the Company had accumulated
deficits of $61,538. The Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to
generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably or raise
additional capital through debt financing and/or through sales of
common stock.

 

Management
plans to fund operations of the Company through the proceeds from
an offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 or
private placements of restricted securities or the issuance of
stock in lieu of cash for payment of services until such a time as
profitable operations are achieved. If we do not raise all of the
money we need from public offerings, we will have to find
alternative sources, such as loans or advances from our officers,
directors or others. Such additional financing may not become
available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that
any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be
sufficient to meet its needs in the long term. There are no written
agreements in place for such funding or issuance of securities and
there can be no assurance that such will be available in the
future. Management believes that this plan provides an opportunity
for the Company to continue as a going concern.

 

The
failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability or obtain
the additional funding would be detrimental to the
Company.

SUMMARY OF
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




 

Use of
Estimates and Assumptions

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

 

Due to the
limited level of operations, the Company has not had to make
material assumptions or estimates other than the assumption that
the Company is a going concern.

 

Cash and
Cash Equivalents

 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash
equivalents.

 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

 

ASC 825,
“Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments”, requires disclosure of fair value information
about financial instruments.  ASC 820, “Fair Value
Measurements” defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles,
and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market
assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of
September 30, 2016.

 

The
respective carrying values of certain on-balance-sheet financial
instruments approximate their fair values.  These financial
instruments include cash, accrued liabilities and notes
payable.  Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying
values for these financial instruments since they are short term in
nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair
value.

 

Basic and
Diluted Loss Per Share

 

The
Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC
260-10-45 “Earnings per Share”, which requires
presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the
face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per
share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding
common shares during the period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per
share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period.  Dilutive earnings (loss) per
share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is
anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments,
and therefore, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are
equal.

Revenue
Recognition

 

The
Company will recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting
Standards Codification No. 605, “Revenue Recognition”
("ASC-605"). ASC-605 requires that four basic criteria must be met
before revenue can be recognized:

 




 



1.



Persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists





 



2.



Delivery
has occurred





 



3.



The
selling price is fixed and determinable





 



4.



Collectability
is reasonably assured.




 

Determination
of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management's judgment
regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products
delivered and the collectability of those amounts. Provisions for
discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and
allowances, or other adjustments are provided for in the same
period the related sales are recorded. The Company will defer any
revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject
to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly
determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be
required.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

The
Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company’s
results of operat

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What is a limited liability company?
A limited liability company, or LLC, is a business entity created under state law that combines characteristics of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, the owners of an LLC are generally not personally liable for company debts. Like a sole proprietorship or a partnership, an LLC is, by default, a "pass through" entity for tax purposes. This means that the LLC does not pay taxes on its profits, but instead, profits and losses are "passed through" to the owners, who must then pay tax on their share of LLC income.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


What is the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation. S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business?
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn more.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Corporation FAQ
Find FAQs related to forming a corporation.
















What are the main differences between a C corporation and an S corporation?


C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, one tax at the corporate level on the corporation's net income, and another tax to the shareholders when the profits are distributed. S corporations have only one level of taxation. All of their income is allocated to the shareholders.
However, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability. In addition, S corporations are subject to limitations, such as the number and type of shareholders they can have.
LegalZoom will help you start a C corporation or an S corporation. Get started by answering a few questions about your company, and we will file your paperwork with the Secretary of State.



 





How do I choose a corporate name?


In general, the name of a corporation must end with "incorporated,"
            "corporation" or an abbreviation of one of these. A name will not be accepted
            if it is likely to mislead the public or if it too closely resembles the name
            of another corporation already formed in that state. Many states also
            restrict the use of certain terms in a corporation's name (like bank, police
            or insurance).
LegalZoom allows you to choose up to three alternative names, in order of
            preference. We will conduct a name check before filing to see which names are
            available. Please note that for government purposes the names "ABC, Inc." and
            "A.B.C., Corp." are identical. Therefore, you should disregard spaces, periods
            and the corporate ending when coming up with your three name
            choices.
If the name of your corporation will be used in connection with
            goods or services, you may wish to consider obtaining federal trademark
            protection for the name. This helps ensure that no one else in the U.S. may use
            that name in connection with the same general type of goods or services
            (except in areas where someone else is already using that
            name).



 





Is a corporation required to have a registered agent?


Each corporation must have a registered agent  (some states use the term "resident agent" 
            or "statutory agent," but the concept is the same). This is the person
            designated to receive official state correspondence and notice if the
            corporation is served with a lawsuit. Most states require that the registered agent must be
            either:

(1) an adult living in the state of formation with a street
              address (P.O. boxes are not acceptable) or
(2) a corporation or limited liability company with a business office in the state of formation
              that provides registered agent services.

One of the advantages of forming a corporation or limited liability company in your home state is
            that any officer or director (of a corporation) or manager or member (of an LLC) can act as the registered agent. However, there
            are some advantages to having another person or company act as your
            registered agent. First, this adds an extra layer of privacy, since the
            registered agent's name and address are publicly available. Second, this
            helps limit the risk that if your corporation or LLC is named as a defendant in a lawsuit, no one will surprise
            you at home on a Sunday night with court papers.



 





How much will it cost to form and run a corporation?


Each state charges an annual fee to maintain a corporation. In many
            states, you must also submit an "annual report" or "list of directors and
            officers," which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have
            state taxes.



 





What are the advantages of incorporating in Delaware?


The advantages of incorporating in Delaware according to the Delaware Secretary of State: 
More than half a million business entities have their legal home in Delaware. This includes more than half of all U.S. publicly-traded and Fortune 500 companies. Businesses choose Delaware for its complete incorporation services package, which includes modern and flexible corporate laws, the highly-respected Delaware Courts, a business-friendly state government and the customer service oriented staff of the Delaware Division of Corporations. 



 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


An LLC has more operating flexibility and fewer
            corporate formalities than an S corporation. For example, an S corporation
            cannot have more than 100 stockholders and must hold both periodic director's
            meetings and an annual meeting of stockholders. However, owners of an S
            corporation may be subject to fewer taxes than LLC owners.
            For more information, please see "Differences
            Between a Corporation and a Limited Liability Company (LLC)" from the main
            guide.


 





Do I need an attorney to form a corporation?


No, you do not need an attorney to form a corporation. You can
            prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a legal
            documentation service such as LegalZoom.
To learn more and speak with a representative, please call us at
            (888) 381-8758.



 





What is the procedure for forming a corporation, and what legal documents are required?


To create a corporation, you must file a document called the "articles of incorporation" 
            with the Secretary of State or other appropriate state agency. Next,
            bylaws and organizing resolutions must be adopted. A corporation will also
            need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS.
Unlike many other incorporation services which only
            create and file the articles of incorporation, LegalZoom can 
            complete all of these required documents for you, including personalized bylaws
            and organizational resolutions.



 





What are the advantages of incorporating in Nevada?


According to the Nevada Secretary of State, the following details the advantages of incorporating in Nevada: 

No corporate income tax 

No taxes on corporate shares 
No franchise tax 
No personal income tax 
No I.R.S. information sharing agreement 
Nominal annual fees 
Minimal reporting and disclosure requirements 
Stockholders are not on public record 



 





What are the naming conventions for professional corporations?


Have you ever noticed the initials "P.C." or "P.A." after a company's
            name? These initials indicate the company is a professional corporation ("P.C.") 
            or a professional association ("P.A."). State law dictates what is required in the 
            name, and those requirements differ by state.



 





What is a professional corporation?


Professional corporations (PC) are corporations that provide
            professional services. State law and the regulating board determine what
            constitutes professional services and when you are required to be a
            professional corporation. This varies from state to
            state.



 





Can I be the only shareholder in my corporation?


Yes, a corporation can be formed with only one shareholder.
            However, corporate formalities, such as director and shareholder meetings,
            are still required in order to preserve the corporate form and prevent the
            shareholder from personal liability.



 





What is a corporation?



            A corporation is a distinct legal entity created under state laws which can
            open a bank account, purchase property, enter into contracts and operate a
            business. One of the most important features of a corporation is that,
            generally, its owners are not personally liable for the debts of the
            corporation.


 





When is a corporation considered a professional corporation?


The definition of "professionals" can vary from state to state, but typically includes professions that require a license, such as doctors, chiropractors, lawyers, dentists, accountants, architects or engineers. Depending on the state where you incorporate, the following activities may be classified as professional services. 
Accounting and financial services 
Architectural services
Legal services
Medical services



 





Where should I incorporate?


A corporation can incorporate in any of the 50 states, plus the
            District of Columbia. Many people choose to incorporate in their home
            state, which can save money in filing fees. That is because corporations are
            required to register in each state where they do business. For example, a
            Delaware corporation that has its main business office in Arkansas must
            register as a "foreign corporation" with the Arkansas Secretary of
            State and must pay applicable fees and taxes to both Delaware and Arkansas. Delaware is popular
            because of its history, experience and pro-business climate. Nevada is also
            popular because of its pro-business environment and lack of a formal
            information-sharing agreement with the IRS. Please read the next two FAQs for
            more specifics on each state.



 





Who can form a corporation?


Generally, anyone who completes the articles of incorporation and pays the
            state filing fee can form a corporation. There are usually no residency or
            other legal requirements. However, many states require that an individual forming 
            a corporation must be at least 18 years old.
