Asbestos Containing Products

Asbestos Containing Products
 Asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was used widely in products and industrial settings until it was eventually banned. Once hailed as "wonder mineral", asbestos was utilized mainly for its durability and resistance to heat, making it a vital component of many manufactured goods, building materials, packaging, gaskets, coatings and friction products. 
From 1900 to the 1980s, asbestos was used in more than 3000 products. In addition, more than 30 million tons of the mineral were utilized in schools, power plants, buildings, homes and industrial facilities. Unfortunately, when any of these products become disturbed, they release asbestos fibers which can be inhaled into the body and may eventually cause mesothelioma, asbestosis and lung cancer. 
The Environmental Protection Agency deems any item with 1% or more asbestos to be an asbestos-containing product.

					NOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING MOTION AND, IF FILED, DETERMINED  IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL OF FLORIDA SECOND DISTRICT  JACK S. CAREY and GLORIA DUBOIS,  ) ) Appellants/Cross-Appellees, ) ) v. ) ) JACQUELINE ROCKE, ) ) Appellee/Cross-Appellant. ) ___________________________________ )  Case No. 2D08-4445  Opinion filed October 23, 2009. Appeal from the Circuit Court for Pinellas County; Lauren C. Laughlin, Judge. Joseph W. Fleece, III of Baskin Fleece, Clearwater, for Appellants/Cross-Appellees. Gwynne A. Young, John R. Blue and Sylvia H. Walbolt of Carlton Fields, P.A., Tampa, and Jonathan B. Sbar of Rocke, McLean & Sbar, P.A., Tampa, for Appellee/CrossAppellant.  KHOUZAM, Judge.  Jack S. Carey and Gloria DuBois appeal a final order granting in part and denying in part Jacqueline Rocke's objection to the petition for administration of the February 1994 will of Virginia Murphy. The trial court voided the residuary clause of the   will based upon a finding that Mr. Carey (the decedent's attorney) and Ms. DuBois (Mr. Carey's legal assistant) failed to show that the residuary bequests to them were free from undue influence; declared that the residuary estate would pass by intestacy; and admitted the balance of the will to probate. Ms. Rocke, Mrs. Murphy's cousin, crossappeals contending that the trial court should have allowed the residuary estate to pass to her under the bequest in Mrs. Murphy's February 1992 will so that the residuary estate would pass by testacy rather than intestacy. We affirm without discussion in all but one respect. In its well-reasoned and lengthy order the trial court explained why the residuary clause of the February 1994 will had to be voided. The trial court then determined that the residuary estate would pass by intestacy rather than by testate succession under a residuary clause set forth in one of Mrs. Murphy's many prior wills. We are unable to determine from the record whether the trial court considered the doctrine of dependent relative revocation in deciding that the residuary estate should pass by intestacy. See Wehrheim v. Golden Pond Assisted Living Facility, 905 So. 2d 1002, 1007-10 (Fla. 5th DCA 2005) (discussing the doctrine of dependent relative revocation). Because we cannot make that determination based on the record before us and the decision as to whether the residuary clause in one of Mrs. Murphy's prior wills is enforceable necessarily requires factual determinations in this case, we reverse this portion of the order and remand for further proceedings on this issue. Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  FULMER and WALLACE, JJ., Concur.  -2-

 Smithfield Foods Announces New CFO 
 Mon, 06/09/2008 - 11:05am 
 Comments 
 by  

 



SMITHFIELD, Va. (AP) -- Pork producer Smithfield Foods Inc. said Monday it named Robert W. Manly IV as its new chief financial officer, effective July 1.
Manly previously served as an executive vice president at the company. The 55-year-old previously served as president and chief operating officer of Premium Standard Farms.
The company says Carey J. Dubois, who has been serving as CFO, will fill the newly created position of vice president of finance.
The 48-year-old Dubois took over as CFO in 2007 at the Smithfield-based company.
Last week, Smithfield Foods announced that fourth-quarter profit fell 94 percent, hurt by rising grain costs and falling hog prices.
Profit for the quarter ended April 27 was $2.4 million, compared with a profit of $37.1 million a year ago. Revenue rose 20 percent to $2.87 billion from $2.39 billion last year.
