My Philosophy and Approach to Wellness...
My passion as an internal medicine physician is to provide you with personalized healthcare that emphasizes prevention and wellness. It is my sincere belief that the practice of primary care medicine should include a partnership between patient and doctor based upon earned mutual trust and respect. As an MDVIP-affiliated physician, I am able to spend more time with my patients which will enable us to cultivate closer relationships and develop a wellness and prevention plan that is individualized for each patient’s needs and desires. 

With over 25 years of experience practicing internal medicine in Northwest Arkansas, I have developed relationships with many fine specialists to help assist us with your individual care. I want to create a medical experience centered around the patient. I have found that stronger doctor-patient relationships lead to better outcomes and patient satisfaction.

My specific areas of interest are cardiovascular health, prevention and wellness medicine, prevention of cancer and men’s and women’s health.

Our practice of pre-titling for all of our work insures you come to the settlement table with no surprises and complete confidence.

Purchasing a home may be the biggest investment you make. As with every investment, you've done your research and know you've found the home for you. While the house and land may be tangible, visible assets, the actual title to own and possess the property is not. That's where title companies come in. We research the title, examine all current and previous owners and interest holders, as well as any open mortgages, liens, judgments or taxes. We insure that your purchase is exactly what you're expecting and facilitate the transfer of the title from seller to buyer.

Many of these items will also state Free store pickup or Free store pickup today below the free shipping information. If you see these words on the product page for your item, you have the additional option to pick the item up for free at your chosen Walmart location or receive it at your designated location for free as long as you spend $35 or more.
