                  He's ultimately my favorite teacher of all time at fidm this far. He's the clearest, most helpful and most shockingly witty teacher I have experienced at this institution. As a grauate from UC Berkeley, i can honestly say he has properly won my admiration and respect.

                  He's hard, but he's right. He knows good design and if he's hard on you, he's trying to help you. It's one of the few courses where your design will actually be critiqued.

                  he made students feel embarrassed when they asked questions. I was at his open lab, thank god I didnt actually take his class. He seems like he just hates people in general, why is he a teacher

                  I will tell you that he is very honest and his lectures take up the almost every class time. He has a very experience background. Be nice and don't give him attitude, talk back or give excuses. Don't ask obvious questions, because he will look annoyed but answer your question. He seriously scared people the first two weeks. Just do your work!

                  He's hilarious and extremely helpful, provided that you actually want to learn. If you just want to complain and not do the work, you can't blame the teachers from not sugar coating negative comments. It's college, be an adult and treat it as work. It's good to have a teacher who isn't afraid to tell you if your work sucked. That's how you grow.

                  Swiatek is the BEST teacher at this school. Contrary to what others have said, he is extremely helpful. His method of teaching is the best I've come across here. Don't believe others when they say he is unclear or impatient. He WILL help you. Just show your work ethic. I had little interest prior to his class - Now I wish he taught more classes.

                  HE IS AN AWFUL TEACHER! I AM TELLING YOU FROM THE EXPERIENCE DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. ESPECIALLY IF YOUR THE TYPE OF STUDENT THAT ASKS QUESTIONS. HE IS VERY UNCLEAR WHEN TEACHING. HE HAS EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE HIM A GOOD INSTRUCTOR. NOT TO MENTION PSYCHOTIC.

                  He is great at what he does. However, not teacher material. Very low patience, very unclear. Try not to take him for an essentials class, possibly wouldn't be so bad later on, once you have learned. He speaks to you as a colleague. Never took attendance, but based off of the work you brought in (so if not finished to HIS requirements, 0 or absent).

                  Mr. Swiatek is hard, sarcastic and sometimes makes you so mad/upset you wanna cry.. but he'll also teach you more than any other teacher, he's a genius, and will make you crack up laughing. Marc Jacobs, Zach Posen, and Badgley Mischka have all been taught by him. Not gonna lie he's a hard class to take, but its worth it.

                  This is going to be a teacher you'll either love or hate. If you do your work and try, you'll be on his good side. If you give attitude and don't pay attention, he'll notice and he won't be your favorite. But this is how the industry is and these are the types of people you have to deal with. He knows when your trying and when your not.

                  If you care to reach your full potential and learn more than anyone at FIDM, this is the teacher to take. He challenges you to use your brain and I guarantee if you give the class 100% You will be better at patterns than 90% of all other students. He really cares & wants the best out of you!! Dont forget your notches!

                  Just work hard, he'll notice you're trying and give you a good grade. He's only mean if you don't pay attention, talk back, or don't try. Double check your work before you turn it in. He notices notches and balance of the pattern very easily.

                  If you are a top student and eager to learn, you won't find a better teacher than Mr. Swiatek.   He will only give back to you as much as you are willing to give, so be honest about the type of student you are or can become.  PLAY HIS GAME and you'll be so happy to know him and learn from him.  Bad students, don't waste his time, or yours.

                  Best teacher I have ever had at FIDM...he changed my life! If you can't handle him you can't handle being in the fashion industry. His attitude is nothing compared to what you encounter in the real world. He prepares you the most and will help you as long as he sees you are a hard worker. I graduated almost a year ago & still talk to him! THE BEST

                  I really think this teacher is insane. A teacher has to be loved and respected by his students, not this guy. You hate him to the point you dont even want to ask him a question. He yells for no reason and just an all around mentally unstable individual. AVOID!!!!

                  Mr. Swiatek is one of the best teachers at FIDM.  If he sees that you're making an effort to learn he will help you as much as you need.  He's passionate about what he teaches and is more than willing to share his knowledge. He's a wealth of info so take advantage of it while you're in his class!  And go to his studios!
