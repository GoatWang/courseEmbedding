	Red Hat: RHT Stock Looks Even Better After a Solid Q4
Thursday's gains aren't a reason to hold back -- they're a taste of more to come

After yesterday’s market close, open source computer software provider Red Hat Inc (NYSE:RHT) released fourth-quarter earnings data for fiscal year 2015. RHT reported solid figures for the quarter, beating analyst expectations as well as management’s guidance.
Red Hat is up solidly today, but if you’re not yet in RHT stock, don’t worry.
The party is far from over.
RHT Fourth-Quarter Results
Quarterly revenue of $464 million was up 16% year-over-year and beat both analyst expectations of $457 million and management’s guidance of $456 million-$459 million. More than 87% of RHT’s revenue came from subscriptions, and that $405 million portion was 15% higher than subscription revenue in Q4 2013.
Net income for the quarter came in at $48 million, or 26 cents per share, up from 24 cents in the year-ago quarter. Full-year earnings also were up 2 cents, to 95 cents.
Google Watch Will Slaughter Apple Watch
Aside from solid revenue and earnings figures, RHT announced the approval of a $500 million stock repurchase plan, which will replace the $300 million plan that expired the same day. According to the company’s press release, RHT has repurchased more than $1 billion (19.5 million shares) over the past four years.
What This Means for Red Hat Stock
All things considered, yesterday’s report simply reinforces the fact that Red Hat stock still is a solid buy — even after Thursday’s gains.
The company’s open-source cloud infrastructure easily stands toe-to-toe with closed systems such as Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS and Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure platform. Despite RHT being only a fraction of the size of AMZN and MSFT, it’s got quite a bit going for it that should turn into industry-leading profit and growth this year.
One of the most inspiring and exciting things about Red Hat has been the ongoing development and evolution of the OpenStack platform. OpenStack is free, open-source cloud computing technology that began in 2010, and has since become the focus of a global push for hybrid cloud capabilities that are customizable, scalable and — most importantly — secure. Red Hat’s involvement in the project and massive contributions to its evolution demonstrate core fundamentals that place a high value on furthering technology to benefit the entire world, even without direct compensation.
For me, sharing important technological advancements that anyone can use — despite a lack of compensation — shows commendable qualities. The fact that RHT’s earnings and revenues have consistently been stable just validates my opinion that Red Hat has what it takes to survive in an increasingly cutthroat industry.
RHT also is gaining ground on competitors by developing programs to assist businesses with their transition to cloud-based systems. Red Hat’s new Cloud Innovation Practice supports companies entering the cloud and, obviously, steers them toward RHT solutions.
The support system would not have been possible without the acquisition of eNovance, an OpenStack cloud services provider acquired by Red Hat last year. Expertise at eNovance will also allow RHT to take larger steps forward in its innovation and development of the OpenStack platform, which will ultimately result in an even easier time gaining new customers and competing with cloud computing big dogs AMZN and MSFT.
Final Thoughts
With continued focus on improving its suite of enterprise solutions and products, particularly in the cloud computing arena, Red Hat is poised to for another year of strong growth and net earnings.
Existing partnerships with Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), Dell and Quru allow RHT to cooperate with other industry giants to integrate products and software that, together, provide top-quality IT solutions for big businesses.
Red Hat’s president of products and technologies described RHT’s approach and use of open source processes. “The problems we need to solve today can’t be solved by one company,” he said. This methodology and cooperative mentality is responsible for making RHT the world’s open-source leader, and will continue as more partnerships are forged in the future. Utilizing its newly expanded team of cloud experts, Red Hat has the tools it needs to make big moves this year, and RHT stock holders are sure to be rewarded.
As of this writing, Greg Gambone did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

What are analysts saying about Red Hat stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Red Hat stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Red Hat reported strong first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both line. The company is benefiting from strong deal win, improving recurring revenues and cross-selling of cloud-based technology. Based on the strong first-quarter results, management raised fiscal 2018 guidance. We believe Amazon Web Services OpenShift partnership extension reflects strength in Red Hat’s solutions and platform. The acquisition of Codenvy, which will boost its position in the hybrid cloud computing market. Further, it has a strong customer as well as partner base that include the likes of IBM, Intel, Dell Technologies, Google cloud platform and Microsoft Azure. We note that the company has outperformed the S&P 500 index on a year-to-date basis. However, intensifying competition, growing U.S. government exposure and foreign exchange volatility are some of the headwinds, in our view." (6/23/2017)
2. Drexel Hamilton analysts commented, "Last night, Red Hat reported strong 4Q:FY17 results and a better than expected 1Q:FY18 revenue outlook, combined with a solid initial guidance for FY:18. As such, we are increasing our estimates and raising our 12-month price target to $110.00 from $105.00." (3/28/2017)
3. Barclays PLC analysts commented, "A Strong Finish to the Year: After these results, we think Red Hat shares should be able to move higher from current levels. The company delivered on all the main aspects that investors are focused on: healthy billings growth, reacceleration of emerging product growth, strong backlog growth, and the return of leverage in the model. We think that investors will want to pay a higher multiple for a story that is finally coming together, hence, we maintain our Overweight rating." (3/28/2017)
4. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "RHT reported very strong F4Q results that are solid even when taking into account the performance over the last two quarters, including the F3Q quarter that was very weak. Guidance was also better than consensus estimates, but implies only single digit billings growth in the first half, low teens for the year, and no new business growth by our calculations. Margins continue to be flat, which we expect to persist." (3/28/2017)
5. William Blair analysts commented, " Red Hat turned in a strong fiscal fourth quarter, topping revenue consensus by $10 million and meeting the Street estimate on non-GAAP EPS (reported EPS would have been $0.02 higher if not for a higher-than-expected tax rate). The much-scrutinized billings metric accelerated sharply to 29% year-over-year growth versus guidance of midteens growth and compared with 9% and 19% growth in the previous two quarters, respectively. Also noteworthy was rolling-12-month billings growth of 19% (in constant currency), the highest level in five quarters." (3/28/2017)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
