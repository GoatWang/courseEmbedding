History[edit]
MercadoLibre was founded in 1999 in Argentina.[8][7] Founder and CEO Marcos Galperin established the company while attending Stanford University. He acquired funding from John Muse, co-founder of HM Capital Partners.[9][10] MercadoLibre received additional funding from JPMorgan Partners, Flatiron Partners, Goldman Sachs, GE Capital and Banco Santander Central Hispano. In 1999, MercadoLibre was chosen as an Endeavor company.[11]
In September 2001, eBay purchased a 19.5% stake in the company.[9] eBay sold its stake in MercadoLibre in 2016, but the companies continue to collaborate to expand eBay sellers into Latin America.[12][13] eBay opened its first branded store on the MercadoLibre marketplace from Chile in March 2017.[14]
The following month, MercadoLibre acquired iBazar Como, the Brazilian subsidiary of eBay's earlier acquisition, iBazar S.A.[15] In 2006, MercadoLibre.com launched new operations in Costa Rica, Panama and Dominican Republic.
In August 2007, MercadoLibre became the first Latin American technology company to be listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker MELI.[7][9] MercadoLibre acquired competitor DeRemate's operations in August 2008.[16] MercadoLibre also acquired Classified Media Group (CMG) in 2008. CMG established the Latin American e-commerce portals tucarro.com and tuinmueble.com.[17]
MercadoLibre.com expanded its e-commerce portal into Portugal in 2010.[18][19] In 2011, the company transitioned its platform to open source technology. The transition allowed application interface developers (APIs) to expand the platform's solutions and services.[20] In 2013, MercadoLibre launched the MeLi Commerce Fund, dedicated to investing in technology startups that create software using MercadoLibre's APIs.[21] By August 2016, the fund had invested $1.5 million in 15 companies in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.[22][23] MercadoLibre acquired Portal Inmobiliario, a Chilean classified ad website, in 2014.[24] In 2015, MercadoLibre announced its acquisition of Metroscúbicos.com, the portal of Mexico-based real estate company Grupo Expansión.[25]
In 2016, MercadoLibre relocated its headquarters to São Paulo, Brazil. The 17,000 square meter complex, named Melicidade, held a cafeteria, auditorium, gym, beauty parlor, meeting and training rooms, and a recreation area.[26][27] In March 2016, MercadoLibre announced its expansion into Córdoba with its new software center.[28] MercadoLibre opened its first Colombian office in Bogotá in October 2016. It was the company’s fourth customer service center in Latin America.[8][29] The company’s other customer service centers are in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.[30]
Operations[edit]
MercadoLibre operates under five main business units. MarketPlace is its platform for users to sell products, Mercado Pago is its payment platform for online sales, Mercado Publicado is the advertising portion of MercadoLIbre, Mercado Shops is a tool designed to enhance the platform's overall ecosystem,[31] and Mercado Crédito is the company's credit line.[32]
MercadoLibre's MarketPlace is a platform designed to match buyers and sellers. Customers bid for items or pay a set price for offered products. Items are delivered after payment, and users can provide feedback.[33] 3000 official stores or bands work with MercadoLibre.[34]
MercadoLibre also runs a real estate and motors division under the name MercadoLibre Clasificados. Realtors pay a monthly fee to list properties and automobiles on the MercadoLibre platform.[35]
MercadoLibre launched MercadoPago, a secure payment system, to diversify payment options.[36] MercadoPago processed 138.7 million transaction in 2016, which was a 73% improvement from 2015.[34] Launched in 2012, MercadoShops was designed to allow small and medium-sized companies to open virtual stores on their existing websites. The stores feature integration with social network sites.[37] In October 2014, a mobile app was released for MercadoPago which used a credit card reader to allow charges to be processed using a tablet or smartphone using a QR code.[36][38] The company expanded MercadoPago into Colombia in July 2016.[39]
Mercado Crédito's credit process works with buyers and sellers. Rate types for credit lines are determined through a borrower profile.[40]

In August 2007, MercadoLibre became the first Latin American technology company to be listed on the NASDAQ under the ticker MELI.[7][9] MercadoLibre acquired competitor DeRemate's operations in August 2008.[16] MercadoLibre also acquired Classified Media Group (CMG) in 2008. CMG established the Latin American e-commerce portals tucarro.com and tuinmueble.com.[17]
MercadoLibre.com expanded its e-commerce portal into Portugal in 2010.[18][19] In 2011, the company transitioned its platform to open source technology. The transition allowed application interface developers (APIs) to expand the platform's solutions and services.[20] In 2013, MercadoLibre launched the MeLi Commerce Fund, dedicated to investing in technology startups that create software using MercadoLibre's APIs.[21] By August 2016, the fund had invested $1.5 million in 15 companies in Argentina, Brazil and Mexico.[22][23] MercadoLibre acquired Portal Inmobiliario, a Chilean classified ad website, in 2014.[24] In 2015, MercadoLibre announced its acquisition of Metroscúbicos.com, the portal of Mexico-based real estate company Grupo Expansión.[25]
In 2016, MercadoLibre relocated its headquarters to São Paulo, Brazil. The 17,000 square meter complex, named Melicidade, held a cafeteria, auditorium, gym, beauty parlor, meeting and training rooms, and a recreation area.[26][27] In March 2016, MercadoLibre announced its expansion into Córdoba with its new software center.[28] MercadoLibre opened its first Colombian office in Bogotá in October 2016. It was the company’s fourth customer service center in Latin America.[8][29] The company’s other customer service centers are in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.[30]
Operations[edit]
MercadoLibre operates under five main business units. MarketPlace is its platform for users to sell products, Mercado Pago is its payment platform for online sales, Mercado Publicado is the advertising portion of MercadoLIbre, Mercado Shops is a tool designed to enhance the platform's overall ecosystem,[31] and Mercado Crédito is the company's credit line.[32]
MercadoLibre's MarketPlace is a platform designed to match buyers and sellers. Customers bid for items or pay a set price for offered products. Items are delivered after payment, and users can provide feedback.[33] 3000 official stores or bands work with MercadoLibre.[34]
MercadoLibre also runs a real estate and motors division under the name MercadoLibre Clasificados. Realtors pay a monthly fee to list properties and automobiles on the MercadoLibre platform.[35]
MercadoLibre launched MercadoPago, a secure payment system, to diversify payment options.[36] MercadoPago processed 138.7 million transaction in 2016, which was a 73% improvement from 2015.[34] Launched in 2012, MercadoShops was designed to allow small and medium-sized companies to open virtual stores on their existing websites. The stores feature integration with social network sites.[37] In October 2014, a mobile app was released for MercadoPago which used a credit card reader to allow charges to be processed using a tablet or smartphone using a QR code.[36][38] The company expanded MercadoPago into Colombia in July 2016.[39]
Mercado Crédito's credit process works with buyers and sellers. Rate types for credit lines are determined through a borrower profile.[40]

(Nasdaq:MELI) ( http://www.mercadolibre.com), Latin America's leading e-commerce technology company, today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Pedro Arnt, Chief Financial Officer of MercadoLibre, Inc., commented, "We've kicked off the year with a strong first quarter, sustaining the momentum from 2016, which was one of the best years in history for us. The consistent pace of execution this quarter is a direct reflection of our relentless drive to deliver disruptive technology solutions to our users across platforms, devices, and countries where we operate. We remain focused on transforming commerce and financial services through product innovation, fostering entrepreneurship and delivering best in class user experiences, and thus cementing our leadership position in technology, online payments, and ecommerce throughout Latin America."  First Quarter 2017 Business Highlights  Gross Merchandise Volume was $2,334.0 million, a 31.0% increase in USD and a 61.4 % increase on an FX neutral basis. Items sold during the first quarter of 2017 reached 53.2 million, maintaining momentum versus last quarter, and growing 38.6 % year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by strong items growth in Brazil and Mexico, which delivered growth rates of 52.7% and 70.7% respectively versus the first three months of 2016. Unique buyers grew by 20.3% year on year and maintained the solid pace of demand growth observed over the course of last year. MercadoPago kicked off 2017 with an outstanding first quarter, processing $2,601.0 million dollars in Total Payment Volume, an 89.0% year-over-year increase. MercadoPago ended the quarter processing 44.1 million transactions, an increase of 60.1% year-over-year. During the quarter, monetization on the platform continued to improve, driven by penetration gains of MercadoPago across our marketplaces. Penetration of MercadoPago on our platforms rose to 77.4% versus 56.2% when compared to the first quarter of 2016. MercadoPago off platform payments business, saw a Total Payment Volume increase of 109.7% year-over-year in USD and 98.1% in local currencies. This growth was led by Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Chile as commercial efforts to onboard new large clients and increased volume from Mobile Point of Sale solutions continue to deliver positive results. Items shipped through MercadoEnvíos increased 58.7% to 27.3 million items in the first quarter of 2017. Mexico remains on solid footing with envíos penetration reaching 59% (vs. 30% last year), while items shipped increased 220% year on year to 2.6 million. Colombia delivered solid growth in shipping unit volumes (up 191% as compared to the first quarter of 2016), and market-wide usage of MercadoEnvíos has reached 51% of total items sold. Our Classifieds business continues to experience growth, driven by demand from professional clients and maintaining its momentum in most countries. Live listings are at an all-time high of 3.8 million, growing 111% year-over-year. Professional clients are also at multi-year highs reaching almost 22 thousand sellers and growing 29% year-over-year. Our Net Promoter Score rose once again during the first quarter of 2017, providing our users consistently higher rates of immediate access to customer service representatives through real time online and phone channels.   First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights  Net revenues for the first quarter were $273.9 million, a year-over-year increase of 73.8% in USD and 78.9% on an FX neutral basis. Excluding Venezuela, net revenues grew 78.3% in USD and 61.4% in local currencies. Marketplace revenues grew 68.4% in USD, and 85.8% on an FX neutral basis, while non-marketplace revenues grew 81.8% in USD, and 68.4% on an FX neutral basis.  Gross profit for the first quarter of 2017 was $168.9 million. Gross profit margin was 61.6%, compared to 64.8% in the first quarter of 2016. Most of the margin compression is as the result of an increase in costs of providing free shipping in Mexico and incremental mPos adoption. Total operating expenses increased to $105.5 million, up 47.2% year-over-year. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 38.5% versus 45.5% in the first quarter of 2016.

Interest income grew 67.7% year-over-year to $12.2 million The company incurred $6.5 million dollars in financial expenses in the first quarter of 2017, mainly as a consequence of interest payments on its Convertible Bond issued in June 2014. Net income before taxes was $69.7 million, up 87.2% year-over-year. Income tax expense was $21.1 million during the first quarter, yielding a blended tax rate for the period of 30.4%, mainly due to higher share of pre-tax profits in Brazil. Net income as reported for the quarter was $48.5 million dollars, resulting in basic net income per share of 1 dollar and 10 cents. Net cash provided by operating activities was $104.8 million. Free cash flow, defined as cash from operating activities less payment for the acquisition of property, equipment, intangible assets, advances for property and equipment net of financial liabilities and payment for acquired businesses net of cash acquired, was $92.0 million. *   (*) See note on "Non-GAAP Financial Measures"

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018
