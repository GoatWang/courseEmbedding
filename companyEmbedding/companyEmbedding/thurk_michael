FC Heidenheim68(13)* Senior club appearances and goals counted for the domestic league only and correct as of 30 June 2014.Michael Thurk (born 28 May 1976 in Frankfurt) is a German footballer[1] who is currently a free agent.CareerThe offensive player Thurk went from Hessian Oberliga club SV Jügesheim to 1. FSV Mainz 05 in 1999[2] on advice of Django Mann who already connected a transfer of Abderrahim Ouakili.In 2005–06, Thurk marked 12 goals, being the third best player who would be eligible to play for Germany. Before the 2006–07 season, he moved to Eintracht Frankfurt, a transfer that is much disputed among Eintracht supporters because Thurk was a long term player for local rivals Mainz and a cult figure at the 05ers. In January 2008, he moved to FC Augsburg. In the 2009–10 season, Augsburg finished just short of promotion to the Bundesliga with Thurk being the league's top goalscorer. The following season Augsburg won promotion, with Thurk being suspended from the club shortly before the beginning of the 2011–12 season. He signed for 1. FC Heidenheim in January 2012. He left Heidenheim at the end of the 2013–14 season as his contract was not renewed.[3]After departing Heidenheim, Thurk was close to agreeing moves to India and the United States, namely Columbus Crew, but no transfer went through due to his injury problems.[4] A move to Gibraltarian club Europa also fell through in early 2015.[5]References^ "Thurk, Michael" (in German). kicker.de.

Kay F. Thurk, age 71, passed away peacefully at her home in Appleton on Friday, February 8, 2013. Kay was born on August 21, 1941, daughter of the late Francis "Mac" and Lida (Smits) McGinnis. She graduated from Appleton High School. Kay then continued her education as an X-ray technician and worked at St Elizabeth Hospital. 
Kay was an avid Chicago Bears fan and loved playing bingo. She also enjoyed working as a crossing guard and taking care of her dog, Murphy. Above all, she cherished the time spent with her children and family.
Kay is survived by three children: John (Hong) Thurk, Michael (Meredith) Thurk, Mary Frances (special friend, Brian Heintz), grandchildren, Isabella and Tianchi, who were the light of her life; and one sister, Patricia Maloney. She is further survived by her nephews Bill Maloney and his daughter Kelsey, Dan (Amy) Maloney and their children Jack, Charlie and Henry, and Joe (Christine) Maloney and their son Mac; special friends: Sharon (Joe) Rupiper, Elaine (Paul) Hemauer, Jane (Fritz) Jilek, Nicki (Bob) Mech, Joan Blatz and all of her co-workers at St. Elizabeth Hospital; grand dogs: Buddy, Taeger and Chester; and grand cats: Louise and Oliver; as well as other relatives and friends. 
The funeral liturgy for Kay will be held at 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, February 12, 2012, at ST. MARY CATHOLIC CHURCH (312 S. State Street) with Father Jim Leary, O.M.F. Cap. officiating. A time of visitation will be held on Monday, February 11, 2013, from 4:00 p.m. until the prayer service at 7:00 p.m. at the WICHMANN FUNERAL HOME DOWNTOWN (537 N. Superior St.) and again on Tuesday at the CHURCH from 10:00 until the time of mass. Online condolences may be expressed at www.wichmannfargo.com.
Kay's family would like to thank St. Pauls Hospice for all of their care and support.
