LeadershipWrittenStacy Brown-Philpot: Hire Leaders, Leave to Take RisksThe TaskRabbit CEO is used to being the first — and blazing a path for those who will follow.April 18, 2017|by

When Stacy Brown-Philpot took the helm in 2016 at TaskRabbit, the venture-backed online marketplace that matches freelance labor (called “taskers”) with local demand, she became the first black woman CEO of a tech company in Silicon Valley. At the time of the announcement, TaskRabbit founder and CEO Leah Busque said Brown-Philpot “is someone who knows how to scale and build the kind of strong partnerships we need to really grow.”

Brown-Philpot grew up in Detroit, studied her way into the Ivy League (The Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania) and did a turn in investment banking, where working on tech deals piqued her interest in the valley. She earned her MBA at Stanford in 2002, and by 2003 she had joined Google as a financial director. She then became a senior director of Google’s global consumer operations and an entrepreneur-in-residence at Google Ventures.
Along her paths, she focused on filling the pipeline with diverse candidates. She founded the Black Googler Network to attract, develop, and retain black talent at the company; she joined the board of HP Inc. at the invitation of Meg Whitman, whom she met at a party for women executives at Sheryl Sandberg’s house; and she’s on the board of Black Girls CODE, the nonprofit that draws girls of color to programming, engineering, app development, robotics, and other STEM fields.
Brown-Philpot spoke to Insights on her way home from the airport after a multi-day business trip to Chicago, pausing the conversation just long enough to greet an exuberant child screaming, “Mommy!” as she walked through the door.
How does your own sense of values manifest in your leadership style?
I think that many of my lessons have been around being authentic as a leader, being fully who I am as a person and allowing that authenticity to shape my leadership style. I was a different leader when I worked in India with Google. Earlier I joined companies that shared my values and now I get to shape a company that reflects my values. I’ve learned to connect the individual to the collective we are trying to create.
I value honesty and integrity, and character means everything to me. My favorite quote on this is from Martin Luther King Jr., who said, “The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” That is the true representation of a leader.
How is TaskRabbit a meaningful part of the sharing economy?
I like to focus on TaskRabbit as a job creator, a place and a platform for people to earn a living income and choosing a more flexible way to work to earn the money they need to achieve the life they want to have. Every day, I meet someone paying for their grandchild to go to college or saving money to go to school — there are a whole bunch of reasons, and we’re just creating everyday work for everyday people. Without the power of technology we wouldn’t have been able to create this platform for that to happen.
You’re coming up on a year as CEO. What’s gone right?
One of the things that’s gone right is we’ve doubled the size of the business by investing in the mobile product. We’re now half mobile, more than double than before. We took the experience and learned what the customer really wants and invested in the technology that really works for her. You can post a task in three clicks.

We’re hiring for leadership, and I want to know: Is that person going to be a strong person in my organization? Can they be thoughtful, can they take an idea and run with it and figure out how to make something happen?Stacy Brown-Philpot
At the end of the year we had an opportunity in the form of a partnership with IKEA; it launched in December 2016 in London. They really wanted to tackle the UK first and expand from there. You can add the service to your cart and have someone come and put your furniture together.
They came to us on a tour of Silicon Valley, and they were very interested in meeting with different interesting companies. We sat down with their group membership. We had already done thousands of IKEA furniture jobs and it helped them with their customer satisfaction. They realized we should work more closely together.
Looking at your career and your involvements — from being on the board of Black Girls CODE and launching the Black Googler Network — it’s clear that mentorship is an important part of what you do. How did being mentored play a role early in your career?
Early in my career, I wasn’t mentored. I grew up in Detroit and everybody who was successful there was a doctor or a lawyer. That’s why I spend a lot of time with women or girls who look like me, to say, “Here’s another choice that can be equally as interesting and important.” I had a lot of male mentors in my career, and then at Google I worked closely with Sheryl Sandberg, who was the first female mentor I had. There were people who helped push me and nudge me, and nobody told me about coding or tech when I was young enough to pursue it. That’s why I focus on young girls in school, to let them know it’s a valuable choice.
But you also didn’t start out in tech.
I was working in investment banking at Goldman Sachs and was excited about working on tech deals, with one company being sold and one going public and [I thought], “Wow, these companies are creating a lot of value.” That’s how I got fascinated by tech. And coming to Stanford Graduate School of Business was the perfect way to learn how Silicon Valley works and how tech companies are creating value and the meaning of entrepreneurship. It has the power to change lives further than you can imagine. At Stanford GSB, you feel it in the school but it’s also the essence of Silicon Valley. That’s when I decided I wanted to be a part of this work, and this is where I wanted to begin the next phase of my career.
That next phase took you to Google, where you had a long run as an executive before you decided to leave. How hard was that decision?
I like to think I had to break up with Google. It was a good boyfriend, but I felt like, “Can I be in this relationship forever?” I wanted to take risks and grow as a person. It wasn’t that such risks didn’t exist at Google, but they weren’t the ones that most excited me at the time. It was hard. I still miss a lot of what Google represents. I’m a huge fan.
How do you keep your physical and mental health strong?
I swim twice a week. I started swimming because my second pregnancy was very hard and my OB said, “Try swimming.” I wasn’t very good at it, but I got better and it’s very relaxing. We also have meditation time once a week at TaskRabbit — Thursday at 3 p.m. when I’m at the office I sit in a room and meditate with other people.
What kind of advice do you have for the MBAs coming up through Stanford GSB right now?
We’re hiring for leadership, and I want to know: Is that person going to be a strong person in my organization? Can they be thoughtful, can they take an idea and run with it and figure out how to make something happen? Are they good at leading others and managing? As a manager, my No. 1 job is to hire the best people and develop them. It’s really about the team and the people you build around you.
TaskRabbit is in 19 cities and in the UK and it’s a growing part of the sharing economy, but there’s been some unfortunate news recently about other companies in the space — specifically, the piece written by Susan Fowler, the former Uber engineer, about the harassment and discrimination she faced during her time there. What are your thoughts on what she wrote and how the company has responded?
I think the power of community is a real thing, and what Uber has built is a company powered by the people who make the business work — the drivers, riders, and people who participate in the sharing economy. These things have happened at other companies, and it almost never makes it to this level, but the expectations of companies that touch our lives are extremely high. We have a responsibility to take care of the people who work for us. I’m proud [Fowler] had the courage to say what she said and write what she wrote and that the community has supported her.

 Stacy Brown-Philpot Promoted to TaskRabbit CEO
Brown-Philpot ascends to a position that makes her one of the most powerful blacks and women in Silicon Valley.

Stacy Brown-Philpot, the COO of TaskRabbit, has been named CEO of the company, reports re/code.
[Related: THIS BLACK ENTREPRENEUR HAS “SECRET” FORMULA FOR WEALTH CREATION]
Brown-Philpot is taking over the position from current CEO and founder Leah Busque.
“Stacy is someone who knows how to scale and build the kind of strong partnerships we need to really grow,” Busque told re/code’s Kara Swisher.
In a statement to Black Enterprise, Brown-Philpot said, “I’m incredibly honored to be stepping into the CEO role at TaskRabbit.”
“I decided to join as COO three years ago and was inspired by how TaskRabbit was paving the way as a pioneer in the sharing economy. Looking to the future, TaskRabbit will change the face of how work gets done everyday, and I couldn’t be more excited to get started.”
Brown-Philpot stepped into the role as TaskRabbit COO in 2013. Prior, she had worked for nine years in various management roles at Google before taking a position as an entrepreneur-in-residence at Google Ventures in 2012.
She was the first COO for TaskRabbit, an online service matching freelancers to consumer demands such as handiwork, child and pet sitting, cleaning services, and more. TaskRabbit raised $38 million in five years.
She also served as Head of Online Sales and Operations for Google India, where she was in charge of remote sales and support for the company’s key customers.
Last year, Brown-Philpot was a highlight speaker at Black Enterprise’s inaugural TechConneXt summit. She spoke on a panel about ascending to the C-suite, executive career level.
On the panel, Brown-Philpot attributed much of her success to her willingness to move abroad and spoke of how beneficial her time in India was for her career.
“I got leadership opportunities that I wouldn’t have gotten had I stayed where I was,” she said at the event.
She also spoke about her mentors. She said at TechConneXt that Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg is an ongoing mentor. It was a relationship that she has built over the years from when she first interviewed for Google and Sandberg was then a VP. “For four and a half years we built a strong working relationship. I was a part of her staff as her . . . business partner,” she added.
“I was helping her solve problems. She started to trust me to make decisions on her behalf. I made good decisions and then I started making bigger decisions. She bought me in to manage a 200 person team. Eventually, I graduated from her and went out on my own, but I can still call her for advice.”
With the promotion to CEO, Brown-Philpot becomes one of the most powerful (and few) black executives in Silicon Valley and in the whole of the technology industry. She joins a rare group which includes Silicon Valley legend Ken Coleman, Lo Toney of Google Ventures, and David Drummond, Google’s lead counsel.

Quick ProfileName: Stacy Brown-Philpot Role: COO, TaskRabbitGrew up in: Detroit, Michigan Favorite Book(s): I don’t really have one. I like reading fiction. I believe that great leaders are great storytellers so reading fiction helps me improve my storytelling. Shantaram is a great read for this purpose.









How did you get into the world of technology?My path to technology really started when I decided to go to Stanford for business school. While at Goldman Sachs in 1999, I was fascinated by the valuation and excitement around the technology deals I worked on. My curiosity of what Silicon Valley was all about made the decision to go to Stanford very easy. While at Stanford, I was drawn to the pace, creativity, and innovation you find at tech firms.After spending a number of years in finance and accounting, I felt I had found the industry that truly excited me. People were building things that mattered and fundamentally changed the way we think, act, and do. With the choice of going into VC or operations, I chose operations. I wanted to build on the front lines and work alongside others to solve hard, challenging problems. Because of my finance background, it took a couple of steps for me to find a line role in a tech company. I wasn’t technical enough to be a product manager or engineer, so had to navigate the business side of technology.First, I worked in business development at a small startup call Wily Technology before joining Google in 2003. At Google, I started in finance and then later transitioned to sales operations where I spent the last decade of my career.



















Great mentors see potential AND give you the opportunity to realize it. They also give you the hard feedback when you screw up because they want you to be better.



















Who has been your most important professional mentor and why?Sheryl Sandberg (currently COO of Facebook). Great mentors see potential AND give you the opportunity to realize it. They also give you the hard feedback when you screw up because they want you to be better. I worked closely with Sheryl in finance at Google and she gave me the opportunity to step out of my comfort zone and into my first big operational role. It was in that role that I discovered my true passion for building, scaling and leading teams. I made a ton of mistakes along the way but her feedback helped me learn.What has been the most meaningful professional experience you’ve had and why?In 2009, I moved to Hyderabad, India to lead the online sales and operations team for Google. I had managed global teams already but living and conducting business in another country provided a rich cultural and professional experience that is unparalleled. I learned how to adapt my leadership style and truly immerse myself in the culture in order to be effective. I learned that with increasing responsibility there is increasing accountability and that working toward a common goal can yield amazing results. I now seek to find the uniqueness of every individual on my team and help him or her work toward realizing their full potential knowing that this is what will lead to our overall company success.What is the most difficult professional or personal challenge you’ve had to overcome?I made the decision to move to India without my husband, which was not very popular among my family and many friends because it seemed like I was choosing my career over my family. Chris did not feel that way and not only supported me but made sacrifices (read: long haul flights to India) to make sure that our relationship remained strong. I am very proud to say that we have now been married for 14 years, have a wonderful daughter and are still going strong.








				
				
					 
				
			
















Being who you are helps you align your values with those of your coworkers and the company. It is only then that optimal results are achieved.


















				
				
					 
				
			






What are three pieces of advice do you have for young people of color who are looking to get into technology?Take risks. You cannot succeed in tech if you are afraid to fail. The most successful leaders in technology started out doing the opposite of what everyone thinks they should do.Relationships matter. The tech industry moves fast and survives on the rapid exchange of information. Building your network and surrounding yourself with a diverse set of smart thinkers helps you make better, faster decisions.Be comfortable with YOU. My best employees bring their whole selves to work every day. Being who you are helps you align your values with those of your coworkers and the company. It is only then that optimal results are achieved.What are the three biggest lessons you’ve learned in going from a big company from Google to a smaller company like TaskRabbit?The pace is much faster. You often have to make decisions with a lot less certainty in a short amount of time. This is where intuition and judgment matters more than anything else.Learning to manage my emotional energy. At a startup, the highs are really high and the lows are really low. And as an executive your job is to absorb it all, celebrate successes, learn from failures, and keep the team moving forward.Everything still takes longer than you think and there are always surprises. It is expected at a big company that things take longer because of bureaucracy, politics, and other coordination costs. But things also take longer at startups because market dynamics change so fast and what you thought was the easiest path from point a to b suddenly becomes very difficult because new information was introduced. To manage this, I make sure I understand a) what is in my control and what is not and b) what are the biggest levers for our business so that when one of those is impacted I can react quickly.



















I would not be good at my job if there wasn’t alignment with who I am as a person.



















What advice do you have for people considering executive roles in startups?I always advise people considering a career move to choose to go to something not move away from what you are already doing. In the case of startups, go because you want that experience and not because you are not happy in your current role. At the executive level it is also important to align your personal values with that of the company and the founding team. I play a critical role in shaping the culture at TaskRabbit and ultimately our success. I would not be good at my job if there wasn’t alignment with who I am as a person. Finally, get ready to do the work. As an executive at a large company I could depend on my team for a lot. Now, I have to work alongside my team, roll up my sleeves, identify product bugs, talk to unhappy users, change the toilet paper in the bathroom, etc. It’s part of the experience and I love it!Who is one person you follow on social media who you think others should follow?Michelle Obama, role model and inspiration for all women.

Quick ProfileName: Stacy Brown-Philpot Role: COO, TaskRabbitGrew up in: Detroit, Michigan Favorite Book(s): I don’t really have one. I like reading fiction. I believe that great leaders are great storytellers so reading fiction helps me improve my storytelling. Shantaram is a great read for this purpose.









How did you get into the world of technology?My path to technology really started when I decided to go to Stanford for business school. While at Goldman Sachs in 1999, I was fascinated by the valuation and excitement around the technology deals I worked on. My curiosity of what Silicon Valley was all about made the decision to go to Stanford very easy.
