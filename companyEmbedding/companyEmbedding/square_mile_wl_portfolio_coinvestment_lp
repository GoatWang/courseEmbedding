Square Mile Capital Puts Final Piece in Place -- $68 Mezzanine Loan Facilitates Large Portfolio Recapitalization
October 15, 2012 - New York City, NY
Square Mile Capital Management LLC (“Square Mile”) today announced that it has originated a $68 million mezzanine loan on a 31-property, 4.5-million-square-foot office portfolio in Southern California.  Financial terms were not disclosed. The mezzanine loan was made to an ownership group that includes The Blackstone Group LP and a venture led by SL Green Realty Corp.  The SL Green-led venture assumed ownership of the portfolio in lieu of foreclosure in July 2012, and then recapitalized the portfolio by forming a joint venture with Blackstone, as announced earlier this week.  Proceeds of the mezzanine loan are being used to recapitalize the portfolio as part of New York Life Insurance Company, Dekabank Deutsche Girozentrale, Münchener Hypothekenbank EG, Westdeutsche Immobilienbank AG, and Wells Fargo’s extension and modification of the $678.8 million senior financing on the portfolio.   The portfolio is comprised of 59 buildings in all, located in various Los Angeles, Orange County and San Diego submarkets.  It includes assets such as the LA Corporate Center in LA North, Skyview Center in the LAX submarket, 350 S. Beverly Drive in Beverly Hills and Carmel Valley Center in San Diego’s Del Mar Heights. Square Mile’s loan origination is consistent with the firm’s focus as an opportunistic real estate investor with a recognized specialty in distressed and high-yield debt, recapitalizations and undervalued equity situations.  In partnership with USAA Real Estate Company, Square Mile originated and structured the loan, which is the firm’s inaugural investment in the mezzanine origination marketplace as Square Mile moves to establish and grow its subordinate debt origination platform.  Launched in 2006 by industry veterans Craig H. Solomon and Jeffrey B. Citrin, Square Mile has deployed nearly $2 billion of equity since inception.  About Square Mile Capital Management LLCSquare Mile Capital Management LLC is a private investment firm based in New York that focuses on real estate and real estate-related opportunities, including both debt and equity investments on behalf of select institutional and private investors.  The firm takes a value-oriented approach to its investment activities, with an emphasis on opportunities to acquire or capitalize assets or enterprises that are undervalued, overlooked, complex or mispriced.  Since inception, Square Mile has formed three discretionary real estate funds and has invested nearly $2 billion of equity in more than 80 distinct investments.

Our Story



Square Mile is an independent investment research business that works in partnership with regulated professional financial services  firms. We help advisers to develop informed investment recommendations so that, with their support, their clients can make the decisions that are right for them.
Focusing first and foremost on in-depth, qualitative fund research, we provide tailored support and investment services for financial advisers and institutions.
For us there is only one way to deliver rigorous and insightful qualitative research and that is to invest in professional, qualified and experienced people. For this reason alone we have built one of the strongest and most respected qualitative investment research teams in the UK. Our analysts focus on investment research and meet regularly with fund managers to understand how those managers work, how they think and how they react to markets. We listen, we observe, we test, we challenge, we discuss, we deliberate and we form opinions. Finally, we publish our research and our views. These are based on clearly articulated outcomes and objectives, from which adviser firms can identify suitable funds to meet the needs of their clients.
The result of this work we hope is evident in our Academy of Funds. The Academy is free to access for adviser firms and if you have not yet registered we would invite you to do so by clicking here.

Real estate managers' co-investments no comfort to investors - Pensions & Investments

























































































































































































            No consolation
        
Real estate managers’ co-investments no comfort to investors
 



      By Arleen Jacobius
 · January 24, 2011



Real estate managers have been sampling their own cooking for decades, but that didn't make losses among the largest co-investments any more palatable to outside investors after the economic meltdown of 2008-"09. Indeed, investment strategies of some large real estate managers that had made sizable investments alongside their investors suffered some of the worst returns, industry insiders say. This is prompting consultants and investors to reconsider whether real estate co-investment truly ensures the fortunes of managers and their investors rise and fall together.

Some real estate managers fared well — because of the fees they collected — even as the investment portfolios performed poorly. And some of the portfolio managers, who did not have any personal investment in the funds, are leaving firms in pursuit of new opportunities, industry insiders say, although no one would name names. The result is that co-investment funds are being structured very differently. Large institutional investors are revisiting the issue of alignment of interests and changing the way they invest in real estate. The $140.1 billion California State Teachers' Retirement System, West Sacramento, looked at the issue of alignment of interests as part of a review of its real estate investment policy. “The overall decision was a move to more core investments, to deleverage the portfolio and, in terms of alignment of interest, to choose partners that have large ownership interests in the investments pitched and structure agreements with alignment in mind,” Ricardo Duran, spokesman, said in an e-mailed response to questions. He said CalSTRS executives have not seen a relationship between co-investment and investment manager performance to “any significant degree.” “CalSTRS is looking for partnerships that provide for liquidity through redemption and termination provisions that benefit investors, and provide management accountability through greater disclosure,” he said. When asked whether co-investments can align general partner and limited partner interests, Mr. Duran stated: “Yes, they can be, provided the documents are negotiated properly with that in mind.”



Meaningful co-investment
Mark A. Grinis, global real estate investment funds leader at 
Ernst & Young LLC, New York, agreed: “The principle is that the co-investment has got to mean something to the general partner.” If a small, four-person investment group makes a 2% co-investment in a $400 million fund, that is going to mean a lot more than if a big investment bank invests a similar percentage in its real estate investment subsidiary's fund, he explained. “I think the lesson learned is investors are looking for the key principals to have material skin in the game,” Mr. Grinis said. Across the real estate investment business, many real estate managers are making pre-emptive changes to funds to make the co-investments more attractive. Many new funds are pooling returns so managers no longer are able to extract their returns on a deal-by-deal basis. Instead, profits are pooled and everyone — managers and investors — waits until the fund is liquidated before they can share in the profits and fees, Mr. Grinis explained. What's more, management fees in the new funds are substantially lower and are based on the committed capital, so investment managers can no longer make money in fees whether the properties make money or not. Large co-investments provide little guarantee of returns. 

Morgan Stanley (MS) Real Estate funds include a 10% capital commitment, which was called for Funds V and VI, sources told Pensions & Investments.Through March 31, 2010, 
Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund V International LP has returned -2.9% since inception in October 2005 and 
Morgan Stanley Real Estate VI International LP returned -84.2%, since its July 2007 inception, according to CalSTRS' latest semiannual real estate report. “What helps us sleep at night is the notion that whatever happens to us will happen to the manager,” said Marc Weidner, New York-based managing director of real estate fund-of-funds manager 
Franklin 
Templeton (BEN) Real Estate Advisors. “But it's a mirage.” Some of the real estate managers structured their fee arrangements so any losses from their co-investments were relatively modest when compared to the asset management and other fees those managers received, he said. Wall Street investment firms with real estate management subsidiaries created the strategy of co-investing to coax wary investors into real estate portfolios the firms had bought through the Resolution Trust Corp., a federal program begun in 1989 to liquidate assets held by insolvent savings and loans. The idea of shared risk with managers gave investors comfort and worked to draw them into these investments, explained Ted Leary, president of consultant Crosswater Realty Advisors, Los Angeles. Now, co-investment is de rigueur in the industry. “It makes everybody feel better if the general partner loses money alongside the limited partner,” Mr. Leary said in an interview. In a letter this month to clients and colleagues, Mr. Leary wrote, “I continue to see no demonstrable evidence that manager co-investment makes a manager a better investor. In fact, some of the most dramatic loss situations I dealt with involved very significant co-investment by the manager. On the other hand, several of the most successful programs I observed had minimal manager co-investment.” Some managers have defaulted on their co-investment, consultants say, although none would name names. “Some managers overstretched because they bought the dream that they were selling,” 
Franklin 
Templeton's Mr. Weidner said. He would not identify any firms. Still, not all of the big managers that made large co-investments suffered lousy returns. Many held their own, even during the latest financial crisis. Warburg Pincus LLC, Madison Capital Partners and Square Mile Capital LLC all managed to return investors' capital plus some profits, insiders said. Alignment of interests is serious business to investors. Last August, CalSTRS bought out its partners' 10% interest in four joint ventures it entered into in 2005 with First Industrial Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust. “The move was done to achieve full control of the properties because CalSTRS felt there was not a full alignment of interest between partners,” Mr. Duran told P&I at the time.Most institutional investors are reviewing their real estate investment strategies and how they invest in the asset class, but few are jettisoning their co-investment requirements. “I must admit I have not won this argument with my clients and certainly not with the consultant community,” Crosswater's Mr. Leary said.Making changes

Ernst & Young's Mr. Grinis said real estate investment managers already are making changes. Even existing funds are getting restructured to make sure interests are more aligned with investors' interests. In essence, managers of these newly realigned funds are getting paid at the end, rather than reaping fees during the life of the fund, whether the fund makes money or not. Mr. Grinis declined to name any examples. Paul Greenwood, managing director of Northern Lights Capital Group LLC, a private equity firm that invests in asset management firms, said, “Alignment of interest ... is crucial to the long-term success and the success in providing clients with a consistently good product.” But achieving it varies with each investment, he said. “If I'm a start-up investment manager with no personal wealth beyond what I've invested in my firm, I might have a good case for a tight alignment with my investors,” Mr. Greenwood said. “If I'm worth $100 million and I've invested $1 million in the fund, I may have alignment with my investors, maybe or maybe not.” Glenn Shannon, president of San Francisco-based Shorenstein Realty Services LP, agrees that co-investment is not a quick fix that automatically aligns manager and investor interests. Shorenstein has committed $500 million of the $5.4 billion raised in its nine funds since 1992, but alignment of interests is more than making a co-investment, he said. “Investors should also focus on whether the structure of the investment vehicle, in terms of duration and fees, promotes the investment expertise of the sponsor, and the personnel and financial resources of the sponsor are all aligned with the investment strategy of the fund,” Mr. Shannon said.
