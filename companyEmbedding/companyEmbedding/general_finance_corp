General Finance Corporation







 
        ASIA - PACIFIC
Royal 
        Wolf (ASX:RWH) leases and sells mobile storage containers, portable 
        container buildings and freight containers in Australia and New Zealand. 
        They currently operate 28 customer service centers in Australia and New 
        Zealand. Royal Wolf is the only portable container lease and sales company 
        represented in all major business centers in Australia and, as such, is 
        the only company with a nationally integrated infrastructure and work 
        force. They serve both small to mid-size retail customers and large corporate 
        customers in a number of sectors.

      Royal Wolf products include the following:

Mobile Storage Containers 
      for on-site storage by retail outlets and manufacturers, local councils 
      and government departments, farming and agricultural concerns, building 
      and construction companies, clubs and sporting associations, mine operators 
      and individual customers. Mobile storage products include general purpose-dry 
      storage containers, refrigerated containers and hazardous goods containers 
      in a range of standard and modified sizes, designs and storage capacities.
Portable Container Buildings for use as 
        site offices, housing accommodations and for other purposes. We entered 
        the portable building market in August 2005 with 20' and 40' portable 
        buildings manufactured from steel container platforms which are marketed 
        primarily to mine operators, construction companies and the general public.

Freight Containers specifically designed 
        for transport of products by road and rail. Customers include national 
        moving and storage companies, distribution and logistics companies, domestic 
        freight forwarders, transport companies, rail freight operators and the 
        Australian military. Freight container products include curtain-side, 
        refrigerated and bulk cargo containers, together with a range of standard 
        and industry-specific dry freight containers.

NORTH AMERICA
Pac-Van 
        leases and sells modular buildings, mobile offices, portable storage containers 
        and related ancillary services in the United States. We operate twenty-eight 
        (28) branch locations across eighteen (18) states and one province of 
        Canada. The following is a description of our products:
Modular 
        Buildings - Also known as manufactured buildings, modular buildings 
        provide customers with additional space and are often tailored to satisfy 
        unique customer needs. Depending on the customer's desired application, 
        modular buildings generally consist of two or more floors and can range 
        in size from 1,000 to more than 30,000 square feet and may be highly customized.

Mobile Offices - Also known as trailers 
        or construction trailers, mobile offices are re-locatable units with aluminum 
        or wood exteriors on wood frames on a steel carriage fitted with axles, 
        allowing for an assortment of "add-ons" to provide comfortable 
        and convenient temporary space solutions.
Storage Containers - We lease storage containers 
        to a wide variety of customers across the United States and Canada. Storage 
        containers provide a flexible, low cost alternative to warehousing, while 
        offering greater security, convenience, and immediate accessibility. Most 
        units are ventilated and secured with cam-locking doors, steel walls and 
        roofs. We also offer storage vans, also known as storage trailers or dock-height 
        trailers. 
Office Containers - Or Ground Level Offices 
        (GLO), are converted shipping containers that are re-manufactured into 
        mobile offices; and in-plant units, which are manufactured structures 
        that provide self-contained office space with maximum design flexibility.

Portable Liquid Storage Tank Containers 
        - Portable liquid storage tank containers are often referred to as "frac 
        tanks" or "frac tank containers" and are manufactured steel 
        containers with fixed steel axles for transport and use in a variety of 
        industries; including oil and gas exploration and field services, refinery, 
        chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and 
        field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, 
        pipeline construction and maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater 
        treatment and waste management and landfill services. While there are 
        a number of different sizes of tanks currently used in the market place, 
        we currently focus on the more common 500-barrel capacity containers.


Lone 
        Star leases portable liquid storage tank containers, oil test tanks, 
        acid tanks, related fluid management equipment and containment products, 
        as well as provides certain fluid management services, to the oil and 
        gas industry in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins of Texas.


  


 Southern 
            Frac manufactures portable liquid storage tank containers from 
            its facility in Waxahachie, Texas. Southern Frac's products consist 
            of V-bottom and round bottom frac tanks, as well as open top mud tanks, 
            acid tanks and vacuum tank trailers. In addition, Southern Frac offers other 
high-quality steel-based products, including container chassis and certified storm shelters, 
under the trade name Southern Fabrication Specialties.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
