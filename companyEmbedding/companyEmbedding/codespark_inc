Privacy Policy







At codeSpark we care very much about your privacy. As creators of apps for children, we follow the best practices as specified by the “Know what’s inside” program and aim to comply with The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We strive to be upfront about what our Apps contain, so there are no hidden surprises. This Privacy Policy describes the ways in which codespark. Inc. (collectively, “Company” or “We”) collects, uses and discloses information about you and the children who use the websites, applications (“Apps”) and online products and services that link to this policy (collectively, the “Services”). By using the Services you agree to the handling of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
A few key points upfront:
The Services do not include any pop up ads or other third party advertisements.
During registration the only information we may ask you to provide about a child who will be using the Services is the child’s first name.
Other than the fees for purchasing a subscription for the Services, where applicable, there are no in app purchases.
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT
Automatic Collection: Like most digital companies, we may use common technologies such as cookies and other technologies to better understand users’ interactions with our games, websites and other services (the “Services”). These technologies help us keep track of user behavior, tell us which parts of our Services people have visited and are using, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of activities. If you use any of our Services, we may also collect data related to the device on which the App is loaded. In particular, We are using third party services called Mixpanel and Google Analytics.  They store this data securely and do not share it with anyone else.  We are using the restricted version of their analytics product designed specifically for use with apps for children, meaning that the anonymous data created from our Apps isn’t used anywhere else in their system, it’s only for us to improve the apps, including information on App crashes, usage time, games played and problems missed.
Volunteered: If you (parents and teachers) create an account, register with us, send us an email, or provide other personally identifiable information with us in any other way, we will collect and store the information you share. You do not have to share this information with us, but without, it you may not be able to access certain features or participate in certain aspects of the Services.
The Services may enable you to input (first) names for multiple players, which allow you to set up multiple profiles on a single device. The Apps will track each child’s play data separately to provide personalized activities and levels for each profile. Only parents or educators may sign up for a parent or school account by entering through a parental gate. When you sign up for a parent account, we collect and verify the parent’s email address. With such an account, we provide to you additional services, such as multiple profiles, your child’s progress reports and additional resources. The Profile Names, along with birth month and year, will be collected in order to personalize your reports.
For school accounts and school-based services, a school administrator or educator signs up for a school account, whereupon we collect the administrator’s or educator’s name, email address, school name and city. An educator sets up student nicknames or first names and accessibility options. The Services will collect student play data thru persistent identifiers. This allows us to provide progress reports. All information collected from our Services are for internal purposes to provide and improve Services and for use and benefit of the students, schools and parents only. As permitted by FTC’s guidelines of COPPA, we rely on teachers and schools to obtain parental consents if and when they are necessary.
Publicly Posted: If you post information on public areas of the Site (i.e. comments or blog), that information is visible to and may be collected, stored and used by anyone. We recommend you be cautious about giving out personally identifiable information to others or sharing personally identifiable information in public or online forums. We are not responsible for the actions of any third parties with whom you share personally identifiable information.
Credit Cards. You can become a subscriber by purchasing a subscription to the Services within the Apps, where allowed by the App marketplace partners. When You subscribe to our Services, the order process may request a credit card or other payment information (i.e. PayPal). Order information is done through the itunes and Android App Stores directly so Your credit card information is not collected or retained by Us.
 
HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?
In general, we collect and use Information to provide the Services, to provide support for the Services, to respond to user requests and inquiries, to maintain a record of our dealings with users, to facilitate your use of and our administration and operation of the Services; and to improve our offerings.
WHEN DO WE SHARE OR DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION?

Anonymous Information. Anonymous information is information that does not identify you personally, like usage and metrics information, referring website addresses, and “aggregate” information. Anonymous information helps us understand trends and user needs so that we can better design new products and services and refine existing products and services to serve our customers better. We may share anonymous information with others, including developers, potential investors, marketers, and business partners.
Personally identifiable information is individually identifiable information, such as an individual’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other information. Personally identifiable information also includes demographic information, date of birth, gender, geographic area and preferences and when such information is linked to other personal information that identifies an individual.

All Information (Both Anonymous and Personally Identifiable). In certain circumstances, we may share any or all information we have collected, including personally identifiable information. For example:

9.3. You are responsible for being informed about and complying with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to your use of the Services.

9.6. You cannot assign the Agreement without the written agreement. We can assign the agreement to any entity that agrees to be bound by the terms of the Agreement.
9.7. The Agreement is governed by California law, excluding its choice of laws principles. The exclusive venue for any litigation arising from or related to the Services shall be the courts of Los Angeles County, California, except for any optional arbitration as described next. Excluding claims for equitable relief, if the total amount in dispute is less than $5,000, either party may elect to resolve the claim through binding arbitration by initiating arbitration through an established provider that is agreed by the parties.
