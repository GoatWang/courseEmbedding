About | Qualcomm










Inventors. Dreamers. Doers.Who We AreLeadershipHistoryAwardsBillions, maybe trillions of times a day…
We often do what many thought was impossible. 
That’s how often people around the world touch something made better by Qualcomm. It could be the smartphone in your pocket, the tablet on your coffee table, that wireless modem in your briefcase… it could even be that navigation system in your car or that action camera strapped to your chest.
Who is Qualcomm, and what do we do? We are engineers, scientists and business strategists. We are from many different countries and speak many different languages. We come from diverse cultures and have unique perspectives. Together, we focus on a single goal—invent mobile technology breakthroughs.
 
Invention at QualcommInvention is at the heart of human progress, at the heart of the mobile industry, and both are at the heart of our business.
Stories of InventionStories of Qualcomm inventions accelerating human potential, improving the way we live, work, learn, and play.
Qualcomm ResearchQualcomm Research has been making history for nearly three decades. The secret? Unrelenting focus on the future.
"We’re fascinated by technology and always working to push it forward. Our job is to be impatient. That’s our role in the mobile industry, and our future.”
Steve Mollenkopf, CEO
See leadershipPioneers, risk takers.
While many of our inventions and breakthroughs reside “under the hood” of consumer electronics, they have transformed the world in a big way. They have helped propel mobile to the forefront of the technology world and to the top of consumers’ wish lists. They have created new opportunities for mobile ecosystem players—the wireless device makers, the operators, the developers and the content creators of the world. And more recently, our inventions and breakthroughs have inspired fresh, new ideas from those companies—large and small—new to the wireless space.
We’ve been called dreamers, inventors, rebels, risk takers, pioneers and geeks. We embrace those labels because in many ways, they’re true. We dream big. We invent bigger. And most importantly, we often do what many thought was impossible.
LeadershipOur executive team is comprised of the top thought leaders and visionaries in the industry.
HistoryFrom CDMA in 1989 to LTE today, our fingerprint is on the history of the mobile industry.
AwardsQualcomm has earned a distinguished reputation that goes beyond CDMA.

Apple's stock set up for 10th straight gain 
Apple Inc.'s stock  edged up 0.2% in premarket trade Thursday, which sets it up to post a 10th straight gain. The technology giant's stock has had a 10-session win streak since the 10-day stretch ending Oct. 18, 2010. Qualcomm Inc.  commentary late-Wednesday while reporting quarterly results suggests the chip maker's patent dispute with Apple wasn't likely to reach a settlement for at least a year, according to BMO Capital analyst Tim Long. Apple's win streak comes as the Nasdaq 100  is also on track to post a 10th straight gain to another record, with e-mini Nasdaq 100 futures up 0.1% ahead of the open. Apple's stock has rallied 30.4% year to date through Wednesday, while the Nasdaq 100 has run up 21.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average  has climbed 9.5%.

Qualcomm forecast disappoints amid Apple fight
Qualcomm Inc.  met expectations with its quarterly earnings report Wednesday, but shares fell as the company's forecast excluded any sales related to Apple Inc.  products and came in less than expected amid a legal battle with the iPhone maker. Qualcomm reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $866 million, or 58 cents a share, on revenue of $5.37 billion. Qualcomm was expected on average to report adjusted earnings of 83 cents a share on revenue of $5.28 billion, according to a FactSet analyst survey. Qualcomm's forecast was more highly anticipated, however, amid a big fight between Qualcomm and Apple over the licensing fees Qualcomm commands for its patented technologies, but Qualcomm did not include licensing fees in its forecast. "Our financial guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 excludes QTL revenues related to the sale of Apple products by Apple's contract manufacturers as well as the other licensee in dispute as we expect the recent actions taken by these licensees will continue until the respective disputes are resolved," the company said in its release. Qualcomm predicted adjusted earnings of 75 cents to 85 cents 
a share on sales of $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion. Analysts on average expected the fourth-quarter forecast to call for adjusted earnings per share of 93 cents on revenue of $5.51 billion, according to FactSet. Qualcomm shares dipped about 3% in late trading after the report was released, following a 0.9% gain in regular trading.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
