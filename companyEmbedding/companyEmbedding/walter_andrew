Walter Andrew Shewhart (pronounced like "shoe-heart", March 18, 1891 – March 11, 1967) was an American physicist, engineer and statistician, sometimes known as the father of statistical quality control and also related to the Shewhart cycle.
W. Edwards Deming said of him:

As a statistician, he was, like so many of the rest of us, self-taught, on a good background of physics and mathematics.[citation needed]

Born in New Canton, Illinois to Anton and Esta Barney Shewhart, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign before being awarded his doctorate in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1917. He married Edna Elizabeth Hart, daughter of William Nathaniel and Isabelle "Ibie" Lippencott Hart on August 4, 1914 in Pike County, Illinois.

Work on industrial quality[edit]
Bell Telephone’s engineers had been working to improve the reliability of their transmission systems. In order to impress government regulators of this natural monopoly with the high quality of their service, Shewhart's first assignment was to improve the voice clarity of the carbon transmitters in the company's telephone handsets. Later he applied his statistical methods to the final installation of central station switching systems, then to factory production. When Dr. Shewhart joined the Western Electric Company Inspection Engineering Department at the Hawthorne Works in 1918, industrial quality was limited to inspecting finished products and removing defective items. That all changed on May 16, 1924. Dr. Shewhart's boss, George D. Edwards, recalled: "Dr. Shewhart prepared a little memorandum only about a page in length. About a third of that page was given over to a simple diagram which we would all recognize today as a schematic control chart. That diagram, and the short text which preceded and followed it, set forth all of the essential principles and considerations which are involved in what we know today as process quality control."[1] Shewhart's work pointed out the importance of reducing variation in a manufacturing process and the understanding that continual process-adjustment in reaction to non-conformance actually increased variation and degraded quality.
Shewhart framed the problem in terms of assignable-cause and chance-cause variation and introduced the control chart as a tool for distinguishing between the two. Shewhart stressed that bringing a production process into a state of statistical control, where there is only chance-cause variation, and keeping it in control, is necessary to predict future output and to manage a process economically. Dr. Shewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of statistical control by carefully designed experiments. While Dr. Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he understood data from physical processes never produce a "normal distribution curve" (a Gaussian distribution, also commonly called a "bell curve"). He discovered that observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature (Brownian motion of particles). Dr. Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process, while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times.[2]
Shewhart worked to advance the thinking at Bell Telephone Laboratories from their foundation in 1925 until his retirement in 1956, publishing a series of papers in the Bell System Technical Journal.
His work was summarized in his book Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product (1931).
Shewhart’s charts were adopted by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in 1933 and advocated to improve production during World War II in American War Standards Z1.1-1941, Z1.2-1941 and Z1.3-1942.
Later work[edit]
From the late 1930s onwards, Shewhart's interests expanded out from industrial quality to wider concerns in science and statistical inference. The title of his second book, Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control (1939), asks the audacious question: "What can statistical practice, and science in general, learn from the experience of industrial quality control?"
Shewhart's approach to statistics was radically different from that of many of his contemporaries. He possessed a strong operationalist outlook, largely absorbed from the writings of pragmatist philosopher Clarence Irving Lewis, and this influenced his statistical practice. In particular, he had read Lewis' Mind and the World Order many times. Though he lectured in England in 1932 under the sponsorship of Karl Pearson (another committed operationalist) his ideas attracted little enthusiasm within the English statistical tradition. The British Standards nominally based on his work, in fact, diverge on serious philosophical and methodological issues from his practice.
His more conventional work led him to formulate the statistical idea of tolerance intervals and to propose his data presentation rules, which are listed below:

Data have no meaning apart from their context.
Data contain both signal and noise. To be able to extract information, one must separate the signal from the noise within the data.

Walter Shewhart visited India in 1947–1948 under the sponsorship of P. C. Mahalanobis of the Indian Statistical Institute. He toured the country, held conferences and stimulated interest in statistical quality control among Indian industrialists.[3]
He died at Troy Hills, New Jersey in 1967.
Influence[edit]
In 1938 his work came to the attention of physicists W. Edwards Deming and Raymond T. Birge. The two had been deeply intrigued by the issue of measurement error in science and had published a landmark paper in Reviews of Modern Physics in 1934. On reading of Shewhart's insights, they wrote to the journal to wholly recast their approach in the terms that Shewhart advocated.
The encounter began a long collaboration between Shewhart and Deming that involved work on productivity during World War II and Deming's championing of Shewhart's ideas in Japan from 1950 onwards. Deming developed some of Shewhart's methodological proposals around scientific inference and named his synthesis the Shewhart cycle.
To celebrate his quasquicentennial (125th) birth Anniversary, the Quality Technology and Quantitative Management[4] (QTQM) (ISSN 1684-3703) journal plans to produce a special issue in early 2017 on "Advances in the Theory and Application of Statistical Process Control".[5] The special issue will be edited by Prof. Min Xie of City University of Hong Kong and Dr. Amitava Mukherjee of XLRI - Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur, India.
Achievements and honours[edit]
In his obituary for the American Statistical Association, Deming wrote of Shewhart:

As a man, he was gentle, genteel, never ruffled, never off his dignity. He knew disappointment and frustration, through failure of many writers in mathematical statistics to understand his point of view.

He was founding editor of the Wiley Series in Mathematical Statistics, a role that he maintained for twenty years, always championing freedom of speech and confident to publish views at variance with his own.
His honours included:

Founding member, fellow and president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics;
Founding member, first honorary member and first Shewhart Medalist of the American Society for Quality;
Fellow and President of the American Statistical Association;
Fellow of the International Statistical Institute;
Honorary fellow of the Royal Statistical Society;
Holley medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers;
Honorary Doctor of Science, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta.

In 1938 his work came to the attention of physicists W. Edwards Deming and Raymond T. Birge. The two had been deeply intrigued by the issue of measurement error in science and had published a landmark paper in Reviews of Modern Physics in 1934. On reading of Shewhart's insights, they wrote to the journal to wholly recast their approach in the terms that Shewhart advocated.
The encounter began a long collaboration between Shewhart and Deming that involved work on productivity during World War II and Deming's championing of Shewhart's ideas in Japan from 1950 onwards. Deming developed some of Shewhart's methodological proposals around scientific inference and named his synthesis the Shewhart cycle.
To celebrate his quasquicentennial (125th) birth Anniversary, the Quality Technology and Quantitative Management[4] (QTQM) (ISSN 1684-3703) journal plans to produce a special issue in early 2017 on "Advances in the Theory and Application of Statistical Process Control".[5] The special issue will be edited by Prof. Min Xie of City University of Hong Kong and Dr. Amitava Mukherjee of XLRI - Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur, India.
Achievements and honours[edit]
In his obituary for the American Statistical Association, Deming wrote of Shewhart:

As a man, he was gentle, genteel, never ruffled, never off his dignity. He knew disappointment and frustration, through failure of many writers in mathematical statistics to understand his point of view.

He was founding editor of the Wiley Series in Mathematical Statistics, a role that he maintained for twenty years, always championing freedom of speech and confident to publish views at variance with his own.
His honours included:

Founding member, fellow and president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics;
Founding member, first honorary member and first Shewhart Medalist of the American Society for Quality;
Fellow and President of the American Statistical Association;
Fellow of the International Statistical Institute;
Honorary fellow of the Royal Statistical Society;
Holley medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers;
Honorary Doctor of Science, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta.

Walter Andrew Shewhart (pronounced like "shoe-heart", March 18, 1891 – March 11, 1967) was an American physicist, engineer and statistician, sometimes known as the father of statistical quality control and also related to the Shewhart cycle.
W. Edwards Deming said of him:

As a statistician, he was, like so many of the rest of us, self-taught, on a good background of physics and mathematics.[citation needed]

Born in New Canton, Illinois to Anton and Esta Barney Shewhart, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign before being awarded his doctorate in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1917. He married Edna Elizabeth Hart, daughter of William Nathaniel and Isabelle "Ibie" Lippencott Hart on August 4, 1914 in Pike County, Illinois.

Work on industrial quality[edit]
Bell Telephone’s engineers had been working to improve the reliability of their transmission systems. In order to impress government regulators of this natural monopoly with the high quality of their service, Shewhart's first assignment was to improve the voice clarity of the carbon transmitters in the company's telephone handsets. Later he applied his statistical methods to the final installation of central station switching systems, then to factory production. When Dr. Shewhart joined the Western Electric Company Inspection Engineering Department at the Hawthorne Works in 1918, industrial quality was limited to inspecting finished products and removing defective items. That all changed on May 16, 1924. Dr. Shewhart's boss, George D. Edwards, recalled: "Dr. Shewhart prepared a little memorandum only about a page in length. About a third of that page was given over to a simple diagram which we would all recognize today as a schematic control chart. That diagram, and the short text which preceded and followed it, set forth all of the essential principles and considerations which are involved in what we know today as process quality control."[1] Shewhart's work pointed out the importance of reducing variation in a manufacturing process and the understanding that continual process-adjustment in reaction to non-conformance actually increased variation and degraded quality.
Shewhart framed the problem in terms of assignable-cause and chance-cause variation and introduced the control chart as a tool for distinguishing between the two. Shewhart stressed that bringing a production process into a state of statistical control, where there is only chance-cause variation, and keeping it in control, is necessary to predict future output and to manage a process economically. Dr. Shewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of statistical control by carefully designed experiments. While Dr. Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he understood data from physical processes never produce a "normal distribution curve" (a Gaussian distribution, also commonly called a "bell curve"). He discovered that observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature (Brownian motion of particles). Dr. Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process, while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times.[2]
Shewhart worked to advance the thinking at Bell Telephone Laboratories from their foundation in 1925 until his retirement in 1956, publishing a series of papers in the Bell System Technical Journal.
His work was summarized in his book Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product (1931).
Shewhart’s charts were adopted by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in 1933 and advocated to improve production during World War II in American War Standards Z1.1-1941, Z1.2-1941 and Z1.3-1942.
Later work[edit]
From the late 1930s onwards, Shewhart's interests expanded out from industrial quality to wider concerns in science and statistical inference. The title of his second book, Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control (1939), asks the audacious question: "What can statistical practice, and science in general, learn from the experience of industrial quality control?"
Shewhart's approach to statistics was radically different from that of many of his contemporaries. He possessed a strong operationalist outlook, largely absorbed from the writings of pragmatist philosopher Clarence Irving Lewis, and this influenced his statistical practice. In particular, he had read Lewis' Mind and the World Order many times. Though he lectured in England in 1932 under the sponsorship of Karl Pearson (another committed operationalist) his ideas attracted little enthusiasm within the English statistical tradition. The British Standards nominally based on his work, in fact, diverge on serious philosophical and methodological issues from his practice.
His more conventional work led him to formulate the statistical idea of tolerance intervals and to propose his data presentation rules, which are listed below:

Data have no meaning apart from their context.
Data contain both signal and noise. To be able to extract information, one must separate the signal from the noise within the data.

Walter Shewhart visited India in 1947–1948 under the sponsorship of P. C. Mahalanobis of the Indian Statistical Institute. He toured the country, held conferences and stimulated interest in statistical quality control among Indian industrialists.[3]
He died at Troy Hills, New Jersey in 1967.
Influence[edit]
In 1938 his work came to the attention of physicists W. Edwards Deming and Raymond T. Birge. The two had been deeply intrigued by the issue of measurement error in science and had published a landmark paper in Reviews of Modern Physics in 1934. On reading of Shewhart's insights, they wrote to the journal to wholly recast their approach in the terms that Shewhart advocated.

Walter Andrew Shewhart (pronounced like "shoe-heart", March 18, 1891 – March 11, 1967) was an American physicist, engineer and statistician, sometimes known as the father of statistical quality control and also related to the Shewhart cycle.
W. Edwards Deming said of him:

As a statistician, he was, like so many of the rest of us, self-taught, on a good background of physics and mathematics.[citation needed]

Born in New Canton, Illinois to Anton and Esta Barney Shewhart, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign before being awarded his doctorate in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1917. He married Edna Elizabeth Hart, daughter of William Nathaniel and Isabelle "Ibie" Lippencott Hart on August 4, 1914 in Pike County, Illinois.

Work on industrial quality[edit]
Bell Telephone’s engineers had been working to improve the reliability of their transmission systems. In order to impress government regulators of this natural monopoly with the high quality of their service, Shewhart's first assignment was to improve the voice clarity of the carbon transmitters in the company's telephone handsets. Later he applied his statistical methods to the final installation of central station switching systems, then to factory production. When Dr. Shewhart joined the Western Electric Company Inspection Engineering Department at the Hawthorne Works in 1918, industrial quality was limited to inspecting finished products and removing defective items. That all changed on May 16, 1924. Dr. Shewhart's boss, George D. Edwards, recalled: "Dr. Shewhart prepared a little memorandum only about a page in length. About a third of that page was given over to a simple diagram which we would all recognize today as a schematic control chart. That diagram, and the short text which preceded and followed it, set forth all of the essential principles and considerations which are involved in what we know today as process quality control."[1] Shewhart's work pointed out the importance of reducing variation in a manufacturing process and the understanding that continual process-adjustment in reaction to non-conformance actually increased variation and degraded quality.
Shewhart framed the problem in terms of assignable-cause and chance-cause variation and introduced the control chart as a tool for distinguishing between the two. Shewhart stressed that bringing a production process into a state of statistical control, where there is only chance-cause variation, and keeping it in control, is necessary to predict future output and to manage a process economically. Dr. Shewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of statistical control by carefully designed experiments. While Dr. Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he understood data from physical processes never produce a "normal distribution curve" (a Gaussian distribution, also commonly called a "bell curve"). He discovered that observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature (Brownian motion of particles). Dr. Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process, while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times.[2]
Shewhart worked to advance the thinking at Bell Telephone Laboratories from their foundation in 1925 until his retirement in 1956, publishing a series of papers in the Bell System Technical Journal.
His work was summarized in his book Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product (1931).
Shewhart’s charts were adopted by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) in 1933 and advocated to improve production during World War II in American War Standards Z1.1-1941, Z1.2-1941 and Z1.3-1942.
Later work[edit]
From the late 1930s onwards, Shewhart's interests expanded out from industrial quality to wider concerns in science and statistical inference. The title of his second book, Statistical Method from the Viewpoint of Quality Control (1939), asks the audacious question: "What can statistical practice, and science in general, learn from the experience of industrial quality control?"
Shewhart's approach to statistics was radically different from that of many of his contemporaries. He possessed a strong operationalist outlook, largely absorbed from the writings of pragmatist philosopher Clarence Irving Lewis, and this influenced his statistical practice. In particular, he had read Lewis' Mind and the World Order many times. Though he lectured in England in 1932 under the sponsorship of Karl Pearson (another committed operationalist) his ideas attracted little enthusiasm within the English statistical tradition. The British Standards nominally based on his work, in fact, diverge on serious philosophical and methodological issues from his practice.
His more conventional work led him to formulate the statistical idea of tolerance intervals and to propose his data presentation rules, which are listed below:

Data have no meaning apart from their context.
Data contain both signal and noise. To be able to extract information, one must separate the signal from the noise within the data.

Walter Shewhart visited India in 1947–1948 under the sponsorship of P. C. Mahalanobis of the Indian Statistical Institute. He toured the country, held conferences and stimulated interest in statistical quality control among Indian industrialists.[3]
He died at Troy Hills, New Jersey in 1967.
Influence[edit]
In 1938 his work came to the attention of physicists W. Edwards Deming and Raymond T. Birge. The two had been deeply intrigued by the issue of measurement error in science and had published a landmark paper in Reviews of Modern Physics in 1934. On reading of Shewhart's insights, they wrote to the journal to wholly recast their approach in the terms that Shewhart advocated.
The encounter began a long collaboration between Shewhart and Deming that involved work on productivity during World War II and Deming's championing of Shewhart's ideas in Japan from 1950 onwards. Deming developed some of Shewhart's methodological proposals around scientific inference and named his synthesis the Shewhart cycle.
To celebrate his quasquicentennial (125th) birth Anniversary, the Quality Technology and Quantitative Management[4] (QTQM) (ISSN 1684-3703) journal plans to produce a special issue in early 2017 on "Advances in the Theory and Application of Statistical Process Control".[5] The special issue will be edited by Prof. Min Xie of City University of Hong Kong and Dr. Amitava Mukherjee of XLRI - Xavier School of Management, Jamshedpur, India.
Achievements and honours[edit]
In his obituary for the American Statistical Association, Deming wrote of Shewhart:

As a man, he was gentle, genteel, never ruffled, never off his dignity. He knew disappointment and frustration, through failure of many writers in mathematical statistics to understand his point of view.

He was founding editor of the Wiley Series in Mathematical Statistics, a role that he maintained for twenty years, always championing freedom of speech and confident to publish views at variance with his own.
His honours included:

Founding member, fellow and president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics;
Founding member, first honorary member and first Shewhart Medalist of the American Society for Quality;
Fellow and President of the American Statistical Association;
Fellow of the International Statistical Institute;
Honorary fellow of the Royal Statistical Society;
Holley medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers;
Honorary Doctor of Science, Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta.

Best Answer: 
             Short Answer - Standard Deviation 

Your concept is correct – here is more detail: 

Walter Shewhart was the first person to develop something called control charts (in the 1930's), which utilize plus/minus six standard deviations from the mean of a group (population) of numbers.  Thus you could call this "Plus and Minus Three Sigma {Standard Deviations}" or "Six Sigma" 

However the term "Six Sigma" was first utilized by Motorola as a marketing ploy in helping them win the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1988.  As part of winning the award, all awardees must be open to presenting best practices to anyone who asks and the term "Six Sigma" was born.  It did not become popular until the mid-1990's after GE become successful in applying the Motorola methodology and integrating Six Sigma into their own existing processes. 

The all but forgotten fact is that back in 1988; Motorola was actually using the Shewhart definition of plus and minus three standard deviations.  Which was rejected by Ford Motor Company in the early 1990's because using that definition, did not meet the requirements for the Automotive Industry which was/is plus/minus four standard deviations for ongoing production products and plus/minus five standard deviations for prototype products. 

It wasn't until the late 1990's that the term "Six Sigma" came to represent plus/minus six standard deviations (which it still means today), however, even this is not totally true as the Six Sigma proponents use a variation (shifting factor) calculation that reduces the theoretical value to something less than the true value of six standard deviations.

Shewhart (the father of modern quality control) described his book as...an indication of the direction in which future developments may be expected to take place, could he have forseen its enormous impact? This monumental work laid the foundation for this modern quality control discipline, and it remains as current today as ever. it began as an attempt to develop a scientific basis for attaining economic control of quality through the establishment of control limits to indicate when the quality of product is varying more than is economically desirable. In his search for better knowledge of economy in manufacture, Shewhart touches upon all aspects of statistical quality control. the book includes a presentation of the fundamental concepts and advantages of statistical control; ways of expressing quality of product (a section containing a discourse that has been described as a masterpiece on the meaning of quality); the basis for specification of quality control; sampling fluctuations in quality; allowable variability in quality (which contains the first fully developed use of control charts); and quality control in practice. This is required reading for anyone seriously interested in the study of quality control. About the Author: the father of modern quality control, Walter A. Shewhart brought together the disciplines of statistics, engineering, and economics in a simple but highly effective tool: the control chart. This technique, and the principles behind it, have played key roles in economic developments from the 1940's through to the present day. Most of Shewhart's professional career was spent at Western Electric as an engineer from 1918 to 1924 and at Bell Telephone Laboratories from 1925 until his retirement in 1956. In addition, he served for more than 20 years as the first editor of the Mathematical Statistics Series published by John Wiley & Sons.

Chapter 72 – Walter Andrew Shewhart, Economic control of quality of manufactured product (1931)Denis BayartAvailable online 9 May 2007Publisher SummaryThis chapter deals with Walter Andrew Shewart's book, Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product. In this book, Shewhart brought together many of the statistical principles of industrial quality control. This book is the first publication to deal specifically with the control of industrial manufacturing processes by means of mathematical statistics. Shewhart studied the variability of physical quantities by regarding it as a property of the system of production and by representing it as a statistical distribution whose parameters could be estimated. But for such a hypothesis to be valid, it is necessary that a system of production be in a stable state, which Shewhart conceptualized under the name of “constant system of chance causes.” The contents of Shewhart's book consist of 25 chapters divided into seven parts, and three appendices. The touchstone of Shewhart's method, the first type is that where the “standard” of quality is given in advance, in the specification, in statistical form. The second type of situation is much more interesting and innovative: bringing the system into a state of maximum control, of a kind where the norm is a property of the system itself and not just grafted on. The reception of the book was initially limited. The publication of Shewhart's book concerned only statisticians and some specialists. However, it was the economic regime of the War that ensured the wide dissemination of the statistical control of quality in industry, both in the United States and in Great Britain, under the impetus of governments who saw in it the technical and economic advantages of rationalizing production.Copyright © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Walter A. Shewhart Walter Shewhart was a giant among giants in the quality movement during the first half of the 20th century. His mentoring of other engineers at Western Electric and his groundbreaking work with control charts arguably led a quality revolution and launched the quality profession.BackgroundWalter Andrew Shewhart was born to Anton and Esta Barney Shewhart on March 18, 1891, in New Canton, IL. Shewhart died on March 11, 1967, in Troy Hills, NJ. He attended the University of Illinois receiving bachelor’s and master’s degrees. In 1914, he married Edna Hart and moved to California where he earned his doctoral degree in physics while studying as a Whiting Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1917. He had brief stints of teaching at University of Illinois, University of California at Berkeley, and La Crosse State Teachers College (renamed Wisconsin State University), but his academic career was short-lived.In 1918, Shewhart joined the inspection engineering department of the Western Electric Co. in Hawthorne, IL. Western Electric manufactured telephone hardware for Bell Telephone Co. Although no one could have realized it at the time, Shewhart would alter the course of industrial history. Shewhart was part of a group of people who were all destined to become famous in their time. This group included Harold Dodge and Harry Romig, known for their work on product sampling plans. George D. Edwards, who became the first president of the American Society for Quality Control (renamed American Society for Quality in 1997), was Shewhart’s supervisor. Shewhart mentored many during his tenure, including Joseph M. Juran. During the summers of 1925 and 1926, W. Edwards Deming worked as an intern at the Hawthorne, IL, plant where he became interested in Shewhart’s work. 
Shewhart's ContributionEngineers at Bell Telephone had been working to improve the reliability of their transmissions systems. Business dictated a need to reduce the frequency of failures and repairs to their amplifiers, connectors and other equipment that were buried underground. Bell Telephone had already realized that reducing variation in manufacturing processes would have a positive impact on repair costs. At the same time the company determined that continual adjustments in process parameters reacting to non-conformances resulted in increased variation and a degradation of quality. Bell Telephone’s discoveries in product variation resulted in the institution of an inspection program, ensuring specification and quality standards to avoid sending defective products to customers. Even though this program was somewhat effective, it was very costly to deal with inspecting and sorting of finished goods. By 1924, Shewhart determined the problem of variability in terms of assignable cause and chance cause (Deming referred to this as common cause). On May 16, 1924, Shewhart prepared a memorandum of less than one page in length and forwarded it to his manager, George Edwards. About 1/3 of the page was devoted to a simple diagram that we would today recognize as a control chart. This memorandum set forth the essential principles and considerations that became known as process quality control. Shewhart’s principle was that bringing a process into a state of statistical control would allow the distinction between assignable and chance cause variations. By keeping the process in control, it would be possible to predict future output and to economically manage processes. This was the birth of the modern scientific study of process control. 
SPC Moves MainstreamAt its creation in 1925, Shewhart moved to the Bell Telephone Laboratories working to advance his theories and to bring together the disciplines of statistics, engineering and economics. In 1931 he published a book, “Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product.” It challenged the inspection-based approach to quality and introduced the modern era of quality management. Up until this time, statistical process control was largely a Bell Telephone quality tool. Shewhart’s book popularized statistical control and its use then spread throughout industry. From the 1930s forward, Shewhart’s interests expanded from industrial quality to wider concerns in science and statistical inference. In 1934, W. Edwards Deming and another physicist, Raymond T. Birge, published a paper on measurement error in science. However, after collaboration with Shewhart, they recast their approach and launched a long collaboration between Shewhart and Deming. Shewhart’s charts were adopted by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) in 1933. Shewhart and Deming impacted the improvement of production material during World War II in American War Standards Z1.1-1941, Z1.2-1941 and Z1.3-1942. Frequently, he was called upon as a consultant to the U.S. War Department, the United Nations and the government of India. Deming continued to champion Shewhart’s ideas, methodologies and theories throughout his career. While working with Japan, Deming further developed some of Shewhart’s methodological proposals of scientific interference, which had been named the Shewhart Cycle and was represented by the plan-do-check-act elements. Shewhart lectured extensively on the subjects of quality control and applied statistics in India, at the University of London, at Stevens Institute of Technology and at the graduate schools of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. He also was a member of many societies and governmental agencies. During the 1990s Shewhart’s work was rediscovered by a third generation of industrial engineers and managers, and this time it was repackaged and incorporated into the Six Sigma approach.Shewhart received many honors and awards that include:

Holley Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers
ASQ’s 1st Honorary Member
Founding Member and Fellow of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics
Fellow of the American Statistical Association
Fellow of the International Statistical Institute
Fellow of the Royal Society of Mechanical Engineers

Shewhart believed that statistical theory should serve the needs of industry and society as a whole. He challenged the norms of his day and showed manufacturers the better way that revolutionized industry. Upon his death in 1967, there were a multitude of commentaries from many contributors who were themselves important figures in the development of the quality field. An excerpt from a speech by the chairman of the committee that awarded the first ASQ Shewhart Medal captured Shewhart’s character in the following:“Shewhart’s legacy lives in mementos of him-a simple bowl and some numbered chips, a bronze medal, some books and writings. It lives in the succession of other prominent individuals he influenced, and it lives in the society of professionals who carry on the work he started.”
