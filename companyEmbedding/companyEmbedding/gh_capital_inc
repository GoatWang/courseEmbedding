CORE STRUCTURE: AFFORDABLE HOUSING




















GH Capital was formed in 2001 as a real estate private equity firm focused on affordable housing investments. Since then it has expanded to other asset classes within real estate, such as market-rate housing, self storage, and development.
 
Managed by Michael Clark, GH Capital focuses on investing with best-in-class real estate operators and developers, with a primary focus on the affordable housing space. GH Capital is different than many “funds” as its principals own both large and small real estate operating companies themselves. This gives them an enhanced understanding of the unique challenges and risks that operators and developers encounter. Therefore GH Capital is positioned to quickly evaluate and make investments, not only as a limited partner, but also as a general partner, providing co-investment, working capital, and making investments directly into the operating company.





INVESTMENT FOCUSES
LEADERSHIP BIOS
GHC COMPANIES







AFFORDABLE HOUSING GH Capital has invested in and acquired more than 20,000 affordable housing units nationwide, with a value exceeding $1.5BB.  Its investments have ranged from joint ventures in project-based Section 8 fee simple units to acquiring GP and LP interests in LIHTC properties and direct investments in operating and management companies, providing developers and non-profits ways to monetize illiquid positions, and/or provide growth capital for the future.



MARKET RATE HOUSING In 2012, GH Capital acquired a stake in a market-rate property management firm with more than 40,000 units under management. And since then, GH Capital has invested more than $100 million of equity in acquiring market-rate multifamily units.



SELF STORAGE In 2014 GH Capital began investing in self-storage acquisitions and development through one of the largest privately owned operators in the U.S. It is attracted to this asset class based on its fragmented market, mom-and-pop climate, and steady non-volatile cash flows.



OPPORTUNISTIC From time to time GH Capital is brought opportunities through its relationships that do not fall within housing or storage and makes investments when it finds unique opportunities to acquire assets, partnerships or companies at compelling prices.

Our competitors in the online payment industry are numerous in Europe. Our
competitors include financial institutions and well-established payment
processing companies. In Europe, specifically in Germany, we face competition
from both SOFORT GmbH and GIROPAY SOLUTIONS GmbH. We also face competition from
PayPal. Our primary competitor is SOFORT and they offer a nearly identical
service that we intend on offering. However, we intend on providing the service
at reduced costs in the hopes that merchants will prefer our service.

We also face competition from Giropay Solutions which has a minimal market share
of online payment transactions compared to SOFORT GmbH and is only able to
process transactions through a smaller percentage of banks in Germany. We also
face competition from PayPal in Europe. 

In Europe, financial institutions remain the primary providers of merchant
acquiring payment services to merchants, although the outsourcing of these
services to third-party service providers is becoming more prevalent. Merchant
acquiring payment services have become increasingly complex, requiring
significant capital commitments to develop, maintain and update the systems
necessary to provide these advanced services at competitive prices.


Company Description
GH Capital, Inc., a Florida corporation, has developed an online payment gateway
called “ClickDirectPay” to process online wire transfer transactions for 
diversified online merchants with a target market in Europe. We were 
incorporated on May 5, 2014 in the State of Florida. On November 12, 2015,


 we 
filed a certificate of amendment with the State of Florida to change our name
from Global Humax Capital Management, Inc. to GH Capital, Inc.

Our service intends on allowing web-based merchants to utilize ClickDirectPay,
which is available at https://www.clickdirectpay.com. More specifically, we plan
on focusing on establishing ClickDirectPay as a cost-effective alternative to
current payment gateway systems used throughout Europe. Our service will assist
online merchants to increase profits by reducing existing processing costs.
Currently, customers and users throughout Europe (including Germany, Austria,
Spain, Italy, Greece, and the Netherlands) prefer to pay bills with an online
wire transfer instead of paying with credit cards or Paypal. We believe our
ClickDirectPay payment gateway will meet the needs of the European online
marketplace. 

ClickDirectPay began Beta testing of the system on May 6, 2016. The Beta testing
is currently limited to one merchant accepting real-time transactions from
customers. The service is only available to the single merchant from 9am to 8pm
Central Europe Time (the service will be available 24 hours a day when fully
operational).

Evolution of retail opened up a lot of opportunities in this arena, and payment services industry is in the midst of growth. However, the geographic balance is different. Europe favors the online banking electronic services as compared to other alternatives. Credit cards only make up 21% of the transactions in German e-commerce market. iDeal is among the leading provider in Netherlands with Sofort GmbH leads in Germany and Europe. But, investors can't get a piece of action as both of these are private companies.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with AMZN. Click here to check it out. GHHC 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GHHCPeter Lynch Chart of GHHCGH Capital Inc (GHHC) is one of the companies involved in providing the online banking electronic payment (OBeP) services, which can be accessed through OTC markets. The company is taking on the likes of iDeal and Sofort GmbH. The bull case for GH Capital was discussed in detail previously. Here's the summary of why GH Capital is a good opportunity.First, the company is focusing on the European market with its online baking electronic payment services. Online banking payments are supported by banks as they try to ward-off alternative competition. GH Capital can create problems for its competitors through its unique pricing strategy. Despite widely accepted volume based pricing model, GH Capital has adopted a stepped fixed model, which allows merchants to scale at lower costs. As switching costs are almost none for the consumer, and merchants see no harm in integrating cheaper solutions, this pricing model creates problem for big players like iDeal and Sofort GmbH.Reasons for potential takeoverBig corporations are usually reluctant to slash prices in order to protect margin. They usually ignore small competition until it becomes a theat. And, the safest course of action is to acquire a small company that has potential of gaining market share. This seems to be the case for GH Capital Inc. The company supports only around 350 merchants as of now, but it's planning to hit a 10,000 target by 2018. A low number of merchants don't hurt competitors but this is changing.1. More visibility across merchantsFixed pricing and low switching costs is attracting merchants to sign up for GH Capital's ClickDirectPay (CDP) solution. According to recent reports, GH Capital is in talks with a leading online payment provision aggregator, Allied Wallet, to make CDP available through their platform. The deal will make CDP visible across Europe including Germany. It is worth mentioning that Allied Wallet, a leading provider of online payment processing offering various payment solutions in 196 countries, has seen large-scale, trending growth in e-commerce transactions and a spike in new merchants by accepting alternative payment methods in Germany. Inclusion of GH Capital's CDP in Allied Wallet's portfolio will solve the merchant visibility problem for the CDP. This is one of the primary reasons competitors will seriously think about making a bid for the subsidiary of GH Capital.2. Partnership with hyper scale retailersFurther, the management is in talks with one of the largest retailers in Germany to integrate CDP with their payment systems. Being able to secure a deal with a large retailer also puts a question mark on competitors' market share. The deal, if finalized, will strengthen potential acquisition prospects for CDP. Note that GH Capital also competes in the high risk merchant space where mainstream service providers like PayPal (PYPL) have no presence.Bottom lineThe point is that increasing merchant exposure and a few big merchant inclusions will force some of the large competitors to bid for CDP. Cutting competition on prices isn't a choice as it affects margin and GH Capital's management believe that competitors are unable to slash prices. Therefore, it is probable that CDP will gain material market share if competitors don't revisit their pricing model.From an investor's perspective, it's a win-win. In case of a takeover, a hefty gain is in the cards as takeover bids for OTC companies are materially above the trading market price. Without a takeover, CDP has the potential to gain market share amid stepped fixed pricing and European exposure. However, be aware - OTC markets entail high risk and limited liquidity.Disclosure:  We have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.Warning!
