Roumell Opportunistic Value Fund







To learn more about Roumell Asset Management, LLC, please visit www.roumellasset.com
"[Roumell Opportunistic Fund] is run by James Roumell, a Chevy Chase, Md. money manager who was one of the stars of the Wall Street Journal's now-defunct stock picking contest. Roumell says his main criterion for deep value is a positive answer to the question, 'Would I take this company private in a heartbeat?'" ~Kiplinger's Personal Finance, May 2011


The Roumell Opportunistic Value Fund ("A" share/RAMVX, Institutional share/RAMSX, "C" share/RAMDX) follows the same deep-value, Opportunistic Capital Allocation (OCA) 
strategy that we have adhered to since 1998. The Roumell Opportunistic Value Fund seeks to achieve its objective by holding a combination of equity, debt and cash 
reflecting a broad mandate to pursue value where we find it. In the absence of sufficient investment opportunities, the Fund will hold cash.
 The Fund is managed by Jim Roumell.

Honoring Your Trust
Investors in our Fund have committed hard-earned capital to our care. We honor that 
act of trust in the following ways:

The partners at Roumell Asset Management, LLC invest right alongside their clients.
In contrast to typical disclosure practices in the mutual fund industry, we report in our annual and semi-annual reports the cost basis of the securities in the Fund, as well as realized gains and losses.
We intend to keep our assets at a size that enables us to remain nimble and participate in less liquid segments of the market that can have a substantial impact on portfolio performance.
