IntroductionOff Road Capital Management, LLC, is a New York City investment firm focused on investing in private assets that are idiosyncratic and less correlated to traditional asset classes. Each of the founders have greater than twenty years of experience in public and private markets and both successfully operated their own investment firms, Altitude Capital Partners and Loeb King Capital Management. They have collaborated for eleven years by participating on Boards together, investing in each-other’s funds, and analyzing and consummating investments. Off Road is a reflection of their combined investment expertise across a broad array of asset classes, and constitutes a formal process of sourcing, analyzing, and structuring investments in niche private assets in order to earn high quality and attractive risk-adjusted returns for clients and founders.
About UsRobert KramerRobert Kramer is a founder and Managing Member of Off Road Capital Management. In 2005, he founded Altitude Capital Partners. As the Managing Partner, he pioneered intellectual property as an asset class in the technology space. Five years after he founded the firm, he formed a strategic partnership with Apple, creating Altitude’s last portfolio company. The portfolio company later sold the majority of its assets to a public company, RPX Corporation. Altitude generated 26% net internal rates of return for its investors.* Prior to Altitude, Mr. Kramer served as a Partner for Fortress Investment Group’s Drawbridge Special Opportunities Fund, where he specialized in litigation claims and other illiquid eclectic investments. Mr. Kramer was a Managing Director at Merrill Lynch & Co., where he specialized in leveraged finance and communications.
Mr. Kramer received his Bachelor of Science degree with honors from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and his MBA from the Columbia Graduate School of Business in 1988.

Being an integral part of a multi-asset-class vehicle for over 20 years accounts for Mr. King’s vast experience in a variety of areas, including global public and private assets, DIP Loans, trade claims, banks debt, arcane debt-linked and equity-linked instruments, public special situations and risk-arbitrage, litigation investments and vehicles, activist investments, SPACs, options, and other derivatives.
Mr. King received his Bachelor of the Arts degree in English from Northwestern University in 1992.  
* The composition of the Off Road investment team and the composition of Altitude Capital Partners and Loeb King responsible for investment performance discussed on this page are not the same, and Off Road is not affiliated with either Altitude Capital Partner or Loeb King. The success of the Altitude Capital Partners or Loeb King is not predictive of the success of Off Road.  Certain performance calculations are prepared internally and have not been audited or verified by a third party. The use of a different methodology for preparing, calculating or presenting performance returns may lead to different results and such differences may be material.
PhilosophyOff Road Capital Management is governed by a select core of beliefs and principles. A strong alignment of interest with our investors and operating partners is central to our operating philosophy. Transacting and partnering with driven high-integrity professionals is an imperative. Having processes in place designed to protect downside is of paramount importance; we use financial structuring (preferred equity, debt, “top of waterfall” mechanisms), deep value analysis, and scenario-based stress testing to exhaustively measure and intended to mitigate the risk of loss. A search for the facts and a focus on transformative issues distinguishes our approach. We place great value on diversification, as we understand from vast experience that too much conviction and concentration is dangerous.
 Our primary objective is to expose Off Road partners to asset classes and returns to which most family offices and institutions are not privy. We believe such niche private assets can provide attractive returns without stock market volatility and high correlation to traditional asset classes. We are prepared to take intelligent calculated risks and adopt “out of the box thinking.” From years of experience we have learned that impressive returns can be generated by focusing on smaller niche assets that are difficult to source, diligence, and structure. We believe that illiquidity can be an alpha-generative asset which many in the investment world simply cannot exploit because of structural impediments and asset-liability matching hurdles.
Simply, we are “Off Road” investors that have unstinting conviction in the idea that through a vigorous search process we attempt to find uncommon mispriced assets with upside optionality by partnering with best-in-class and ethical operators, asset managers, and industry specialists.
Our UniverseOff Road Capital Management sits at the nexus between those in search of differentiated investments and those with unique business models in need of flexible capital (industry specialist and niche operators).
Off Road’s investor-base includes some of substantial offices, investing institutions, and high-net-worth individuals. Our sophisticated and well-capitalized investor base affords us the ability to execute on “co-investment” opportunities of significant scale and of atypical nature.
Off Road may be a solution for niche businesses and asset classes in need of strategic and creative capital to permit growth.Sourcing and Value CreationOff Road’s founders have fifty years of collective experience and relationships that span the investment ecosystem.
These valued relationships form a holistic approach to sourcing and executing upon transactions.
FocusWhere We Typically Invest
Investment Size: $5-40 million
Agnostic to structure and instrument: debt, preferred equity, straight equity, contractual cash flow instruments, hybrid vehicles
Investment Durations: 2-6 years
Governance: Minority positions with high visibility into business process or control stakes with board representation if appropriate
Areas of interest: credit / cash flow assets, industry niches, specialty finance/insurance, special situations, litigation claims

Off Road invests in uncommon risk-return profiles that have “visible returns,” or cash flow streams and stores of value that can be identified with probing research, an examination of history, and high-touch fact-finding.
  Where We Typically Don’t Invest
Traditional private equity
Venture capital 
Macro themes

Off Road does not purport to be able to predict complex macro events and trends.  Off Road is not a solution for institutions that must put billions of dollars to work in standard products. 
Off Road’s founders understand that successful business relationships must be symbiotic; we strive to add value by helping to prepare companies, specialists, operators, and fund managers for their next phase of growth. After we invest we provide advice and support in capital allocation, strategic planning, mergers and acquisitions, sales and marketing, and other vital initiatives.

Company website:  offroadcapital.comFirm opens doors to deals online - offerings only available to accredited investors! Must have net worth over $1,000,000. Minimum investment is $25,000.By Bill Meyers, USA TODAY Steve Pelletier thought he had created the next eBay or Amazon.com. So he pitched the concept to his colleagues at Benchmark Capital, thered-hot Silicon Valley venture capital firm backed by high-tech titans such as Michael Dell, Scott McNealy and Craig McCaw.      Benchmark, which has invested more than $250 million in digital enterprises since 1995, was lukewarm to Pelletier's idea.      Undeterred, Pelletier left Benchmark and went on to launch OffRoad Capital -- the first Web site that allows affluent individuals to invest electronically in established private growth companies seeking financing.      OffRoad, says Pelletier, "was too close to home for Benchmark. I saw a lot of opportunity, but it's not clear how much they saw."      More than 90 individual investors saw plenty. And, confounding the powerful pros at Benchmark, they anted up more than $7 million for OffRoad, which officially goes on line next month.      "It's a magnificent concept," says Dan Brumbaugh, a senior finance fellow at the Milken Institute and one of OffRoad's first backers. "That was clear to me after hearing the first 25 words."      For interested investors, the concept is simple. After going to OffRoad's Web site (www.offroadcapital.com), all they have to do is click on an icon for an application form. To become an OffRoad member, a person must be 21 or older, have $1 million in household net worth and understand the Securities and Exchange Commission rules.      Investors must also pay a $1,000 initiation fee (waived until June 15) and undergo credit and background checks before reviewing the deals OffRoad will feature on line monthly. The minimum investment in a deal will be $25,000.      Based in San Francisco, OffRoad is known as a butterfly company in Silicon Valley because it carries two groups of people who want to do business with each other on its wings.      The 5.7 million American households with $1 million or more in assets account for about two-thirds of the nation's wealth. Yet thesehigh-net-worth players rarely get a chance to invest in private companies that might soon go public.      "Unless you hear about this kind of transaction at the country club, you almost never get to participate," says Pelletier, 45.      "When it comes to money, high-net-worth investors are pretty     sophisticated and self-directed. They're saying, 'Give us the opportunities, show us the deals.' "      Capital chasm      For their part, the 400,000 private companies in the USA with 10 or more     employees account for $2 trillion in book assets. Yet when they're looking     to raise between $1 million and $10 million, these firms often plunge into a     capital chasm and are forced to scrounge together the needed funds     themselves.      That's because most venture capitalists and investment banks overlook     established companies looking to raise $1 million to $15 million, and     outside individuals traditionally invest less than $1 million.      OffRoad, says Dan Burke of Gomez Advisors, a research firm specializing     in electronic commerce for consumers, has the potential to be "a     double-hot situation with so many private companies seeking money and     the enormous demand among high-net-worth investors."      Still, Pelletier and his colleagues at OffRoad will face competition. W.R.     Hambrecht, for example, is making initial public offerings available on line.     And Garage.com has raised money for start-up companies.      Pelletier is unfazed. And he points out that OffRoad's companies won't be     in the embryonic stage - they'll have customers, revenues, profits and plans     to go public.      "We're not going to ask people to invest money in an untested idea     created by three guys with 10 slides," says OffRoad's founder. "With our     companies, there will be real tires you can kick."      To kick the tires and examine OffRoad's deals, investors will be able to     chat on line with each cash-hungry company and ask questions before they     buy in. OffRoad subscribers will also be able to discuss the transactions     with each other on the Web. And OffRoad's private companies will be     required to disclose their quarterly results.      It's still unclear whether the digital-deal concept will appeal to     high-net-worth investors.      "It's not as simple as posting a plan on the Net and then waiting for people     to send you the check," says Guy Kawasaki, founder of Garage.com.     "Initial interest is piqued by e-mail and Web sites, but it often comes down     to face-to-face meetings before they invest."      After helping Intuit grow from $44 million to $600 million between 1991     and 1996, Pelletier knows a lot about investor behavior.      "Steve sees the trends early," says Bill Campbell, chairman of the board at     Intuit. "He's a technology person who really understands the needs of     consumers."      The entrepreneurial bug      A Harvard philosophy major, Pelletier learned the high-tech side of the     business at Kurzweil Computer Products, where he helped create a     reading machine for the blind in the late 1970s. Then he moved to Interleaf     in the early 1980s and developed desktop publishing products.      Pelletier's advanced education in consumer marketing took root at Intuit     when he worked with Scott Cook, the company's co-founder, a former     Procter & Gamble executive.      After Microsoft's failed acquisition of Intuit, Pelletier left the company and     took six months off to recharge before going to Benchmark.      While serving as entrepreneur-in-residence at the venture capital firm, he     sat in a conference room and listened as scores of start-ups made their     pitches for funding.      "It was an eye-opening experience for me," Pelletier says. "At first I     thought, 'Why would anybody start a business?' It's scary, and the failure     rate is high. Then I told myself, 'You can do this!' I guess I really got the     entrepreneurial bug."      Benchmark listened to his proposal for OffRoad but walked away.      "We passed initially for a couple of reasons," says Benchmark's Kevin     Harvey. "Primarily, we wanted a tighter focus on high-tech, later-stage     financings. ... I think it's too early to say that we won't work together     (including an investment this time)."      Radical business model      Pelletier persevered after other venture capital firms rejected his radical     new business model for private equity financing. After four months and     many meetings with investors, he had his funding in place.      Along the way, he picked up support from the Milken Institute, a nonprofit     economic think tank started and sponsored by Michael Milken, the     once-convicted former high-yield bond whiz. In the 1980s, Milken     recognized a similar capital crunch and financed the same type of     companies that OffRoad plans to back.      Three members of the Milken Institute are now on OffRoad's advisory     board. Steven Wallman, a former commissioner of the Securities and     Exchange Commission, is a member of OffRoad's board of directors. And     Susan Woodward, the former chief economist of the SEC, now serves in     the same role at OffRoad.      During the past month, OffRoad has analyzed more than 200 established     private companies that are seeking cyberfunding on its site. If selected,     these firms will pay OffRoad 3% to 9% of the capital raised for them.      Pelletier also reports that 1,000 high-net-worth investors have signed up     as OffRoad subscribers. His goal: 5,000 subscribers a year from now.      By then, Benchmark Capital and Silicon Valley will know if OffRoad can     hold its own in the technology fast lane.

Suburban Propane Partners, L.P. Announces Closing of Public Offering of Common Units, Exercise of Over-Allotment Option, Repayment of 364-day Incremental Term Loan Facility and Distribution of Spin-Off Units

WHIPPANY, N.J., Aug. 20, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Suburban Propane Partners, L.P. (NYSE:   SPH) ("Suburban"), a nationwide distributor of propane, fuel oil and related products and services, as well as a marketer of natural gas and electricity, announced today that its underwritten public offering of 6,300,000 common units representing limited partner interests in Suburban was closed on August 14, 2012 (the "Initial Closing Date"). The offering was priced at $37.61 per common unit. Wells Fargo Securities, BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank Securities, Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan and Raymond James acted as joint book-running managers of the offering. Stifel Nicolaus Weisel acted as co-manager of the offering.
On the Initial Closing Date, Suburban received approximately $226.5 million of net proceeds from the offering (after considering underwriter commissions and other estimated offering expenses). Also on the Initial Closing Date, Suburban used the net proceeds from the offering to repay its borrowing of $225 million on August 1, 2012 under its 364-day incremental term loan facility (the "364-Day Facility") provided under the First Amendment to its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement"), dated August 1, 2012, incurred in connection with its acquisition of Inergy, L.P.'s ("Inergy") retail propane operations on that date. The Credit Agreement provides for the reinstatement and increase from $150.0 million to $250.0 million of the existing uncommitted incremental term facility under the Credit Agreement upon repayment of the 364-Day Facility. 
On August 15, 2012, the underwriters gave notice of the exercise of their over-allotment option to purchase from Suburban an additional 945,000 common units representing limited partner interests in Suburban at a price of $37.61 per common unit. Suburban will receive approximately $34.1 million of net proceeds from the underwriters' exercise of the over-allotment option (after considering underwriter commissions and other estimated offering expenses) upon the delivery of the additional common units, which is expected to occur on August 20, 2012, subject to customary closing conditions.
The remaining net proceeds from the offering, including the proceeds from the underwriters' purchase of 945,000 additional common units pursuant to the over-allotment option in connection with the offering, will be used for working capital and general partnership purposes.
An electronic copy of the prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus may be obtained at no charge on the website for the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") at http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1005210/000119312512347959/d392012d424b5.htm.
On August 17, 2012, Inergy announced that the board of directors of Inergy's general partner had declared August 29, 2012 as the record date, and September 14, 2012 as the distribution date, for the previously announced spin-off to Inergy's unitholders of 14,058,418 of the aggregate 14,200,422 Suburban common units acquired by Inergy on August 1, 2012 in connection with Suburban's acquisition of Inergy's retail propane operations.
