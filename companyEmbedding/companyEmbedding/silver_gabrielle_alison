Research interests
My research examines the acquisition and processing of syntax and 
        
      semantics by adult second language learners, focusing on the cognitive and linguistic factors that impact development and ultimate attainment. These issues are addressed using a range of experimental methods including behavioral, psycholinguistic, and electrophysiological measures.

Alison Moore DesignsSince Feb 2012 / 527 reviewsThis partner has a rating of 5 starsaboutproductsreviewsneed to knowAboutHandmade & designed with care in ScotlandI'm Alison and I live on an island far, far away... welcome to my wee shop.Just off the most northerly tip of Scotland lies a group of islands called Orkney. Here you'll find me working away in my studio creating unique pieces of jewellery.Living in such a beautiful place, of course my work is influenced by these wonderful surroundings, but I am also inspired by what is happening around me – whether it be the environment, an unusual gemstone, fashion, moods or memories.As a former student of geology, I love rocks! So it isn't a surprise that I add gemstones where ever I can to my jewellery which add touches of colour, light and sparkle. My work reflects my own personal style as I aim to create unique pieces that are understated, timeless yet utterly contemporary. I try to create work which is elegant, with simple yet distinctively clean lines. My style has been described as refined whimsy.I hope that you find my jewellery refreshingly pure, and most certainly to be treasured.Like this partner?Share it on Share on Facebook Share on TwitterOur Productsview all productsThis is a product from Alison Moore Designs named 18ct Gold Diamond Pebble Cluster Ring18ct Gold Diamond Pebble Cluster Ring£1850This is a product from Alison Moore Designs named Solid 9ct Gold Amethyst Guinevere RingSolid 9ct Gold Amethyst Guinevere Ring£440This is a product from Alison Moore Designs named Solid Gold And Silver Blue Topaz Birthstone Alice RingSolid Gold And Silver Blue Topaz Birthstone Alice Ring£159This is a product from Alison Moore Designs named Frozen Labradorite Silver Stacking RingsFrozen Labradorite Silver Stacking Rings£110This is a product from Alison Moore Designs named Whimberry Amethyst Silver Stacking RingsWhimberry Amethyst Silver Stacking Rings£110This is a product from Alison Moore Designs named Cinderella Aquamarine March Birthstone RingCinderella Aquamarine March Birthstone Ring£180This is a product from Alison Moore Designs named Solid Gold December Birthstone Tanzanite Solitaire RingSolid Gold December Birthstone Tanzanite Solitaire Ring£465This is a product from Alison Moore Designs named Solid Rose Gold Morganite StudsSolid Rose Gold Morganite Studs£285This is a product from Alison Moore Designs named Solid Rose Gold Labradorite Stacking Ring SetSolid Rose Gold Labradorite Stacking Ring Set£869This is a product from Alison Moore Designs named Simple Handmade Mens Wedding Ring In 9ct Or 18ct GoldSimple Handmade Mens Wedding Ring In 9ct Or 18ct Gold£505Handmade on the remote Scottish islands of OrkneyEach piece of jewellery designed & made with careReviewsView Productlink to view product"Love Love Love it.

A simple, thin gemstone stacking ring featuring a lovely semi-precious shaped and polished pastel colooured gemstone of your choice.
These lovely silver stacking rings can be worn on their own, mixed with other gemstone rings or stacked with my beaded stacking rings (available as part of my full range).
Ideal for wearing lots together on one finger and creating your own stacking ring combination, or simply one on its own for a delicate look.
Each ring is handmade in my studio in the Orkney Islands, off the northern coast of Scotland, using natural gemstones. Each of the stones featured here are birthstones, so one of these could make a very thoughtful gift.
The rings are handmade to your UK ring size. It can be helpful to have your ring size professionally measured before ordering. Of course, exchanges can be made after you place your order, but will be subject to a re-delivery charge.
There are plenty of gemstones to choose from, some of which are birthstones:
Rose Quartz (pale pink)
December - Blue Topaz (pale blue)
Prehnite (pale green)
June - Moonstone (white)
Labradorite (grey)
Please note that as these stones are naturally occurring, colours and inclusions will vary from stone to stone.
Each order from Alison Moore Designs arrives beautifully packaged, with information about where the product was hand crafted (Orkney, north Scotland) and how to look after your jewellery. It will be beautifully boxed and giftwrapped (if you wish) and on items over £50, we now include a free jewellery polishing cloth to keep your jewellery in tip top shape.
made from:
The rings are made using sterling silver and genuine cabochon cut gemstones. Matching earrings also available in my store along with vibrant coloured stacking rings.
dimensions:
The rings have a 0.15cm wide band, and the gemstones are 0.6cm wide.
