Job Details
               WildBlue's Mission Is To Make Affordable Broadband Internet Access Available To Everyone. WildBlue delivers affordable two-way broadband Internet access via satellite to virtually any home and small business in small cities and rural America. WildBlue uses a 26-inch satellite minidish equipped with both a transmitter and receiver for two-way satellite connectivity to the Internet. WildBlue service does not require cable or phone lines. It is accessible to virtually every home and small business in the contiguous U.S., including the estimated 20-25 million homes and small offices that are not wired for terrestrial (DSL or cable modem) service. WildBlue's approach is based on next generation, two-way wireless Ka-band spot beam satellite technology, which lowers the cost of providing high bandwidth access to the Internet. WildBlue uses industry standard technology in its consumer premise equipment. The resulting low cost structure enables an affordably priced high-speed Internet service that is available across the country. WildBlue's core service offers homes and small offices/home offices (SOHO) an Internet connection that is easy to use, reliable, always on, and significantly faster than standard dial-up service. WildBlue Internet service for consumers includes typical Internet Service Provider features (email, web space, etc.). It opens up a window to a world of rich content that is largely unavailable through dial-up service and largely unavailable in areas unserved by cable modem or DSL service. With WildBlue, for example, consumers can download a movie on demand, attend University courses hundreds of miles away or quickly email a family photo. Though these services are familiar to some, 20-25 million homes and small offices across the country cannot access high-speed internet services because the technology has not reached them...until now.
