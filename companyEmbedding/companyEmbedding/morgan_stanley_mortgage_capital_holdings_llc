1Through the pledged-asset feature offered by Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association, the applicant(s) or third party pledgor (collectively “Client”) may be able to pledge eligible securities in lieu of a full or partial cash down payment or in connection with a refinance mortgage loan. To be eligible for the pledged-asset feature a Client must have a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC. If the value of the pledged securities in the account drops below the agreed-upon level stated in the loan documents, a Client may be required to deposit additional securities or other collateral (such as cash) to stay in compliance with the terms of the mortgage loan. If a Client does not deposit additional securities or other collateral, the Client’s pledged securities may be sold to satisfy the Client’s obligation, and the Client will not be entitled to choose which assets will be sold. Thus in deciding whether the pledged-asset feature is appropriate, a Client should consider the degree to which he or she is comfortable subjecting his or her investment in a home to the fluctuations of the securities market. The pledged-asset feature is not available in all states. Other restrictions may apply.
2A conditional approval letter, which is subject to conditions, is not a commitment to lend.
3 Relationship-based pricing offered by Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association is based on the value of clients’, or their immediate family members’ (i.e., grandparents, parents, and children) eligible assets (collectively “Household Assets”) held within accounts at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC. To be eligible for relationship-based pricing, Household Assets must be maintained within appropriate eligible accounts prior to the closing date of the residential mortgage loan. Relationship-based pricing is not available on conforming loans.

When deciding whether an adjustable rate mortgage is right for your situation, you should consider the risk of rising rates and rising payments as well as other factors such as how long you plan to own your home.
Residential mortgage loans/home equity lines of credit are offered by Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association, an affiliate of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC. With the exception of the pledged-asset feature, an investment relationship with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC does not have to be established or maintained to obtain the residential mortgage products offered by Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association. All residential mortgage loans/home equity lines of credit are subject to the underwriting standards and independent approval of Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association. Rates, terms, and programs are subject to change without notice. Residential mortgage loans/home equity lines of credit may not be available in all states; not available in Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Other restrictions may apply. The information contained herein should not be construed as a commitment to lend. Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association is an Equal Housing Lender and Member FDIC that is primarily regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System Unique Identifier #663185. The proceeds from a residential mortgage loan (including draws and advances from a home equity line of credit) are not permitted to be used to purchase, trade, or carry eligible margin stock; repay margin debt that was used to purchase, trade, or carry margin stock; or to make payments on any amounts owed under the note, loan agreement, or loan security agreement; and cannot be deposited into a Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC or other brokerage account.
Interest-only loans enable borrowers to make monthly payments of only the accrued monthly interest on the loan during the introductory interest-only period. Once that period ends, borrowers must make monthly payments of principal and interest for the remaining loan term, and payments will be substantially higher than the interest-only payments. During the interest-only period, the total interest that the borrower will be obligated to pay will vary based on the amount of principal paid down, if any. If a borrower makes just an interest-only payment, and no payment of principal, the total interest payable by the borrower during the interest-only period will be greater than the total interest that a borrower would be obligated to pay on a traditional loan of the same interest rate having principal-and-interest payments. In making comparisons between an interest-only loan and a traditional loan, borrowers should carefully review the terms and conditions of the various loan products available and weigh the relative merits of each type of loan product appropriately.
1-Month Interest only ARM loan is based on 1-Month LIBOR. 1-Month Interest only ARM loan is not available in Maine.
Private Bankers are employees of Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National Association.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC is a registered Broker/Dealer, Member SIPC, and not a bank. Where appropriate, Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC has entered into arrangements with banks and other third parties to assist in offering certain banking related products and services. 
Investment, insurance and annuity products offered through Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC are: NOT FDIC INSURED | MAY LOSE VALUE | NOT BANK GUARANTEED | NOT A BANK DEPOSIT | NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY

Morgan Stanley to Pay $275 Million for Misleading Investors in Subprime RMBS Offerings




07/24/2014FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
	2014-144
Washington D.C. — The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged three Morgan Stanley entities with misleading investors in a pair of residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) securitizations that the firms underwrote, sponsored, and issued.
Morgan Stanley agreed to settle the charges by paying $275 million to be returned to harmed investors.
In an asset-backed securities offering, federal regulations under the securities laws require the disclosure of delinquency information for the mortgage loans serving as collateral.  An SEC investigation found that Morgan Stanley misrepresented the current or historical delinquency status of mortgage loans underlying two subprime RMBS securitizations that came against a backdrop of rising borrower delinquencies and unprecedented distress in the subprime market.
“The delinquency status of mortgage loans in an RMBS securitization is vital information to investors because those loans are the primary source of funds by which they potentially can recover and profit from their investments,” said Michael Osnato, chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Complex Financial Instruments Unit.  “Morgan Stanley understated the number of delinquent loans behind these securitizations during a critical juncture of the financial crisis and denied investors the full extent of the facts necessary to make informed investment decisions.”
According to the SEC’s order instituting a settled administrative proceeding against Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc., and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC, these securitizations were collateralized by mortgage loans with an aggregate principal value balance of more than $2.5 billion.  They were the last subprime RMBS that Morgan Stanley sponsored, issued, and underwrote.  The offerings themselves were called Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 2007-NC4 and Morgan Capital I Inc. Trust 2007-HE7.
The SEC’s order finds that offering documents for the securitizations stated that less than 1 percent of each pool’s aggregate principal balance was more than 30 days but less than 60 days delinquent as of each securitization’s cut-off date.  With the exception of these loans, Morgan Stanley represented as of each securitization’s closing date that no payment under any mortgage loan was more than 30 days delinquent at any time since origination.  On the contrary, approximately 17 percent of the loans in the HE7 securitization had been delinquent at some point since origination, and in the NC4 securitization approximately 4.5 percent of the loans were currently delinquent rather than the disclosed 1 percent.
According to the SEC’s order, for the HE7 securitization, Morgan Stanley had a chart showing that approximately 17 percent of the loans had been delinquent at some point since origination, and Morgan Stanley also used information about payments made after the cut-off date to determine the loans disclosed as delinquent as of the cut-off date.  By using the later payment data, Morgan Stanley misreported 46 fewer loans as currently delinquent, leading the firm to disclose that less than 1 percent of the loans were delinquent.  The NC4 securitization did not close until the month after the cut-off date, so Morgan Stanley received updated payment information at that time. This information showed that approximately 4.5 percent of the loans had become delinquent.  Yet despite the delayed closing and a representation that extended the delinquency representation to the closing, Morgan Stanley did not disclose or remove the additional delinquent loans and instead continued with the 1 percent figure.
The SEC charged Morgan Stanley with violations of Sections 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933.  Without admitting or denying the allegations, the firm agreed to the entry of an order that requires a payment of $160,627,852 in disgorgement, $17,995,437 in prejudgment interest, and a $96,376,711 penalty.  The order notes that a Fair Fund is being created for the disgorgement, interest, and penalties paid in this case for the purpose of returning money to investors who were harmed in these securitizations.
The SEC’s investigation was conducted by Andrew Sporkin, Jeffrey Weiss, Creola Kelly, Melissa Lessenberry, and Delmer Raibourn in the Complex Financial Instruments Unit with assistance from Kyle DeYoung of the trial unit and Eugene Canjels in the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis.  The SEC appreciates the assistance of the federal-state Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy

                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        LendingTree, LLC has received 4.27 out of 5 stars based on 98 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
