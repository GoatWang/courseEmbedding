Sharon France






 "My contemporary country landscapes are of the old farms, barns, farmhouses, animals, and quiet rural scenes that I love to paint. The ideas for my paintings come from my imagination, memories, and impressions of the places that I have been and seen here in the Midwestern Heartland."Landscape painter Sharon France's work has been described as "having an intriguing peacefulness in its quiet simplicity." France feels blessed to live on an old farmstead in the Heartland, surrounded by the quiet and peaceful countryside that she loves to paint.France works in both acrylic and oil paint, although she most often works in acrylic on stretched canvas for her original landscapes. She paints by a process of building up many thin layers using both wet and dry brush techniques.France received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Northern Illinois University. Her skill in landscape and animal painting has come from the experience of working to slowly develop her distinctive style over time. France is a juried member of the Society of Animal Artists.

Sculpture 
All sculpture is three-dimensional, but beyond that, it's as diverse as the artists who create it. Today's finest North American artists create a beautiful variety of sculpture from glass, ceramic, wood, metal, and other materials; sculpture meant to be lived with and enjoyed.

Our Foie Gras, Pates and Rillettes are handpicked and carefully sources, bringing you the best of the best of French cuisine. Palme d’Or Foie Gras is produced in Quebec by a French company with time honored French recipes and methods. Brittany Henaff Pate is fantastic on fresh croissants and baguettes, a piece of toast and 
        
with our cornichons. Britanny Henaff Pork Rillettes and Rougie Duck Rillettes are delicious, but so is Rougie countryside pate. Pick up the large size Foie Gras and share with some friends, or have a little bit just for yourself. Either way, enjoy and try our buy foie gras online in the US today. 




History of Foie GrasFoie gras means “fat liver” in French – doesn’t sound that delicious, but it actually is! It’s made from the livers of geese or ducks that have been fattened up, in North America this is regulated strictly with natural feeding methods and rules against harsh treatment.
             
We source our Foie Gras from Quebec – due to strict import rules from the USDA it’s virtually impossible to get imported from France.Foie Gras can actually be traced back over 2500 years ago to Ancient Egypt, where they produced Foie Gras much like they did today.
             




The Greeks would feed birds and cows figs as would the Romans, while the Chinese had their own special preparations. Either way, Foie Gras remains a favorite world-wide today. Buy French Foie Gras online today, fast shipping from the US straight to your home.

      (1999-2001), of Bath and Body Works, LLC, an international retailer 
      specializing in bath and beauty products.
    

      “It is an honor to be named President of Sally Beauty,” Ms. Leite said. 
      “Sally Beauty has taken great strides to articulate its value 
      proposition to the consumer and improve the in-store shopping 
      experience, resulting in a strong foundation for continued success. I 
      look forward to working with the Sally Beauty executive team and store 
      team. I share their passion for superior customer service and support 
      their initiatives already underway. Given the Company's long-term 
      history in a very resilient industry, I have great confidence that we 
      can continue our growth trajectory and succeed.”

B is for Balance, a guide to creating balance at home and at work
 Available through: Nursing Society and Amazon
Reviews
“A very useful book for people looking for a balance in their busy life. Easy to follow ways to have a meaningful life.”
“Several managers at my healthcare organization are passing around books that are well-written and inspirational. It is fun! We sign the inside cover and make a short comment. This book is currently being circulated and several of my colleagues have said they plan to add this book to their personal library. The inside cover comments have included, “I need to read this more than once!”
“I would encourage anyone who feels that work is taking a larger portion of their life to read this book. It is written by a nurse for nurses but it could benefit anyone who feels their work and home life may be out-of-balance.”
B is for Balance Workbook

Sharon Clark & the Product of Time








Nineteen-year-old Sharon Clark and husband Dennis entered the YoDi stable under Pierre Thigpen’s guidance, drafting songwriter Tyler Ludy and future Georgette Phyllis Boone to form her backing group, The Product of Time. “I’m Not Afraid Of Love,” credited to Sharon Clark & the Product of Time, ushered in lush strings and tightened arrangements that hinted at the act’s chart potential. A slick, multi-colored label was designed to give the 45 more pop in the bins. YoDi owner/producer extraordinaire Allan Merry went down to record in Memphis several times over the course of 1971, but no session was more productive than Sharon Clark & the Product of Time’s stint at Sun. The promise of “I’m Not Afraid Of Love” was delivered in spades on the Ludy-penned “That’s A Good Reason,” a sweeping ballad tinted by subtle strings and a stinging rhythm section. “It’s Not Your Business” was a serviceable side of deep-fried up-tempo blues, but it was the flip that sunk its hooks into Memphis jocks, who drove “That’s A Good Reason” all the way to #8 without a dime dropped in their pockets.

Sharon France






 "My contemporary country landscapes are of the old farms, barns, farmhouses, animals, and quiet rural scenes that I love to paint. The ideas for my paintings come from my imagination, memories, and impressions of the places that I have been and seen here in the Midwestern Heartland."Landscape painter Sharon France's work has been described as "having an intriguing peacefulness in its quiet simplicity." France feels blessed to live on an old farmstead in the Heartland, surrounded by the quiet and peaceful countryside that she loves to paint.France works in both acrylic and oil paint, although she most often works in acrylic on stretched canvas for her original landscapes. She paints by a process of building up many thin layers using both wet and dry brush techniques.France received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Northern Illinois University. Her skill in landscape and animal painting has come from the experience of working to slowly develop her distinctive style over time. France is a juried member of the Society of Animal Artists.
