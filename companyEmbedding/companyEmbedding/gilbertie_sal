About Gilbertie's

Sal Gilbertie is the 3rd generation proprietor of Gilbertie’s Herb Gardens & Petite Edibles in Westport and Easton, CT.  He works the farm to this day together with his wife and children, plus a small team of loyal helpers.  Located in this part of Connecticut for over 90 years, Gilbertie’s grows some of the most beautiful organic microgreens and lettuces we’ve ever seen. 
What’s so special about Gilbertie’s microgreens, herbs and lettuces is that they are all soil-grown. Most microgreens are hydroponically grown – pretty enough but not comparable in flavor. The Gilberties have developed a custom soil blend that originally took 4 years to perfect. They grow more than just microgreens in this magic dirt. Their arugula is out of this world - emerald green with a supple texture and the spicy bite of truly wild arugula.  This certified organic soil ensures that each micro, herb and leaf contains the highest amount of essential oil and taste.  Relying on Integrated Pest Management techniques, they release “beneficial” insects to deal with the “bad bugs”.  The Gilberties are quick to point out that although hydroponically-grown crops are much easier to cultivate, they cannot compare in flavor or nutrition to their soil-grown counterparts
Gilbertie’s Farms provides certified organic products all over the north east. They serve the community through generous donations to local gardens, charities and schools and many free lectures and classes on the importance of growing organically to preserve our world and to eat more healthfully. The Gilbertie’s have also written a book called Cooking With Microgreens.  It tells you everything you could possible want to know about growing microgreens at home, describes every variety under the sun and helps you prepare dishes that feature them.
