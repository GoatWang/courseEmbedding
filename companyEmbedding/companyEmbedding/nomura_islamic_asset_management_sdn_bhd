Nomura Asset Management Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.Nomura Islamic Asset Management Sdn. Bhd.











Nomura Asset Management Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (NAM Malaysia) was incorporated in September 2006, joining the ranks of other top international asset managers' presence in Malaysia, as part of the special scheme for foreign fund management companies introduced by the Securities Commission Malaysia in 2005 to strengthen the Malaysian capital market.
In order to leverage on Malaysia's leadership role in Islamic finance and fund management, we established Nomura Islamic Asset Management Sdn. Bhd. (NIAM) in November 2008 with the ambition to build ourselves as the global Islamic hub for the Nomura Asset Management (NAM) Group.
NAM Malaysia (Company Registration No.: 748695-A) and NIAM (Company Registration No.: 838564-T) are registered as limited companies under the Companies Act (Malaysia) 1965. The offices are licensed under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) for the regulated activity of fund management since December 2006 (NAM Malaysia) and January 2009 (NIAM).  Both NAM Malaysia and NIAM are 100% owned by Nomura Asset Management Singapore Limited (NAMS).



Our investment approach is based on the understanding that markets are not fully efficient and that active management through fundamental research can add value. We consider the best investment approach to be combining both bottom-up and top-down strategies, with a bias towards stock selection, and portfolio risk control techniques should be at the heart of the investment management process. With a team based investment management style, the investment process is structured to rely heavily on the insight we gain from our locally based investment team to add value to our clients' assets.
Over the years, our investment philosophy and disciplined investment process have delivered consistent long-term investment results for our clients.



The establishment of the Malaysian offices aims to strengthen our relationship with our existing and targeted clients in the region. With a variety of clients globally, encompassing pension funds, government agencies and institutional investors, together with our depths of resource worldwide, we are confident that we can tailor our service to suit all our clients' investment requirements. This comprises of global and regional offerings to our clients in the region including the Middle East.
We have an established reputation in Malaysia and are part of the core Asia Pacific ex Japan team responsible for the management of non-Japan Pacific Basin regional equity portfolios as well as marketing and client relationships within the region.  Our capabilities have also expanded over the years to include on the ground investment capabilities in global Islamic equities, global Sukuk and Islamic fixed income securities.
As the global Islamic hub of NAM Group, we have successfully built ourselves as one of the top 20 Islamic fund management companies in the world, based on assets under management (Asian Investor, March 2014) within a short span of time.

 Suite 16-1, Level 16, Menara IMC, No. 8 Jalan Sultan Ismail, 50250 Kuala Lumpur 








 

Nomura Asset Management Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (NAM Malaysia) was incorporated in September 2006, joining the ranks of other top international asset managers’ presence in Malaysia, as part of the special scheme for foreign fund management companies introduced by the Securities Commission Malaysia in 2005 to strengthen the Malaysian capital market.
In order to leverage on Malaysia’s leadership role in Islamic finance and fund management, we established Nomura Islamic Asset Management Sdn. Bhd. (NIAM) in November 2008 with the ambition to build ourselves as the global Islamic hub for the Nomura Asset Management (NAM) Group.
NAM Malaysia (Company Registration No.: 748695-A) and NIAM (Company Registration No.: 838564-T) are registered as limited companies under the Companies Act (Malaysia) 1965. The offices are licensed under the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA) for the regulated activity of fund management since December 2006 (NAM Malaysia) and January 2009 (NIAM). Both NAM Malaysia and NIAM are 100% owned by Nomura Asset Management Singapore Limited (NAMS).

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        BuyerZone.com, LLC has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 6 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
