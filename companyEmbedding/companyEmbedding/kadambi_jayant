Jayant Kadambi, Co-Founder of YuMe, to Take the Helm
 

Michael Mathieu, who led YuMe’s sales growth, to step down from day-to-day, continue to serve on board of directors
 
REDWOOD CITY, CA – August 3, 2011 – YuMe, the leading relevant video advertising technology company, today announced that co-founder Jayant Kadambi has been named CEO as YuMe expands to the next phase of technology growth. Michael Mathieu, who led the company’s revenue growth that outpaced the industry over the past three years, will continue to serve on the Board of Directors and is stepping down from his day-to-day role at the company. Kadambi, who co-founded YuMe and previously served as CEO, will lead YuMe in continuing to build both the media business and technology platform that provides end-to-end software as a service (SaaS) solutions for video that allow publishers and advertisers to reach their audience on any screen — PC, mobile, or connected TV.
 
“I’m excited to take on the role of CEO - it’s clear that the future of video advertising depends on the technology platforms and systems in place for publishers and advertisers to effectively monetize their content," said Jayant Kadambi. “Michael has been an important part of our growth over the last three years and we look forward to continuing to work with him in the future.”
 
YuMe has broadly expanded the reach of the YuMe business and technology platform:

		Serving over 1.5 billion ad impressions per month on its global video ad serving infrastructure;

		Triple digit revenue growth for three consecutive years far outpacing the industry;

		New Relevance Engine-based supply and demand side video infrastructure product offerings;

		Expansion into Europe with the opening of a London office;

		Additionally the company has hired senior executive leadership, including Tim Laehy as CFO, and an experienced team to drive marketing and expansion on mobile platforms.
