Emerging Markets











Our Emerging Markets Equity Strategy seeks to invest in companies located in emerging markets that are exhibiting above-average profitability and earnings growth and are trading at reasonable valuations. Exposure to these companies is gained through the purchase of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and U.S. listed shares of foreign companies. As a result, clients have the opportunity to invest in companies in emerging markets without the operational burdens inherent to owning ordinary shares. Our objective is to outperform comparable international stock indices over a full market cycle.
The Renaissance Emerging Markets Equity Strategy is available as an institutional separate account and through select SMA and UMA platforms.
