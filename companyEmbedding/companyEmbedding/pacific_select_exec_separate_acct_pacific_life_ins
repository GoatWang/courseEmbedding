This and other information about Pacific Life are provided in the product, Pacific Select Fund, and underlying fund prospectuses. These prospectuses are also available from your financial advisor.

For nonqualified contracts, an additional 3.8% federal tax may apply on net investment income. If withdrawals and other distributions are taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% federal tax may apply. Withdrawals may reduce the value of the death benefit and any optional benefits.
