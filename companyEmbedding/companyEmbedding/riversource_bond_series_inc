From the president                                                              

As you read this semiannual report, you'll find it very different from          
those you've received from us in the past. We've made substantial changes       
in the design and organization to make the information easier to find and       
understand.                                                                     

A good place to begin is with the portfolio manager's letter, which             
describes the events and investment strategies that most influenced the         
fund's performance during the past period.                                      

In redesigning the reports, we asked IDS financial planners and some of         
you for suggestions and recommendations. We believe that you'll find the        
results of our work worthwhile.                                                 

William R. Pearce                                                               

From the portfolio manager                                                      

Led by solid gains among its health care and technology holdings, IDS           
Discovery Fund enjoyed a very productive first half of the fiscal year.         
Including the increase in net asset value and distributions, shareholders       
realized a double-digit return during the period.                               

Small growth stocks - stocks of smaller companies that are likely to grow       
rapidly - got off to a strong start in August, the beginning of the             
period. In that month alone, the fund gained approximately 5%. The fund         
continued to enjoy positive, though less robust, performance during             
September and the first part of October.

To our shareholders (continued)                                                 

The next several weeks, however, proved to be a stumbling block, as a           
rise in long-term interest rates drove the stock market, and small stocks       
in particular, down. In November alone, the fund gave back about 4% of          
its previous gain. The market and the fund got back on track quickly,           
though, as both advanced in December and January.                               

Health care recovers                                                            

The initial spark for the fund was provided by health care stocks. Their        
positive performance represented a pleasant turnaround from the first few       
months of 1993, when news of the administration's intention to revamp the       
nation's health care system sent those stocks into a tailspin.                  

By summer, we had decided the worst was over for this sector and began          
selectively adding to the portfolio's health care holdings. Our timing          
proved to be good, as those stocks largely worked in the fund's favor           
throughout the six months. Among the best performers were Zoll Medical,         
which produces medical devices such as heart defibrillators, and Cardinal       
Distribution, which distributes pharmaceuticals.                                

Technology chips in                                                             

Generally sluggish through the first several months of 1993, technology         
stocks (mainly those of telecommunications, electronics and computer            
hardware and software companies) made a decent comeback during the past         
six months. To the fund's benefit, we maintained a substantial exposure         
(approaching 40% of the portfolio) to that group, which has long been           
the largest component of the portfolio. There were several prominent            
performers, including Microchip, a supplier of digital semiconductors,          
and Maxim, which makes analog semiconductors.                                   

Our foreign holdings, although they constituted a relatively small              
portion of the portfolio, also made a positive contribution. Some of            
those stocks, in fact, recorded gains ranging from 50% to more than 100%.       

Also working in the fund's favor during the period was our relatively low       
level of cash reserves, whose return has been negligible in this low            
interest-rate environment. We began reducing cash prior to August,              
bringing it from about 15% of assets to less than 5% by the end of the          
month. By keeping nearly all the assets in stocks and very little in            
cash, the fund's return was enhanced.

To our shareholders (continued)                                                 

At this point, we think the outlook for the market and the fund remains         
reasonably good. Although it's unlikely that the falling-interest-rate          
environment that stocks have benefited from in the past few years will be       
sustained in the months ahead, the market continues to enjoy a healthly         
influx of cash from investors. Naturally, that's good for stocks and,           
therefore, the fund. As for portfolio changes, aside from probably              
increasing our foreign exposure somewhat, we're comfortable with our            
current structure, which we think will allow us to build on our first-          
half progress.

1. Summary of significant accounting policies                                   

                     The fund is registered under the Investment Company
                     Act of 1940 (as amended) as a diversified, open-end
                       management investment company. Significant accounting
                     policies followed by the fund are summarized below:

Valuation of securities       

                All securities are valued at the close of each
             business day. Securities traded on national
                     securities exchanges or included in national market
                    systems are valued at the last quoted sales price;
                securities for which market quotations are not
                      readily available are valued at fair value according
                   to methods selected in good faith by the board of
                  directors. Determination of fair value involves,
                  among other things, reference to market indexes,
             matrixes and data from independent brokers.
                     Short-term securities maturing in more than 60 days
                  from the valuation date are valued at the market
                    price or approximate market value based on current
                       interest rates; those maturing in 60 days or less are
valued at amortized cost.     

Options transactions          

                   In order to produce incremental earnings, protect
             gains, and facilitate buying and selling of
                      securities for investment purposes, the fund may buy
                      and sell put and call options and write covered call
               options on portfolio securities and may write
                      cash-secured put options. The risk in writing a call
                     option is that the fund gives up the opportunity of
                       profit if the market price of the security increases.
                       The risk in writing a put option is that the fund may
                  incur a loss if the market price of the security
                    decreases and the option is exercised. The risk in
                  buying an option is that the fund pays a premium
                       whether or not the option is exercised. The fund also
                    has the additional risk of not being able to enter
                  into a closing transaction if a liquid secondary
market does not exist.

                  Option contracts are valued daily at the closing
                  prices on their primary exchanges and unrealized
                    appreciation or depreciation is recorded. The fund
                will realize a gain or loss upon expiration or
                      closing of the option transaction. When an option is
                     exercised, the proceeds on sales for a written call
                       option, the purchase cost for a written put option or
                    the cost of a security for a purchased put or call
                      option is adjusted by the amount of premium received
or paid.                      

   Foreign currency translations and
    forward foreign currency contracts

             Securities and other assets and liabilities
                  denominated in foreign currencies are translated
                daily into U.S. dollars at the closing rate of
                   exchange. Foreign currency amounts related to the
               purchase or sale of securities and income and
                     expenses are translated at the exchange rate on the
                     transaction date. It is not practicable to identify
                     that portion of realized and unrealized gain (loss)
                     arising from changes in the exchange rates from the
                     portion arising from changes in the market value of
investments.                  

                  The fund may enter into forward foreign currency
                    exchange contracts for operational purposes and to
                    protect against adverse exchange rate fluctuation.
               The net U.S. dollar value of foreign currency
                    underlying all contractual commitments held by the
                   fund and the resulting unrealized appreciation or
                    depreciation are determined using foreign currency
                     exchange rates from an independent pricing service.
                       The fund is subject to the credit risk that the other
                party will not complete the obligations of the
contract.                     

Federal taxes                 

               Since the fund's policy is to comply with all
                     sections of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to
                      regulated investment companies and to distribute all
                     of its taxable income to shareholders, no provision
         for income or excise taxes is required.

                     Net investment income (loss) and net realized gains
                     (losses) may differ for financial statement and tax
                      purposes primarily because of the deferral of losses
                  on certain futures contracts, the recognition of
                     certain foreign currency gains (losses) as ordinary
                     income (loss) for tax purposes, and losses deferred
                   due to "wash sale" transactions. The character of
             distributions made during the year from net
                    investment income or net realized gains may differ
                  from their ultimate characterization for federal
                 income tax purposes. Also, due to the timing of
                  dividend distributions, the fiscal year in which
                       amounts are distributed may differ from the year that
                     the income or realized gains (losses) were recorded
by the fund.                  

Dividends to shareholders     

                    An annual dividend declared and paid at the end of
                 the calendar year from net investment income is
                    reinvested in additional shares of the fund at net
                     asset value or payable in cash. Capital gains, when
                  available, are distributed along with the income
dividend.                     

Other                         

                     Security transactions are accounted for on the date
                      securities are purchased or sold. Dividend income is
                 recognized on the ex-dividend date and interest
                       income, including level-yield amortization of premium
 and discount, is accrued daily.

2. Expenses and sales charges                                                   

                      Under terms of an agreement dated Nov. 14, 1991, the
                     fund pays IDS Financial Corporation (IDS) a fee for
                   managing its investments, recordkeeping and other
                    specified services. The fee is a percentage of the
                       fund's average daily net assets consisting of a group
                    asset charge in reducing percentages from 0.46% to
                  0.32% annually on the combined net assets of all
                     non-money market funds in the IDS MUTUAL FUND GROUP
                   and an individual annual asset charge of 0.23% of
                      average daily net assets. The fee is adjusted upward
                   or downward by a performance incentive adjustment
                     based on the fund's average daily net assets over a
                 rolling 12-month period as measured against the
                       change in the Lipper Small Company Growth Fund Index.
                       The maximum adjustment is 0.12% of the fund's average
              daily net assets after deducting 1% from the
                       performance difference. If the performance difference
                   is less than 1%, the adjustment will be zero. The
                     adjustment decreased the fee by $89,551 for the six
months ended Jan. 31, 1994.   

                 The fund also pays IDS a distribution fee at an
                 annual rate of $6 per shareholder account and a
                  transfer agency fee at an annual rate of $15 per
                 shareholder account. The transfer agency fee is
                   reduced by earnings on monies pending shareholder
redemptions.                  

                    IDS will assume and pay any expenses (except taxes
                 and brokerage commissions) that exceed the most
                  restrictive applicable state expense limitation.

                  Sales charges by IDS Financial Services Inc. for
                      distributing fund shares were $1,374,749 for the six
                months ended Jan. 31, 1994. The fund also pays
                     custodian fees to IDS Bank & Trust, an affiliate of
IDS.                          

                    The fund has a retirement plan for its independent
                       directors. Upon retirement, directors receive monthly
                       payments equal to one-half of the retainer fee for as
                   many months as they served as directors up to 120
                      months. There are no death benefits. The plan is not
                     funded but the fund recognizes the cost of payments
                   during the time the directors serve on the board.
                    The retirement plan expense amounted to $1,171 for
     the six months ended Jan. 31, 1994.

                Realized gains and losses are determined on an
identified cost basis.        

                       Brokerage commissions paid to brokers affiliated with
                    IDS were $18,632 for the six months ended Jan. 31,

5. Lending of portfolio securities                                              

                   At Jan. 31, 1994, securities valued at $3,413,000
                   were on loan to brokers. For collateral, the fund
                     received $3,542,000 in cash. Income from securities
                      lending amounted to $37,478 for the six months ended
                    Jan. 31, 1994. The risks to the fund of securities
               lending are that the borrower may not provide
                   additional collateral when required or return the
securities when due.

(See "The Fund's Long-term Performance" for Index descriptions)                 

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a      
guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of your  
investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more 
or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher    
than the performance information shown. You may obtain performance information  
current to the most recent month-end by contacting your financial institution or
visiting riversource.com/funds.                                                 

The 3.00% sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund, which changed  
from 4.75% effective March 3, 2008, is not reflected in the table above. If     
reflected, returns would be lower than those shown. The performance of other    
classes may vary from that shown because of differences in expenses. See the    
Average Annual Total Returns table for performance of other share classes of the
Fund.                                                                           

The index does not reflect the effects of sales charges, expenses and taxes.    

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.                              

(a) Fund data is from Feb. 16, 2006. Credit Suisse First Boston Leveraged Loan

The style matrix can be a valuable tool for constructing and monitoring your    
portfolio. It provides a frame of reference for distinguishing the types of     
stocks or bonds owned by a mutual fund, and may serve as a guideline for helping
you build a portfolio.                                                          

Investment products, including shares of mutual funds, are not federally or     
FDIC-insured, are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed by any financial
institution, and involve investment risks including possible loss of principal  
and fluctuation in value.

(a) The Investment Manager and its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive
certain fees and to absorb certain expenses until July 31, 2009, unless 
    sooner terminated by discretion of the Fund's Board. Any amounts waived will

 (excluding fees and expenses of acquired funds) will not exceed 1.01% for
   Class A, 1.77% for Class B, 1.76% for Class C, 0.70% for Class I, 0.94% for

(b) Inception date for Class R5 is July 24, 2008.                               

(1) WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE measures a bond's maturity, which takes into          
  consideration the possibility that the issuer may call the bond before its
maturity date.                                                          
(2) WEIGHTED AVERAGE LOAN AND BOND RATING represents the average credit quality 
of the underlying loans and bonds in the portfolio.                     

The Floating Rate Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans, the market     
value of which may fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. The principal
risks of investing in the Fund include liquidity risk, interest rate risk,      
credit risk, counterparty risk, highly leveraged transactions risk, derivatives 
risk, confidential information access risk, and impairment of collateral risk.  
Generally, when interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities fall,
however, securities or loans with floating interest rates can be less sensitive 
to interest rate changes, but they may decline in value if their interest rates 
do not rise as much as interest rates in general. Limited liquidity may affect  
the ability of the Fund to purchase or sell floating rate loans and may have a  
negative impact on fund performance. The floating rate loans and securities in  
which the fund invests generally are lower-rated (non-investment grade) and are 
more likely to experience a default, which results in more volatile prices and  
more risk to principal and income than investment grade loans or securities. See
the Fund's prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with  
the Fund.

On March 3, 2008, the maximum sales charge for Class A shares changed from 4.75%
to 3.00%. Class A share performance reflects the maximum sales charge of 4.75%, 
which was in effect at the beginning of all periods. Class B share performance  
reflects a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) applied as follows: first    
year 5%; second and third years 4%; fourth year 3%; fifth year 2%; sixth year   
1%; no sales charge thereafter. Class C shares may be subject to a 1% CDSC if   
shares are sold within one year after purchase. Sales charges do not apply to   
Class I, Class R4, and Class W shares. Class I and Class R4 are available to    
institutional investors only. Class W shares are offered through qualifying     
discretionary accounts.

MANAGER COMMENTARY -------------------------------------------------------------

At July 31, 2008, approximately 38% of the Fund's shares were owned in the      
aggregate by affiliated funds-of-funds managed by RiverSource Investments, LLC  
(RiverSource). As a result of asset allocation decisions by RiverSource, it is  
possible that RiverSource Floating Rate Fund may experience relatively large    
purchases or redemptions from affiliated funds-of-funds (see page 49, Class I   
capital share transactions for related activity during the most recent fiscal   
period). RiverSource seeks to minimize the impact of these transactions by      
structuring them over a reasonable period of time. RiverSource Floating Rate    
Fund may experience increased expenses as it buys and sells securities as a     
result of purchases or redemptions by affiliated funds-of-funds. For more       
information of the Fund's expenses, see the discussions beginning on pages 12   
and 46.                                                                         

Dear Shareholders:                                                              

RiverSource Floating Rate Fund (the Fund) Class A shares declined 1.85%         
(excluding sales charge) for the 12 months ended July 31, 2008. The Fund        
underperformed its benchmark, the unmanaged Credit Suisse First Boston Leveraged
Loan Index (CSFB Index), which fell 1.06% during the same period.

Ratings apply to the underlying holdings of the Fund and not the Fund itself.   
Whenever possible, the Standard and Poor's rating is used to determine the      
credit quality of a security. Standard and Poor's rates the creditworthiness of 
loans and bonds, with 15 categories, ranging from AAA (highest) to D (lowest).  
Ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus   
(-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. If       
Standard and Poor's doesn't rate a security, then Moody's rating is used.       
RiverSource Investments, LLC, the Fund's investment manager, rates a security   
using an internal rating system when Moody's doesn't provide a rating.          

SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE FACTORS                                                 
Floating rate assets, including leveraged bank loans, struggled through the     
annual period overall, as did the Fund's performance. In late July 2007, an     
unprecedented and dramatic dislocation in the credit markets began. This        
dislocation continued and accelerated through the rest of 2007 and into the     
first half of 2008, despite several brief rallies during the fiscal year. The   
fixed income markets in general -- and high yield debt instruments

and leveraged bank loans in particular -- rallied in October 2007 and then again
in April and May 2008. A floating rate debt instrument is a bond or loan whose  
interest rate floats based on a market interest rate plus a premium. The        
floating rate asset's interest rate resets periodically to incorporate changes  
in the market rate. This compares to a fixed rate debt instrument, which is an  
asset with a fixed interest rate whose value can fluctuate based solely on the  
direction of market rates.                                                      

Through much of the year, turmoil in the subprime mortgage market spilled over  
into other parts of the debt and credit markets. Declining trends in loan prices
and high yield debt overall triggered an increasing numbers of sellers in a     
downward spiral of selling pressure. The large money-center banks and investment
banks attempted to bring to market a number of previously underwritten loan and 
high yield bond offerings to little avail. Following the April and May 2008     
rally, during which the turmoil that engulfed the capital markets abated        
somewhat, the markets turned decidedly bearish again. Such bearishness re-      
surfaced as credit write-offs at banks exceeded earlier expectations, oil prices
were materially higher than a year prior despite modest late-period declines,   
unemployment rates escalated and the housing market continued to decline. In    
addition, problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government seizure of Indy
Mac, and ongoing problems of the monoline insurance companies weighed on        
investor confidence and increased pressure on the economic system as a whole.   

Several other factors caused the high yield loan market to struggle in the last 
months of the annual                                                            

 We currently intend to continue to maintain the Fund's exposure to the higher
quality segments of the leveraged bank loan and high yield floating rate    
universe.

period. Although the technical overhang of loans underwritten during the first  
half of 2007 was reduced materially over the 12-month reporting period, demand  
remained tepid. For example, the market for new collateralized loan obligations 
(CLOs), a major source of demand in the loan market for the last several years, 
remained largely inaccessible. Mutual fund demand was generally flat to down,   
and the banks were hesitant to put their own capital at risk. These weak        
technical factors, along with increasingly disconcerting credit fundamentals,   
continued putting pressure on high yield loan prices.                           

CHANGES TO THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO                                                 
We increased the Fund's position in cash and cash alternatives during the annual
period given heightened market volatility and our expectation that such         
volatility will continue over the remainder of the year. Higher cash balances   
also enabled us to take advantage of the heightened volatility by identifying   
and purchasing what we believed to be attractive loans and other securities on a
relative value basis when opportunities presented themselves. While we focused  
on the higher quality segments of the leveraged bank loan and high yield debt   
markets throughout the period, we moved to purchasing a slightly higher quality 
mix of assets as the fiscal year progressed, given our belief that the next six 
to 12 months will likely continue to present economic challenges.               

OUR FUTURE STRATEGY                                                             
We currently intend to continue to maintain the Fund's exposure to the higher   
quality segments of the leveraged bank loan and high yield floating rate        
universe. Given that we expect the high yield debt market, along with the       
broader fixed income market, to be quite volatile over the remainder of the     
year, we further intend to hold higher cash balances in the Fund than we have   
over the past few years. At the same time, should opportunities present         
themselves, we may continue to cautiously deploy some of the Fund's cash        
balances over the near term given the recent decline in high yield loan prices. 
Indeed, although we believe that corporate defaults will likely increase over   
the coming year due to the weak economy, there are still pockets of value in the
leveraged bank loan universe in our view. Certain industries, such as health    
care and technology, for example, appear to be somewhat insulated from the      
general economic malaise. Also, while we generally remain concerned

about inflation and the weak U.S. dollar, certain credits in the high yield     
floating rate universe have benefited from this scenario. We intend to continue 
seeking to take advantage of these types of opportunistic situations over the   
next few quarters.                                                              

Regardless of economic or market conditions, we will continue to invest in a    
diversified portfolio of senior secured floating rate loans and bonds, as we    
seek to provide a high level of current income and, as a secondary objective,   
preserve capital.

THE FUND'S LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE -----------------------------------------------

The chart on the facing page illustrates the total value of an assumed $10,000  
investment in RiverSource Floating Rate Fund Class A shares (from 3/1/06 to     
7/31/08)* as compared to the performance of a widely cited performance index,   
the Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) Leveraged Loan Index. In comparing the    
Fund's Class A shares to this index, you should take into account the fact that 
the Fund's performance reflects a maximum sales charge of 4.75%, which changed  
to 3.00% effective March 3, 2008. Such charges are not reflected in the         
performance of the index. Returns for the Fund include the reinvestment of any  
distribution paid during each period.                                           

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a      
guarantee of future results. The table below and the chart on the facing page do
not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund         
distributions or the redemption of fund shares. The investment return and       
principal value of your investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when     
redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current           
performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. You  
may obtain performance information current to the most recent month-end by

FUND EXPENSES EXAMPLE ----------------------------------------------------------
(UNAUDITED)                                                                     

As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction     
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase payments; and (2) ongoing    
costs, which may include management fees; distribution and service (12b-1) fees;
and other Fund fees and expenses. This example is intended to help you          
understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to      
compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.  
In addition to the ongoing expenses which the Fund bears directly, the Fund's   
shareholders indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which it invests (also
referred to as "acquired funds"), including affiliated and non-affiliated pooled
investment vehicles (including mutual funds and exchange traded funds). The     
Fund's indirect expense from investing in the acquired funds is based on the    
Fund's pro rata portion of the cumulative expenses charged by the acquired funds
using the expense ratio of each of the acquired funds as of the acquired fund's 
most recent shareholder report.                                                 

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period indicated and held until July 31, 2008.                                  

ACTUAL EXPENSES                                                                 
The first line of the table provides information about actual account values and
actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together with the    
amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period.    
Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value
divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first   
line under the heading titled "Expenses paid during the period" to estimate the 
expenses you paid on your account during this period.                           

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES                                    
The second line of the table provides information about hypothetical account    
values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and an
assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Fund's  
actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to  
estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. 
You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the   
Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5%
hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your    
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales    
charges (loads). Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing 
ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of 
owning different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included,
your costs would have been higher.

(a) Class R5 beginning account value is as of July 25, 2008 (when Class R5      
commenced operations) for actual expense calculations, and as of Feb. 1,
2008 for hypothetical expense calculations.                             
(b) Expenses are equal to the Fund's annualized expense ratio as indicated      
  above, multiplied by the average account value over the period, multiplied
  by 182/366 (to reflect the one-half year period). Class R5 actual expenses
  are equal to the annualized expense ratio for Class R5 as indicated above,
    multiplied by the average account value over the period, multiplied by 7/366
(to reflect the period from July 25, 2008 to July 31, 2008).            
(c) Based on the actual return for the six months ended July 31, 2008: +0.06%   
for Class A, -0.32% for Class B, -0.32% for Class C, +0.11% for Class I,
+0.23% for Class R4 and -0.10% for Class W.                             
(d) The Investment Manager and its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive
certain fees and to absorb certain expenses until July 31, 2009, unless 
sooner terminated at the discretion of the Fund's Board, such that net  
expenses (excluding fees and expenses of acquired funds) will not exceed
   1.01% for Class A, 1.77% for Class B, 1.76% for Class C, 0.70% for Class I,
 0.94% for Class R4, 0.75% for Class R5 and 1.15% for Class W. Any amounts
    waived will not be reimbursed by the Fund. This change was effective Aug. 1,
2008. Had this change been in effect the entire six month period ended July
31, 2008, the actual expenses paid would have been: $5.02 for Class A, $8.79
    for Class B, $8.74 for Class C, $3.48 for Class I and $5.72 for Class W; the
hypothetical expenses paid would have been $5.07 for Class A, $8.87 for 
Class B, $8.82 for Class C, $3.52 for Class I and $5.77 for Class W. The
  actual and hypothetical expenses paid for Class R4 and Class R5 would have
been the same as those expenses presented in the table above.           
(e) Based on the actual return for Class R5 of -0.04% for the period from July
25, 2008 to July 31, 2008.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS                                               

(a)  Securities are valued by using procedures described in Note 1 to the       
financial statements.                                                 

(b)  Adjustable rate mortgage; interest rate varies to reflect current market   
conditions; rate shown is the effective rate on July 31, 2008.        

(c)  Foreign security values are stated in U.S. dollars. For debt securities,   
    principal amounts are denominated in U.S. dollar currency unless otherwise
   noted. At July 31, 2008, the value of foreign securities represented 3.6%
of net assets.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS (CONTINUED)                                   

(d)  Represents a security sold under Rule 144A, which is exempt from           
  registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This security
   may be determined to be liquid under guidelines established by the Fund's
   Board of Directors. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt
    from registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers. At July 31,
2008, the value of these securities amounted to $6,258,442 or 1.3% of net
assets.                                                               

(e)  Interest rate varies either based on a predetermined schedule or to reflect
 current market conditions; rate shown is the effective rate on July 31,
2008.                                                                 

(f)  Mortgage-backed securities represent direct or indirect participations in, 
or are secured by and payable from, mortgage loans secured by real    
   property, and include single- and multi-class pass-through securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. These securities may be issued or
    guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities, or by private
   issuers, generally originators and investors in mortgage loans, including
savings associations, mortgage bankers, commercial banks, investment  
  bankers and special purpose entities. The maturity dates shown represent
 the original maturity of the underlying obligation. Actual maturity may
    vary based upon prepayment activity on these obligations. Unless otherwise
noted, the coupon rates presented are fixed rates.                    

(g)  At July 31, 2008, the cost of securities purchased, including interest     
purchased, on a when-issued and/or other forward-commitment basis was 
$16,203,332. See Note 1 to the financial statements.                  

(h)  Represents a senior loan purchased on a when-issued or delayed-delivery    
     basis. Certain details associated with this purchase are not known prior to
     the settlement date of the transaction. In addition, senior loans typically
     trade without accrued interest and therefore a weighted average coupon rate
    is not available prior to settlement. At settlement, if still unknown, the
borrower or counterparty will provide the Fund with the final weighted
average coupon rate and maturity date.                                

(i)  Senior loans have rates of interest that float periodically based primarily
    on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and other short-term rates.
     Remaining maturities of senior loans may be less than the stated maturities
   shown as a result of contractual or optional prepayments by the borrower.
Such prepayments cannot be predicted with certainty.                  

(j)  The following abbreviation is used in the portfolio security description to
identify the insurer of the issue:                                    

FSA -- Financial Security Assurance                                   

(k)  The borrower filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Federal     
bankruptcy code.                                                      

(l)  At July 31, 2008, $23,400 was held in a margin deposit account as          
   collateral to cover initial margin deposits on open interest rate futures
contracts.                                                            

(m)  Affiliated Money Market Fund -- See Note 5 to the financial statements. The
rate shown is the seven-day current annualized yield at July 31, 2008.

(n)  At July 31, 2008, the Fund had unfunded senior loan commitments pursuant to
 the terms of the loan agreement. The Fund receives a stated coupon rate
 until the borrower draws on the loan commitment, at which time the rate
will become the stated rate in the loan agreement.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                   

RiverSource Floating Rate Fund (the Fund) is a series of RiverSource Bond       
Series, Inc. and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (as     
amended) as a diversified, open-end management investment company. RiverSource  
Bond Series, Inc. has 10 billion authorized shares of capital stock that can be 
allocated among the separate series as designated by the Board of Directors (the
Board). The Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans and other floating    
rate debt securities. These debt obligations will generally be rated non-       
investment grade by recognized rating agencies (similar to "junk bonds") or be  
considered by the investment manager to be of comparable quality.               

The Fund offers Class A, Class B, Class C, Class I, Class R4 and Class W shares.

-  Class A shares are sold with a front-end sales charge.                       

-  Class B shares may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC)   
and automatically convert to Class A shares during the ninth year of      
ownership. Effective March 3, 2008, Class B shares were closed to new     
investors and new purchases.                                              

-  Class C shares may be subject to a CDSC.                                     

-  Class I and Class R4 shares are sold without a front-end sales charge or CDSC
and are offered to qualifying institutional investors.                    

-  Class W shares are sold without a front-end sales charge or CDSC and are     
offered through qualifying discretionary accounts.                        

Effective Aug. 1, 2008, the Fund offers an additional class of shares, Class R5,
to certain institutional investors. These shares are sold without a front-end   
sales charge or CDSC. On July 24, 2008, RiverSource Investments, LLC            
(RiverSource Investments or the Investment Manager) purchased 556 shares at     
$8.99 per share, which represented the initial capital in Class R5.             

At July 31, 2008, RiverSource Investments and the RiverSource affiliated funds- 
of-funds owned 100% of Class I shares and the Investment Manager owned 100% of  
Class R5 and Class W shares. The Investment Manager and the affiliated funds-of-
funds owned approximately 38% of the total outstanding Fund shares.             

All classes of shares have identical voting, dividend and liquidation rights.   
Class specific expenses (e.g. distribution and service fees, transfer agency    
fees, plan administration services fees) differ among classes. Income, expenses 
(other than class specific expenses) and realized and unrealized gains or losses
on investments are allocated to each class of shares based upon its relative net
assets.

The Fund's significant accounting policies are summarized below:                

USE OF ESTIMATES                                                                
Preparing financial statements that conform to U.S. generally accepted          
accounting principles requires management to make estimates (e.g., on assets,   
liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities) that could differ from actual
results.                                                                        

VALUATION OF SECURITIES 
All securities are valued at the close of each business day. Securities traded  
on national securities exchanges or included in national market systems are     
valued at the last quoted sales price. Debt securities are generally traded in  
the over-the-counter market and are valued at a price that reflects fair value  
as quoted by dealers in these securities or by an independent pricing service.  
Foreign securities are valued based on quotations from the principal market in  
which such securities are normally traded. The procedures adopted by the Board  
generally contemplate the use of fair valuation in the event that price         
quotations or valuations are not readily available, price quotations or         
valuations from other sources are not reflective of market value and thus deemed
unreliable, or a significant event has occurred in relation to a security or    
class of securities (such as foreign securities) that is not reflected in price 
quotations or valuations from other sources. A fair value price is a good faith 
estimate of the value of a security at a given point in time.                   

Many securities markets and exchanges outside the U.S. close prior to the close 
of the New York Stock Exchange and therefore the closing prices for securities  
in such markets or on such exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur    
after such close but before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, including 
significant movements in the U.S. market after foreign exchanges have closed.   
Accordingly, in those situations, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise        
Financial), parent company of the Investment Manager, as administrator to the   
Fund, will fair value foreign securities pursuant to procedures adopted by the  
Board, including utilizing a third party pricing service to determine these fair
values. These procedures take into account multiple factors, including movements
in the U.S. securities markets, to determine a good faith estimate that         
reasonably reflects the current market conditions as of the close of the New    
York Stock Exchange.                                                            

Short-term securities maturing in more than 60 days from the valuation date are 
valued at the market price or approximate market value based on current interest
rates; those maturing in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.          

INVESTMENTS IN LOANS                                                            
The senior loans acquired by the Fund typically take the form of a direct       
lending relationship with the borrower acquired through an assignment of another
lender's interest in a loan. The lead lender in a typical corporate loan        
syndicate

administers the loan and monitors collateral. In the event that the lead lender 
becomes insolvent, enters FDIC receivership, or, if not FDIC insured, enters    
into bankruptcy, the Fund may incur certain costs and delays in realizing       
payment, or may suffer a loss of principal and/or interest.                     

Loans are typically secured but may be unsecured. The primary risk arising from 
investing in subordinated loans or in unsecured loans is the potential loss in  
the event of default by the issuer of the loans.                                

SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A FORWARD-COMMITMENT BASIS AND UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS
Delivery and payment for securities that have been purchased by the Fund on a   
forward-commitment basis, including when-issued securities and other forward-   
commitments, can take place one month or more after the transaction date. During
this period, such securities are subject to market fluctuations, and they may   
affect the Fund's net assets the same as owned securities. The Fund designates  
cash or liquid securities at least equal to the amount of its forward-          
commitments. At July 31, 2008, the Fund has outstanding when-issued securities  
of $6,436,477 and other forward-commitments of $9,766,855.                      

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the        
borrower's discretion. These commitments are disclosed in the "Portfolio of     
Investments." At July 31, 2008, the Fund has entered into unfunded loan         
commitments of $9,580,818.                                                      

The Fund also enters into transactions to sell purchase commitments to third    
parties at current market values and concurrently acquires other purchase       
commitments for similar securities at later dates. As an inducement for the Fund
to "roll over" its purchase commitments, the Fund receives negotiated amounts in
the form of reductions of the purchase price of the commitment. The Fund records
the incremental difference between the forward purchase and sale of each forward
roll as realized gain or loss. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of  
the securities or if a counterparty does not perform under the terms of the     
agreement. If a counterparty files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the     
Fund's right to repurchase or sell securities may be limited. The Fund did not  
enter into any mortgage dollar roll transactions during the year ended July 31,
2008.                                                                           

OPTION TRANSACTIONS                                                             
To produce incremental earnings, protect gains, and facilitate buying and       
selling of securities for investments, the Fund may buy and write options traded
on any U.S. or foreign exchange or in the over-the-counter market where         
completing the obligation depends upon the credit standing of the other party.  
Cash collateral may be collected by the Fund to secure certain over-the-counter 
options trades. Cash collateral held by the Fund for such option trades must be 
returned to the

counterparty upon closure, exercise or expiration of the contract. The Fund also
may buy and sell put and call options and write covered call options on         
portfolio securities as well as write cash-secured put options. The risk in     
writing a call option is that the Fund gives up the opportunity for profit if   
the market price of the security increases. The risk in writing a put option is 
that the Fund may incur a loss if the market price of the security decreases and
the option is exercised. The risk in buying an option is that the Fund pays a   
premium whether or not the option is exercised. The Fund also has the additional
risk of being unable to enter into a closing transaction if a liquid secondary  
market does not exist.                                                          

Option contracts are valued daily at the closing prices on their primary        
exchanges and unrealized appreciation or depreciation is recorded. The Fund will
realize a gain or loss when the option transaction expires or closes. When      
options on debt securities or futures are exercised, the Fund will realize a    
gain or loss. When other options are exercised, the proceeds on sales for a     
written call option, the purchase cost for a written put option or the cost of a
security for a purchased put or call option is adjusted by the amount of premium
received or paid. At July 31, 2008, and for the year then ended, the Fund had no
outstanding option contracts.                                                   

FUTURES TRANSACTIONS                                                            
To gain exposure to or protect itself from market changes, the Fund may buy and 
sell financial futures contracts traded on any U.S or foreign exchange. The Fund
also may buy and write put and call options on these futures contracts. Risks of
entering into futures contracts and related options include the possibility of  
an illiquid market and that a change in the value of the contract or option may 
not correlate with changes in the value of the underlying securities.           

Futures are valued daily upon the last sale price a the close of market on the  
principal exchange on which they are traded. Upon entering into a futures       
contract, the Fund is required to deposit either cash or securities in an amount
(initial margin) equal to a certain percentage of the contract value. Subsequent
payments (variation margin) are made or received by the Fund each day. The      
variation margin payments are equal to the daily changes in the contract value  
and are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. The Fund recognizes a realized 
gain or loss when the contract is closed or expires.                            

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS AND FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS 
Securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies   
are translated daily into U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts related to the 
purchase or sale of securities and income and expenses are translated at the    
exchange rate on the transaction date. The effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates on realized and unrealized security gains or losses is reflected as a     
component of such gains or losses. In the Statement of Operations, net realized 
gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, if any, may arise from sales
of foreign currency, closed forward contracts, exchange gains or losses realized

between the trade date and settlement date on securities transactions, and other
translation gains or losses on dividends, interest income and foreign           
withholding taxes.                                                              

The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for operational      
purposes and to protect against adverse exchange rate fluctuation. The net U.S. 
dollar value of foreign currency underlying all contractual commitments held by 
the Fund and the resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation are          
determined using foreign currency exchange rates from an independent pricing    
service. The Fund is subject to the credit risk that the other party will not   
complete its contract obligations.                                              

GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS                                                 
Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are       
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their 
duties to the Fund. In addition, certain of the Fund's contracts with its       
service providers contain general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum   
exposure under these arrangements is unknown since the amount of any future     
claims that may be made against the Fund cannot be determined and the Fund has  
no historical basis for predicting the likelihood of any such claims.           

FEDERAL TAXES                                                                   
The Fund's policy is to comply with Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code   
that applies to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially  
all of its taxable income to shareholders. No provision for income or excise    
taxes is thus required.                                                         

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation 48 (FIN 48),         
"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," clarifies the accounting for      
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB Statement 109,   
"Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 prescribes a two-step process to recognize
and measure a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The   
first step is to determine whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than- 
not recognition threshold and the second step is to measure a tax position that 
meets the threshold to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. Management 
of the Fund has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions 
that would require recognition in the financial statements. Generally, the tax  
authorities can examine all the tax returns filed for the last three years.     

Net investment income (loss) and net realized gains (losses) may differ for     
financial statement and tax purposes primarily because of futures contracts,    
post-October losses and losses deferred due to wash sales. The character of     
distributions made during the year from net investment income or net realized   
gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for federal income tax    
purposes. Also, due to the timing of dividend distributions, the fiscal year in

which amounts are distributed may differ from the year that the income or       
realized gains (losses) were recorded by the Fund.                              

On the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, as a result of permanent book-to-tax
differences, undistributed net investment income has been decreased by $431,348 
and accumulated net realized loss has been decreased by $431,348.               

The tax character of distributions paid for the years indicated is as follows:

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS                                                
In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  
161 (SFAS 161), "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging           
Activities -- an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," which requires enhanced  
disclosures about a fund's derivative and hedging activities. Funds are required
to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why a fund uses derivative    
instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are        
accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how       
derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a fund's financial       
position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for      
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
Nov. 15, 2008. As of July 31, 2008, management does not believe the adoption of 
SFAS 161 will impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional       
footnote disclosures may be required about the use of derivative instruments and
hedging items.                                                                  

On Sept. 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes an           
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a hierarchy for measuring fair 
value, and requires additional disclosures about the inputs used to develop the 
measurements of fair value and the effect of certain measurements reported in   
the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period. The application of SFAS 157    
will be effective for the Fund's fiscal year beginning Aug. 1, 2008. The        
adoption of SFAS 157 is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Fund's 
financial statements; however, additional disclosures will be required about the
inputs used to develop the measurements of fair value and the effect of certain 
measurements reported in the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period.       

DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                       
Dividends from net investment income, declared daily and payable monthly, when  
available, are reinvested in additional shares of the Fund at net asset value or
payable in cash. Capital gains, when available, are distributed along with the  
last income dividend of the calendar year.                                      

OTHER                                                                           
Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities are purchased or 
sold. Interest income, including amortization of premium, market discount and   
original issue discount using the effective interest method, is accrued daily.  
The

Fund recognizes certain facility fees as income over the expected term of the   
loan. The Fund may place a debt security on non-accrual status and reduce       
related interest income when it becomes probable that the interest will not be  
collected and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated. 
A defaulted debt security is removed from non-accrual status when the issuer    
resumes interest payments or when collectibility of interest is reasonable      
assured.                                                                        

2. EXPENSES AND SALES CHARGES                                                   
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FEES                                             
Under an Investment Management Services Agreement, the Investment Manager       
determines which securities will be purchased, held or sold. The management fee 
is a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets that declines from 0.61% 
to 0.38% annually as the Fund's assets increase. The management fee for the year
ended July 31, 2008 was 0.61% of the Fund's average daily net assets.           

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FEES                                                    
Under an Administrative Services Agreement, the Fund pays Ameriprise Financial a
fee for administration and accounting services at a percentage of the Fund's    
average daily net assets that declines from 0.07% to 0.04% annually as the      
Fund's assets increase. The fee for the year ended July 31, 2008 was 0.07% of   
the Fund's average daily net assets.                                            

OTHER FEES                                                                      
Other expenses are for, among other things, certain expenses of the Fund or the 
Board including: Fund boardroom and office expense, employee compensation,      
employee health and retirement benefits, and certain other expenses. Payment of 
these Fund and Board expenses is facilitated by a company providing limited     
administrative services to the Fund and the Board. For the year ended July 31,
2008, other expenses paid to this company were $2,302.                          

COMPENSATION OF BOARD MEMBERS                                                   
Compensation of Board members includes, for a former Board Chair, compensation  
as well as retirement benefits. Certain other aspects of a former Board Chair's 
compensation, including health benefits and payment of certain other expenses,  
are included under other expenses.                                              

Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), non-interested board members may 
defer receipt of their compensation. Deferred amounts are treated as though     
equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the Fund or other      
RiverSource funds. The Fund's liability for these amounts is adjusted for market
value changes and remains in the Fund until distributed in accordance with the  
Plan.

TRANSFER AGENCY FEES

average daily net assets attributable to Class R4 and Class R5 shares and an    
annual asset-based fee at a rate of 0.20% of the Fund's average daily net assets
attributable to Class W shares.                                                 

The Transfer Agent charges an annual fee of $5 per inactive account, charged on 
a pro rata basis for 12 months from the date the account becomes inactive. These
fees are included in the transfer agency fees on the Statement of Operations.   

PLAN ADMINISTRATION SERVICES FEES                                               
Under a Plan Administration Services Agreement with the Transfer Agent, the Fund
pays an annual fee at a rate of 0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets    
attributable to Class R4 shares for the provision of various administrative,    
recordkeeping, communication and educational services.                          

DISTRIBUTION FEES                                                               
The Fund has an agreement with RiverSource Distributors, Inc. (the Distributor) 
for distribution and shareholder services. Prior to Oct. 1, 2007, Ameriprise

net assets attributable to Class A and Class W shares, and a fee at an annual   
rate of up to 1.00% of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class

reimbursed for distribution expenses.                                           

The amount of distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor and not yet     
reimbursed ("unreimbursed expense") was approximately $1,219,000 and $119,000   
for Class B and Class C shares, respectively. These amounts are based on the    
most recent information available as of July 31, 2008. These amounts may be     
recovered from future payments under the distribution plan or CDSC. To the      
extent the unreimbursed expense has been fully recovered, the distribution fee  
is reduced.

* In addition to the fees and expenses which the Fund bears directly, the Fund  
indirectly bears a pro rata share of the fees and expenses of the funds in  
 which it invests (also referred to as "acquired funds"), including affiliated
and non-affiliated pooled investment vehicles (including mutual funds and   
  exchange traded funds). Because the acquired funds have varied expense and fee
levels and the Fund may own different proportions of acquired funds at      
different times, the amount of fees and expenses incurred indirectly by the 
Fund will vary.

fees were reduced by $9,470 as a result of earnings and bank fee credits from   
overnight cash balances. The Fund pays custodian fees to Ameriprise Trust       
Company, a subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial.

obligations) aggregated $232,431,465 and $373,822,229, respectively, for the

5. AFFILIATED MONEY MARKET FUND                                                 

The Fund may invest its daily cash balance in RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund, 
a money market fund established for the exclusive use of the RiverSource funds  
and other institutional clients of RiverSource Investments. The cost of the     
Fund's purchases and proceeds from sales of shares of the RiverSource Short-Term
Cash Fund aggregated $650,675,285 and $608,257,217, respectively, for the year  
ended July 31, 2008. The income distributions received with respect to the      
Fund's investment in RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund can be found on the       
Statement of Operations and the Fund's invested balance in RiverSource Short-   
Term Cash Fund at July 31, 2008, can be found in the Portfolio of Investments.  

6. BANK BORROWINGS                                                              

The Fund has entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
headed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMCB), whereby the Fund may borrow for the
temporary funding of shareholder redemptions or for other temporary or emergency
purposes. The credit facility became effective on Oct. 18, 2007, replacing a    
prior credit facility. The credit facility agreement, which is a collective     
agreement between the Fund and certain other RiverSource funds, severally and   
not jointly, permits collective borrowings up to $500 million. Interest is      
charged to each Fund based on its borrowings at a rate equal to the federal     
funds rate plus 0.30%. Each borrowing under the credit facility matures no later
than 60 days after the date of borrowing. The Fund also pays a commitment fee   
equal to its pro rata share of the amount of the credit facility at a rate of   
0.06% per annum. Under the prior credit facility, a Fund paid interest on its   
outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to either the higher of the federal funds
effective rate plus 0.40% or the JPMCB Prime Commercial Lending Rate. The Fund  
had no borrowings during the year ended July 31, 2008.                          

7. CAPITAL LOSS CARRY-OVER AND POST-OCTOBER LOSS                                

For federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry-over of      
$3,522,163 at July 31, 2008, that if not offset by capital gains will expire as 
follows:                                                                        

                                                                [Download Table]

  2015        2016   
                     
$33,562    $3,488,601

Because the measurement periods for regulated investment company's income are   
different for excise tax purposes versus income tax purposes, special rules are 
in place to protect the amount of earnings and profits needed to support excise 
tax distributions. As a result, the Fund is permitted to treat net capital      
losses realized between Nov. 1, 2008 and its fiscal year end ("post-October     
loss") as occurring on the first day of the following tax year. At July 31,
2008, the Fund had a

P-->N-CSR53rd Page of 245TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 53rd
post-October loss of $13,804,258 that is treated for income tax purposes as     
occurring on Aug. 1, 2008.                                                      

It is unlikely the Board will authorize a distribution of any net realized      
capital gains until the available capital loss carry-over has been offset or    
expires.                                                                        

8. RISKS RELATING TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS                                        
FLOATING RATE LOAN RISK                                                         
The Fund invests primarily in floating rate loans, the market value of which may
fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. The principal risks of investing
in the Fund include liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk,            
counterparty risk, highly leveraged transactions risk, derivatives risk,        
confidential information access risk, and impairment of collateral risk.        
Generally, when interest rates rise, the prices of fixed income securities fall,
however, securities or loans with floating interest rates can be less sensitive 
to interest rate changes, but they may decline in value if their interest rates 
do not rise as much as interest rates in general. Limited liquidity may affect  
the ability of the Fund to purchase or sell floating rate loans and may have a  
negative impact on fund performance. The floating rate loans and securities in  
which the fund invests generally are lower rated (non-investment grade) and are 
more likely to experience a default, which results in more volatile prices and  
more risk to principal and income than investment grade loans or securities.    

9. INFORMATION REGARDING PENDING AND SETTLED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                  

In June 2004, an action captioned John E. Gallus et al. v. American Express     
Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors Inc., was filed in the  
United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs allege 
that they are investors in several American Express Company mutual funds and    
they purport to bring the action derivatively on behalf of those funds under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The plaintiffs allege that fees allegedly paid  
to the defendants by the funds for investment advisory and administrative       
services are excessive. The plaintiffs seek remedies including restitution and  
rescission of investment advisory and distribution agreements. The plaintiffs   
voluntarily agreed to transfer this case to the United States District Court for
the District of Minnesota. In response to defendants' motion to dismiss the     
complaint, the Court dismissed one of plaintiffs' four claims and granted       
plaintiffs limited discovery. Defendants moved for summary judgment in April    
2007. Summary judgment was granted in the defendants' favor on July 9, 2007. The
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on 
August 8, 2007.                                                                 

In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American Express
Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise

Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial)), entered into settlement agreements with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of        
Commerce (MDOC) related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was      
censured and ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any         
violations of certain provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the    
Investment Company Act of 1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay  
disgorgement of $10 million and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also  
agreed to retain an independent distribution consultant to assist in developing 
a plan for distribution of all disgorgement and civil penalties ordered by the  
SEC in accordance with various undertakings detailed at                         
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise Financial and its   
affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC in these legal proceedings,
and have made regular reports to the RiverSource Funds' Boards of               
Directors/Trustees.                                                             

Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically been       
involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, including
routine litigation, class actions, and governmental actions, concerning matters 
arising in connection with the conduct of their business activities. Ameriprise 
Financial believes that the Funds are not currently the subject of, and that    
neither Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are the subject of, any  
pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings that are likely to have a  
material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or  
its affiliates to perform under their contracts with the Funds. Ameriprise      
Financial is required to make 10-Q, 10-K and, as necessary, 8-K filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on legal and regulatory matters that relate  
to Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates. Copies of these filings may be      
obtained by accessing the SEC website at www.sec.gov.                           

There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity          
associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced    
sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the Funds. Further,        
although we believe proceedings are not likely to have a material adverse effect
on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform
under their contracts with the Funds, these proceedings are subject to          
uncertainties and, as such, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range
of loss that may result. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings 
could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other relief
that could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial         
condition or results of operations of Ameriprise Financial.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF                                   
RIVERSOURCE FLOATING RATE FUND:                                                 

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including 
the portfolio of investments, of RiverSource Floating Rate Fund (the Fund) (one 
of the portfolios constituting the RiverSource Bond Series, Inc.) as of July 31,
2008, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the      
statements of changes in net assets and the financial highlights for each of the
two years in the period then ended. These financial statements and financial    
highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our responsibility  
is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights 
based on our audits. The financial highlights of the Fund for the periods       
presented through July 31, 2006, were audited by other auditors whose report    
dated September 20, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial   
highlights.                                                                     

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company  
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were  
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial   
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial 
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the          
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.          
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used   
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall        
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of       
securities owned as of July 31, 2008, by correspondence with the custodian and  
brokers, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers 
were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights audited by us 
as referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial    
position of RiverSource Floating Rate Fund of the RiverSource Bond Series, Inc. 
at July 31, 2008, the results of its operations for the year then ended, and    
changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for each of the two years
in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles.

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES                                      
AGREEMENT ----------------------------------------------------------------------

RiverSource Investments, LLC ("RiverSource Investments" or the "investment      
manager"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise 
Financial"), serves as the investment manager to the Fund. Under an investment  
management services agreement (the "IMS Agreement") RiverSource Investments     
provides investment advice and other services to the Fund and all RiverSource   
funds (collectively, the "Funds").                                              

On an annual basis, the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board"), including the  
independent Board members (the "Independent Directors"), considers renewal of   
the IMS Agreement. RiverSource Investments prepared detailed reports for the    
Board and its Contracts Committee in March and April 2008, including reports    
based on data provided by independent organizations to assist the Board in      
making this determination. In addition, throughout the year, the Board (or its  
committees) reviews information prepared by RiverSource Investments addressing  
the services RiverSource Investments provides and Fund performance. The Board   
accords particular weight to the work, deliberations and conclusions of the     
Contracts, Investment Review and Compliance Committees in determining whether to
continue the IMS Agreement. At the April 9-10, 2008 in-person Board meeting,    
independent legal counsel to the Independent Directors reviewed with the        
Independent Directors various factors relevant to the Board's consideration of  
advisory agreements and the Board's legal responsibilities related to such      
consideration. Following an analysis and discussion of the factors identified   
below, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, approved renewal  
of the IMS Agreement.                                                           

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided by RiverSource Investments:  The
Board analyzed various reports and presentations it had received detailing the  
services performed by RiverSource Investments, as well as its expertise,        
resources and capabilities. The Board specifically considered many developments 
during the past year concerning the services provided by RiverSource            
Investments, including, in particular, the continued investment in, and         
resources dedicated to, the Fund's operations, particularly in the areas of     
trading systems, new product initiatives, legal and compliance. Further, in     
connection with the Board's evaluation of the overall package of services       
provided by RiverSource Investments, the Board considered the quality of the    
administrative and transfer agency services provided by RiverSource Investments'
affiliates to the Fund. The Board also reviewed the financial condition of      
RiverSource Investments (and its affiliates) and each entity's ability to carry 
out its responsibilities under the IMS Agreement. The Board also discussed the  
acceptability of the terms of the IMS Agreement (including the relatively broad 
scope of services required to be performed by RiverSource Investments). The     
Board concluded that the services

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES                                      
AGREEMENT (continued) ----------------------------------------------------------

being performed under the IMS Agreement were of a reasonably high quality,      
particularly in light of recent market conditions.                              

Based on the foregoing, and based on other information received (both oral and  
written, including the information on investment performance referenced below)  
and other considerations, the Board concluded that RiverSource Investments and  
its affiliates were in a position to continue to provide a high quality and     
level of services to the Fund.                                                  

Investment Performance:  For purposes of evaluating the nature, extent and      
quality of services provided under the IMS Agreement, the Board carefully       
reviewed the investment performance of the Fund. In this regard, the Board      
considered: (i) detailed reports containing data prepared by an independent     
organization showing, for various periods, the performance of the Fund, the     
performance of a benchmark index, the percentage ranking of the Fund among its  
comparison group and the net assets of the Fund; and (ii) a report detailing the
Fund's performance over various periods (including since inception), recent Fund
inflows (and outflows) and a comparison of the Fund's net assets from December  
2006 to December 2007. The Board observed that the Fund's investment performance
was appropriate in light of the particular management style and market          
conditions involved.                                                            

Comparative Fees, Costs of Services Provided and the Profits Realized By        
RiverSource Investments and its Affiliates from their Relationships with the    
Fund:  The Board reviewed comparative fees and the costs of services to be      
provided under the IMS Agreement. The Board members considered detailed         
comparative information set forth in an annual report on fees and expenses,     
including, among other things, data (prepared by an independent organization)   
showing a comparison of the Fund's expenses with median expenses paid by funds  
in its peer group, as well as data showing the Fund's contribution to           
RiverSource Investments' profitability.                                         

The Board accorded particular weight to the notion that the level of fees should
reflect a rational pricing model applied consistently across the various product
lines in the Funds' family, while assuring that the overall fees for each fund  
are generally in line with the "pricing philosophy" (i.e., that the total       
expense ratio of each fund, with few exceptions, is at or below the median      
expense ratio of funds in the same comparison group). The Board observed that   
the Fund's expense ratio (after considering proposed expense caps/waivers)      
approximated the peer group's median expense ratio. Based on its review, the    
Board concluded that

P-->N-CSR71st Page of 245TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 71st
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the Fund's management fee was fair and reasonable in light of the extent and    
quality of services that the Fund receives.                                     

The Board also considered the expected profitability of RiverSource Investments 
and its affiliates in connection with RiverSource Investments providing         
investment management services to the Fund. In this regard, the Board referred  
to a detailed profitability report, discussing the profitability to RiverSource 
Investments and Ameriprise Financial from managing and operating the Fund,      
including data showing comparative profitability over the past two years. The   
Board also considered the services acquired by the investment manager through   
the use of commission dollars paid by the Funds on portfolio transactions. The  
Board noted that the fees paid by the Fund should permit the investment manager 
to offer competitive compensation to its personnel, make necessary investments  
in its business and earn an appropriate profit. The Board concluded that        
profitability levels were reasonable.                                           

Economies of Scale to be Realized:  The Board also considered the economies of  
scale that might be realized by RiverSource Investments as the Fund grows and   
took note of the extent to which Fund shareholders might also benefit from such 
growth. The Board considered that the IMS Agreement provides for lower fees as  
assets increase at pre-established breakpoints and concluded that the IMS       
Agreement satisfactorily provided for sharing these economies of scale.         

Based on the foregoing, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors,  
concluded that the investment management service fees were fair and reasonable  
in light of the extent and quality of services provided. In reaching this       
conclusion, no single factor was determinative. On April 10, 2008, the Board,   
including all of the Independent Directors, approved the renewal of the IMS     
Agreement.                                                                      

PROXY VOTING -------------------------------------------------------------------

The policy of the Board is to vote all proxies of the companies in which the    
Fund holds investments consistent with the procedures as stated in the Statement
of Additional Information (SAI). You may obtain a copy of the SAI without charge

that year, and is available without charge by visiting riversource.com/funds; or

(See "The Fund's Long-term Performance" for Index descriptions)                 

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a      
guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of your  
investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more 
or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher    
than the performance information shown. You may obtain performance information  
current to the most recent month-end by contacting your financial institution or
visiting riversource.com/funds.                                                 

The 4.75% sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund is not reflected
in the table above. If reflected, returns would be lower than those shown. The  
performance of other classes may vary from that shown because of differences in 
expenses. See the Average Annual Total Returns table for performance of other   
share classes of the Fund.                                                      

The indices do not reflect the effects of sales charges, expenses (excluding    
Lipper) and taxes.                                                              

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

The style matrix can be a valuable tool for constructing and monitoring your    
portfolio. It provides a frame of reference for distinguishing the types of     
stocks or bonds owned by a mutual fund, and may serve as a guideline for helping
you build a portfolio.                                                          

Investment products, including shares of mutual funds, are not federally or     
FDIC-insured, are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed by any financial
institution, and involve investment risks including possible loss of principal

(a)  The Investment Manager and its affiliates                                  
have contractually agreed to waive certain fees and to absorb certain 
     expenses until July 31, 2009, unless sooner terminated at the discretion of
  the Fund's Board. Any amounts waived will not be reimbursed by the Fund.
 Under this agreement, net fund expenses (excluding fees and expenses of
acquired funds) will not exceed 1.01% for Class R4.                   

(1)  WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE measures a bond's maturity, which takes into         
    consideration the possibility that the issuer may call the bond before its
maturity date.                                                        
(2)  EFFECTIVE DURATION measures the sensitivity of a security's price to       
   parallel shifts in the yield curve (the graphical depiction of the levels
    of interest rates from two years out to 30 years). Positive duration means
   that as rates rise, the price decreases, and negative duration means that
as rates rise, the price increases.                                   
(3)  WEIGHTED AVERAGE BOND RATING represents the average credit quality of the  
underlying bonds in the portfolio.                                    

There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including credit  
risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment and extension risk. See the Fund's     
prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund. In
general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect  
is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities. Non-investment grade     
securities, commonly called "high-yield" or "junk" bonds, generally have more   
volatile prices and carry more risk to principal and income than investment     
grade securities.

4 RIVERSOURCE INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FUND -- 2008 ANNUAL REPORT                 

P-->N-CSR78th Page of 245TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 78th
MANAGER COMMENTARY -------------------------------------------------------------

At July 31, 2008, approximately 29% of the Fund's shares were owned in the      
aggregate by affiliated funds-of-funds managed by RiverSource Investments, LLC  
(RiverSource). As a result of asset allocation decisions by RiverSource, it is  
possible RiverSource Income Opportunities Fund may experience relatively large  
purchases or redemptions from affiliated funds-of-funds (see page 35, Class I   
capital share transactions for related activity during the most recent fiscal   
period). RiverSource seeks to minimize the impact of these transactions by

RiverSource Income Opportunities Fund (the Fund) Class A shares gained 1.30%    
(excluding sales charge) for the 12 months ended July 31, 2008. The Fund        
performed in line with its benchmark, the unmanaged Merrill Lynch U.S. High     
Yield Cash Pay BB-B Rated Constrained Index (Merrill Lynch Index), which        
advanced 1.37%. The Fund outperformed its peer group, as represented by the     
Lipper High Current Yield Bond Funds Index, which fell 1.19% during the same    
period.

Ratings apply to the underlying holdings of the Fund and not the Fund itself.   
Whenever possible, the Standard and Poor's rating is used to determine the      
credit quality of a security. Standard and Poor's rates the creditworthiness of 
loans and bonds, using 15 categories, ranging from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). 
Ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus   
(-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. If       
Standard and Poor's doesn't rate a security, then Moody's rating is used.       
RiverSource Investments, LLC, the Fund's investment manager, rates a security   
using an internal rating system when Moody's doesn't provide a rating.

SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE FACTORS                                                 
The Fund benefited most from its significant allocations to and security        
selection within the energy and health care industries, which generally         
performed well. Energy benefited from soaring oil and gas prices; health care   
proved to be a defensive sector in a challenging market. Oil and gas exploration
and production company SANDRIDGE ENERGY and oilfield services provider DRESSER  
were particularly strong performers in the energy industry. Related to the      
energy industry, utilities company WILLIAMS COS., which specializes in natural  
gas pipelines, also performed well. In health care, OMNICARE, which primarily   
provides pharmaceuticals and related pharmacy services to long-term care        
institutions, was an outstanding individual performer. Elsewhere, wireline      
company WINDSTREAM performed well, as regional local exchange carriers proved to
be a rather defensive industry. CARDTRONICS, an ATM provider, was another strong
performer, advancing primarily on increased market share earned through several 
new contract wins, including that of the 7-ELEVEN store chain. ASURION, a cell  
phone insurance provider, also contributed positively to Fund performance. We   
sold the Fund's position in ASURION toward the end of the annual period, taking 
a profit. The Fund's results were also helped during the period by having only  
modest exposure to the autos, auto parts and suppliers, and auto finance areas  
and to publishing, as each of these industries lagged during the period.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We strive to select the right bonds while maintaining a diligent review of      
potential credit risks at individual companies.                                 

Conversely, having only modest exposure to the                                  
software services and metals and mining industries,                             
which each outpaced the Merrill Lynch Index,                                    
detracted from the Fund's results. A more sizable                               
allocation to the broadcasting/media industry, which                            
performed poorly due to a decline in advertising                                
spending during the period, further detracted.                                  
Several individual positions also hurt the Fund's                               
performance. A position in auto loan company TRIAD                              
ACQUISITION hurt, as this holding was driven down by                            
widespread troubles in the consumer finance market.                             
ALION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, whose main client is                              
the U.S. Defense Department, also detracted from the                            
Fund's performance, as it missed some analysts'                                 
expectations with its revenue results and was                                   
downgraded during the period. Mexican glass maker                               
VITRO was weak for no fundamental reason of its own,                            
but rather got swept by the broad brushstrokes of a                             
correction in the emerging market debt market.                                  
Wireless company SPRINT NEXTEL also performed poorly                            
during the period, although a recent change in its                              
management provides reason for optimism for its                                 
prospects ahead. Indeed, based on our ongoing credit                            
research, we maintained the Fund's positions in each                            
of these weak performers, as we continued to like                               
their fundamentals and were constructive on their                               
prospects going forward.                                                        

The Fund outpaced its Lipper peer group due                                     
primarily to effective security selection and                                   
industry allocation during the annual period. Also                              
helping in part was the fact that the Fund does not                             
buy bonds rated CCC by both rating agencies. Bonds                              
rated CCC, the riskiest area of the high yield bond                             
market, underperformed bonds rated BB and B during                              
the annual period.

MANAGER COMMENTARY (continued) -------------------------------------------------

CHANGES TO THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO                                                 
Over the course of the period, as investors grew increasingly risk averse amidst
a liquidity crunch, recession concerns and the aftermath of turmoil in the      
housing, subprime mortgage and credit markets, we shifted to an increasingly    
defensive stance within the Fund's portfolio. We upgraded the quality of the    
holdings overall, such that the Fund began the period with a yield in excess of 
the Merrill Lynch Index and ended the period with a yield lower than that of the
Merrill Lynch Index. We increased the Fund's exposure to more defensive         
industries, such as energy exploration and production, defense and regional     
local exchange carriers. We correspondingly reduced the Fund's weighting to more
cyclical, economically sensitive areas, including autos, auto parts and supply  
and auto finance, as well as paper. Also, the Fund's exposure to financials     
relative to the Merrill Lynch Index decreased, as the financials universe of    
securities grew, but we did not increase the Fund's position in this area.      

At the end of the annual period, the Fund had sizable allocations compared to   
the Merrill Lynch Index in energy, gaming, health care, defense, food and       
beverage, and, to a lesser extent, broadcasting/media and services. The Fund had
more modest exposure than the Merrill Lynch Index to the metals and mining;     
autos and auto parts, supply and finance; retail; financials; publishing;       
technology; and paper and forest products industries at the end of July 2008.   
The Fund had virtually equal weighting to the Merrill Lynch Index in the        
integrated telecommunications and utilities sectors.                            

OUR FUTURE STRATEGY                                                             
Going forward, we continue to believe that the key to potential outperformance  
will be leveraging our strength in credit research. We strive to select the     
right bonds while maintaining a diligent review of potential credit risks at    
individual companies. We sell bonds when we believe that risks outweigh a bond's
total return potential.                                                         

We have a bottom-up approach when selecting credits. One of our competitive     
advantages is that our team of nine analysts performs in-depth research to      
acquire deep knowledge and insight of the industries they cover. We believe that
good security selection based on quality and in-depth security research will be 
key to performance over the near to mid term.

8 RIVERSOURCE INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FUND -- 2008 ANNUAL REPORT                 

P-->N-CSR82nd Page of 245TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 82nd
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On the macroeconomic front, we remain cautious in our view for the high yield   
bond market given ongoing uncertainty regarding the extent of an economic       
slowdown and of the credit market's troubles. As oil and gas prices soared      
during the 12 months to new record levels, inflationary pressures also became a 
growing concern, especially as it may impact profit margins going forward.      
Further, we anticipate that the default rate within the high yield bond market  
may increase somewhat in the months ahead, and we remain guarded about company  
fundamentals. Valuations at the end of the annual period did not fully reflect, 
in our view, these broad concerns for the high yield bond market. All told,     
given that we believe the high yield bond market may continue to face meaningful
headwinds during the second half of 2008, taking incremental risk when          
valuations do not justify it does not seem prudent. Thus, we currently intend to
maintain the Fund's emphasis on more defensive industries with less exposure to 
cyclical, economically sensitive sectors. We further intend, of course, to      
continue to seek opportunities to capitalize on attractively valued bonds that  
have the potential for positive returns.

THE FUND'S LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE -----------------------------------------------
The chart on the facing page illustrates the total value of an assumed $10,000  
investment in RiverSource Income Opportunities Fund Class A shares (from 7/01/03
to 7/31/08)* as compared to the performance of two widely cited performance     
indices, the Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Cash Pay BB-B Rated Constrained Index
and the Lipper High Current Yield Bond Funds Index. In comparing the Fund's     
Class A shares to these indices, you should take into account the fact that the 
Fund's performance reflects the maximum sales charge of 4.75%, while such       
charges are not reflected in the performance of the indices. Returns for the    
Fund include the reinvestment of any distribution paid during each period.      

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a      
guarantee of future results. The table below and the chart on the facing page do
not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund         
distributions or the redemption of fund shares. The investment return and       
principal value of your investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when     
redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current           
performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. You  
may obtain performance information current to the most recent month-end by      
contacting your financial institution or visiting riversource.com/funds. Also

FUND EXPENSES EXAMPLE ----------------------------------------------------------
(UNAUDITED)                                                                     

As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction     
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase payments; and (2) ongoing    
costs, which may include management fees; distribution and service (12b-1) fees;
and other Fund fees and expenses. This example is intended to help you          
understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to      
compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.  
In addition to the ongoing expenses which the Fund bears directly, the Fund's   
shareholders indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which it invests (also
referred to as "acquired funds"), including affiliated and non-affiliated pooled
investment vehicles (including mutual funds and exchange traded funds). The     
Fund's indirect expense from investing in the acquired funds is based on the    
Fund's pro rata portion of the cumulative expenses charged by the acquired funds
using the expense ratio of each of the acquired funds as of the acquired fund's 
most recent shareholder report.                                                 

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the six months ended July 31, 2008.                         

ACTUAL EXPENSES                                                                 

The first line of the table provides information about actual account values and
actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together with the    
amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period.    
Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value
divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first   
line under the heading titled "Expenses paid during the period" to estimate the 
expenses you paid on your account during this period.                           

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES                                    

The second line of the table provides information about hypothetical account    
values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and an
assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Fund's  
actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to  
estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. 
You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the   
Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5%
hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your    
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales    
charges (loads). Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing 
ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of 
owning different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included,
your costs would have been higher.

(e)  Pay-in-kind securities are securities in which the issuer makes interest or

usually have the same terms as the original holdings.                 

(f)  Mortgage-backed securities represent direct or indirect participations in, 
or are secured by and payable from, mortgage loans secured by real    
   property, and include single- and multi-class pass-through securities and

    guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities, or by private
   issuers, generally originators and investors in mortgage loans, including
savings associations, mortgage bankers, commercial banks, investment  
  bankers and special purpose entities. The maturity dates shown represent
 the original maturity of the underlying obligation. Actual maturity may

(i)  For those zero coupon bonds that become coupon paying at a future date, the
    interest rate disclosed represents the annualized effective yield from the
date of acquisition to maturity.

(l)  Represents a senior loan purchased on a when-issued or delayed-delivery    
     basis. Certain details associated with this purchase are not known prior to
     the settlement date of the transaction. In addition, senior loans typically
     trade without accrued interest and therefore a weighted average coupon rate
    is not available prior to settlement. At settlement, if still unknown, the
borrower or counterparty will provide the Fund with the final weighted
average coupon rate and maturity date.                                

(m)  Affiliated Money Market Fund - See Note 5 to the financial statements. The 
rate shown is the seven-day current annualized yield at July 31, 2008.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --------------------------------------------------

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                   

RiverSource Income Opportunities Fund (the Fund) is a series of RiverSource Bond
Series, Inc. and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (as     
amended) as a diversified, open-end management investment company. RiverSource  
Bond Series, Inc. has 10 billion authorized shares of capital stock that can be 
allocated among the separate series as designated by the Board of Directors (the
Board). The Fund invests primarily in income-producing debt securities, with an 
emphasis on the higher rated segment of the high-yield (junk bond) market.      

The Fund offers Class A, Class B, Class C, Class I and Class R4 shares.         

-  Class A shares are sold with a front-end sales charge.                       

-  Class B shares may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC)   
and automatically convert to Class A shares during the ninth year of      
ownership.                                                                

-  Class C shares may be subject to a CDSC.                                     

-  Class I and Class R4 shares are sold without a front-end sales charge or CDSC
and are offered to qualifying institutional investors.                    

At July 31, 2008, RiverSource Investments, LLC (RiverSource Investments or the  
Investment Manager) and the RiverSource affiliated funds-of-funds owned 100% of 
Class I shares.                                                                 

At July 31, 2008, the Investment Manager and the RiverSource affiliated         
funds-of-funds owned approximately 29% of the total outstanding Fund shares.    

All classes of shares have identical voting, dividend and liquidation rights.   
Class specific expenses (e.g., distribution and service fees, transfer agency   
fees, plan administration services fees) differ among classes. Income, expenses 
(other than class specific expenses) and realized and unrealized gains or losses
on investments are allocated to each class of shares based upon its relative net
assets.                                                                         

The Fund's significant accounting policies are summarized below:                

USE OF ESTIMATES                                                                

Preparing financial statements that conform to U.S. generally accepted          
accounting principles requires management to make estimates (e.g., on assets,   
liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities) that could differ from actual
results.                                                                        

VALUATION OF SECURITIES 

All securities are valued at the close of each business day. Securities traded  
on national securities exchanges or included in national market systems are     
valued at the last quoted sales price. Debt securities are generally traded in  
the over-the-counter market and are valued at a price that reflects fair value  
as quoted by

dealers in these securities or by an independent pricing service. Foreign       
securities are valued based on quotations from the principal market in which    
such securities are normally traded. The procedures adopted by the Board        
generally contemplate the use of fair valuation in the event that price         
quotations or valuations are not readily available, price quotations or         
valuations from other sources are not reflective of market value and thus deemed
unreliable, or a significant event has occurred in relation to a security or    
class of securities (such as foreign securities) that is not reflected in price 
quotations or valuations from other sources. A fair value price is a good faith 
estimate of the value of a security at a given point in time.                   

Many securities markets and exchanges outside the U.S. close prior to the close 
of the New York Stock Exchange and therefore the closing prices for securities  
in such markets or on such exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur    
after such close but before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, including 
significant movements in the U.S. market after foreign exchanges have closed.   
Accordingly, in those situations, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise        
Financial), parent company of the Investment Manager, as administrator to the   
Fund, will fair value foreign securities pursuant to procedures adopted by the  
Board, including utilizing a third party pricing service to determine these fair
values. These procedures take into account multiple factors, including movements
in the U.S. securities markets, to determine a good faith estimate that         
reasonably reflects the current market conditions as of the close of the New    
York Stock Exchange. Swap transactions are valued through an authorized pricing 
service, broker, or an internal model.                                          

Short-term securities maturing in more than 60 days from the valuation date are 
valued at the market price or approximate market value based on current interest
rates; those maturing in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.          

ILLIQUID SECURITIES                                                             

At July 31, 2008, investments in securities included issues that are illiquid   
which the Fund currently limits to 15% of net assets, at market value, at the   
time of purchase. The aggregate value of such securities at July 31, 2008 was   
$1,531,261 representing 0.65% of net assets. These securities may be valued at  
fair value according to procedures approved, in good faith, by the Board.       
According to Board guidelines, certain unregistered securities are determined to
be liquid and are not included within the 15% limitation specified above. Assets
are liquid if they can be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business
within seven days at approximately the value at which the asset is valued by the
Fund.                                                                           

SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A FORWARD-COMMITMENT BASIS AND UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS

Delivery and payment for securities that have been purchased by the Fund on a   
forward-commitment basis, including when-issued securities and other forward-   
commitments, can take place one month or more after the transaction date. During

this period, such securities are subject to market fluctuations, and they may   
affect the Fund's net assets the same as owned securities. The Fund designates  
cash or liquid securities at least equal to the amount of its                   
forward-commitments. At July 31, 2008, the Fund has outstanding when-issued     
securities of $303,120.                                                         

The Fund may enter into certain credit agreements, all or a portion of which may
be unfunded. The Fund is obligated to fund these loan commitments at the        
borrower's discretion. These commitments are disclosed in the Portfolio of      
Investments. At July 31, 2008, the Fund has entered into unfunded loan          
commitments of $303,120.                                                        

The Fund also enters into transactions to sell purchase commitments to third    
parties at current market values and concurrently acquires other purchase       
commitments for similar securities at later dates. As an inducement for the Fund
to "roll over" its purchase commitments, the Fund receives negotiated amounts in
the form of reductions of the purchase price of the commitment. The Fund records
the incremental difference between the forward purchase and sale of each forward
roll as realized gain or loss. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of  
the securities or if a counterparty does not perform under the terms of the     
agreement. If a counterparty files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the     
Fund's right to repurchase or sell securities may be limited. The Fund did not  
enter into any mortgage dollar roll transactions during the year ended July 31,
2008.                                                                           

OPTION TRANSACTIONS                                                             

To produce incremental earnings, protect gains, and facilitate buying and       
selling of securities for investments, the Fund may buy and write options traded
on any U.S. or foreign exchange or in the over-the-counter market where         
completing the obligation depends upon the credit standing of the other party.  
Cash collateral may be collected by the Fund to secure certain over-the-counter 
options trades. Cash collateral held by the Fund for such option trades must be 
returned to the counterparty upon closure, exercise or expiration of the        
contract. The Fund also may buy and sell put and call options and write covered 
call options on portfolio securities as well as write cash-secured put options. 
The risk in writing a call option is that the Fund gives up the opportunity for 
profit if the market price of the security increases. The risk in writing a put 
option is that the Fund may incur a loss if the market price of the security    
decreases and the option is exercised. The risk in buying an option is that the 
Fund pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised. The Fund also has   
the additional risk of being unable to enter into a closing transaction if a    
liquid secondary market does not exist.                                         

Option contracts are valued daily at the closing prices on their primary        
exchanges and unrealized appreciation or depreciation is recorded. The Fund will
realize a gain or loss when the option transaction expires or closes. When      
options on debt securities or futures are exercised, the Fund will realize a    
gain or loss. When other options are exercised, the proceeds on sales for a     
written call option, the purchase

cost for a written put option or the cost of a security for a purchased put or  
call option is adjusted by the amount of premium received or paid. At July 31,
2008, and for the year then ended, the Fund had no outstanding option contracts.

FUTURES TRANSACTIONS                                                            

To gain exposure to or protect itself from market changes, the Fund may buy and 
sell financial futures contracts traded on any U.S. or foreign exchange. The    
Fund also may buy and write put and call options on these futures contracts.    
Risks of entering into futures contracts and related options include the        
possibility of an illiquid market and that a change in the value of the contract
or option may not correlate with changes in the value of the underlying         
securities.                                                                     

Futures are valued daily based upon the last sale price at the close of market  
on the principal exchange on which they are traded. Upon entering into a futures
contract, the Fund is required to deposit either cash or securities in an amount
(initial margin) equal to a certain percentage of the contract value. Subsequent
payments (variation margin) are made or received by the Fund each day. The      
variation margin payments are equal to the daily changes in the contract value  
and are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. The Fund recognizes a realized 
gain or loss when the contract is closed or expires. At July 31, 2008, the Fund 
had no outstanding futures contracts.                                           

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS AND FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS 

Securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies   
are translated daily into U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts related to the 
purchase or sale of securities and income and expenses are translated at the    
exchange rate on the transaction date. The effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates on realized and unrealized security gains or losses is reflected as a     
component of such gains or losses. In the Statement of Operations, net realized 
gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, if any, may arise from sales
of foreign currency, closed forward contracts, exchange gains or losses realized
between the trade date and settlement date on securities transactions, and other
translation gains or losses on dividends, interest income and foreign           
withholding taxes.                                                              

The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for operational      
purposes and to protect against adverse exchange rate fluctuation. The net U.S. 
dollar value of foreign currency underlying all contractual commitments held by 
the Fund and the resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation are          
determined using foreign currency exchange rates from an independent pricing    
service. The Fund is subject to the credit risk that the other party will not   
complete its contract obligations. At July 31, 2008, the Fund had no outstanding
forward foreign currency contracts.                                             

CMBS TOTAL RETURN SWAP TRANSACTIONS                                             

The Fund may enter into swap agreements to earn the total return on a specified 
security or index of fixed income securities. CMBS total return swaps are       
bilateral

P-->N-CSR102nd Page of 245TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 102nd
financial contracts designed to replicate synthetically the total returns of    
commercial mortgage-backed securities. Under the terms of the swaps, the Fund   
either receives or pays the total return on a reference security or index       
applied to a notional principal amount. In return, the Fund agrees to pay or    
receive from the counterparty a floating rate, which is reset periodically based
on short-term interest rates, applied to the same notional amount.              

The notional amounts of swap contracts are not recorded in the financial        
statements. Swaps are valued daily, and the change in value is recorded as      
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the termination of the swap, at    
which time realized gain (loss) is recorded. Payments received or made are      
recorded as realized gains (losses).                                            

Swap agreements may be subject to liquidity risk, which exists when a particular
swap is difficult to purchase or sell. It may not be possible for the Fund to   
initiate a transaction or liquidate a position at an advantageous time or price,
which may result in significant losses. Total return swaps are subject to the   
risk that the counterparty will default on its obligation to pay net amounts due
to the Fund. At July 31, 2008, the Fund had no outstanding CMBS total return    
swap contracts.                                                                 

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP TRANSACTIONS                                                

The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts to increase or decrease   
its credit exposure to an issuer, obligation, portfolio, or index of issuers or 
obligations, to hedge its exposure on an obligation that it owns or in lieu of  
selling such obligations. As the purchaser of a credit default swap contract,   
the Fund purchases protection by paying a periodic interest rate on the notional
amount to the counterparty. The interest amount is accrued daily as a component 
of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and is recorded as a realized loss    
upon payment. If the credit event specified in the contract occurs, the Fund    
will be required to deliver either the referenced obligation or an equivalent   
cash amount to the protection seller and in exchange the Fund will receive the  
notional amount from the seller. The difference between the value of the        
obligation delivered and the notional amount received will be recorded as a     
realized gain (loss). As the seller of a credit default swap contract, the Fund 
sells protection to a buyer and will generally receive a periodic interest rate 
on the notional amount. The interest amount is accrued daily as a component of  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and is recorded as a realized gain upon  
receipt of the payment. If the credit event specified in the contract occurs,   
the Fund will receive the referenced obligation or an equivalent cash amount in 
exchange for the payment of the notional amount to the protection buyer. The    
difference between the value of the obligation received and the notional amount 
paid will be recorded as a realized gain (loss). As a protection seller, the    
maximum amount of the payment made by the Fund may equal the notional amount, at
par, of the underlying index or security as a result of the related credit      
event.

P-->N-CSR103rd Page of 245TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 103rd
The notional amounts of credit default swap contracts are not recorded in the   
financial statements. Any premium paid or received by the Fund upon entering    
into a credit default swap contract is recorded as an asset or liability and    
amortized daily as a component of realized gain (loss) on the Statement of      
Operations. At July 31, 2008, there were no credit default swap contracts       
outstanding which had a premium paid or received by the Fund. Credit default    
swap contracts are valued daily, and the change in value is recorded as         
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the termination of the swap, at    
which time a realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                  

Credit default swap contracts can involve greater risks than if a fund had      
invested in the reference obligation directly since, in addition to general     
market risks, credit default swaps are subject to counterparty credit risk,     
leverage risk, hedging risk, correlation risk and liquidity risk. The Fund will 
enter into credit default swap agreements only with counterparties that meet    
certain standards of creditworthiness. At July 31, 2008, the Fund had no        
outstanding credit default swap contracts.                                      

GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS                                                 

Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are       
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their 
duties to the Fund. In addition, certain of the Fund's contracts with its       
service providers contain general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum   
exposure under these arrangements is unknown since the amount of any future     
claims that may be made against the Fund cannot be determined and the Fund has  
no historical basis for predicting the likelihood of any such claims.           

FEDERAL TAXES                                                                   

The Fund's policy is to comply with Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code   
that applies to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially  
all of its taxable income to shareholders. No provision for income or excise    
taxes is thus required.                                                         

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation 48 (FIN 48),         
"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," clarifies the accounting for      
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB Statement 109,   
"Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 prescribes a two-step process to recognize
and measure a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The   
first step is to determine whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than- 
not recognition threshold and the second step is to measure a tax position that 
meets the threshold to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. Management 
of the Fund has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions 
that would require recognition in the financial statements. Generally, the tax  
authorities can examine all the tax returns filed for the last three years.     

Net investment income (loss) and net realized gains (losses) may differ for     
financial statement and tax purposes primarily because of recognition of

unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for certain derivative investments, post-
October losses and losses deferred due to wash sales. The character of          
distributions made during the year from net investment income or net realized   
gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for federal income tax    
purposes. Also, due to the timing of dividend distributions, the fiscal year in 
which amounts are distributed may differ from the year that the income or       
realized gains (losses) were recorded by the Fund.                              

On the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, as a result of permanent book-to-tax
differences, undistributed net investment income has been decreased by          
$1,078,284 and accumulated net realized loss has been decreased by $1,078,284.  

The tax character of distributions paid for the years indicated is as follows:

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS                                                

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  
161 (SFAS 161), "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging

Activities - an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," which requires enhanced   
disclosures about a fund's derivative and hedging activities. Funds are required
to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why a fund uses derivative    
instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are        
accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how       
derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a fund's financial       
position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for      
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
Nov. 15, 2008. As of July 31, 2008, management does not believe the adoption of 
SFAS 161 will impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional       
footnote disclosures may be required about the use of derivative instruments and
hedging items.                                                                  

On Sept. 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes an           
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a hierarchy for measuring fair 
value, and requires additional disclosures about the inputs used to develop the 
measurements of fair value and the effect of certain measurements reported in   
the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period. The application of SFAS 157    
will be effective for the Fund's fiscal year beginning Aug. 1, 2008. The        
adoption of SFAS 157 is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Fund's 
financial statements; however, additional disclosures will be required about the
inputs used to develop the measurements of fair value and the effect of certain 
measurements reported in the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period.       

DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                       

Dividends from net investment income, declared daily and payable monthly, when  
available, are reinvested in additional shares of the Fund at net asset value or
payable in cash. Capital gains, when available, are distributed along with the  
last income dividend of the calendar year.                                      

OTHER                                                                           

Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities are purchased or 
sold. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-dividend date or upon receipt of  
ex-dividend notification in the case of certain foreign securities. Interest    
income, including amortization of premium, market discount and original issue   
discount using the effective interest method, is accrued daily.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FEES                                             

Under an Investment Management Services Agreement, the Investment Manager       
determines which securities will be purchased, held or sold. The management fee 
is a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets that declines from 0.61% 
to

0.38% annually as the Fund's assets increase. The management fee for the year   
ended July 31, 2008 was 0.61% of the Fund's average daily net assets.           

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FEES                                                    

Under an Administrative Services Agreement, the Fund pays Ameriprise Financial a
fee for administration and accounting services at a percentage of the Fund's    
average daily net assets that declines from 0.07% to 0.04% annually as the      
Fund's assets increase. The fee for the year ended July 31, 2008 was 0.07% of   
the Fund's average daily net assets.                                            

OTHER FEES                                                                      

Other expenses are for, among other things, certain expenses of the Fund or the 
Board including: Fund boardroom and office expense, employee compensation,      
employee health and retirement benefits, and certain other expenses. Payment of 
these Fund and Board expenses is facilitated by a company providing limited     
administrative services to the Fund and the Board. For the year ended July 31,
2008, other expenses paid to this company were $1,176.                          

COMPENSATION OF BOARD MEMBERS                                                   

Compensation of board members includes, for a former Board Chair, compensation  
as well as retirement benefits. Certain other aspects of a former Board Chair's 
compensation, including health benefits and payment of certain other expenses,  
are included under other expenses.                                              

Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), non-interested board members may 
defer receipt of their compensation. Deferred amounts are treated as though     
equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the Fund or other      
RiverSource funds. The Fund's liability for these amounts is adjusted for market
value changes and remains in the Fund until distributed in accordance with the  
Plan.                                                                           

TRANSFER AGENCY FEES                                                            

Under a Transfer Agency Agreement, RiverSource Service Corporation (the Transfer
Agent) maintains shareholder accounts and records. The Fund pays the Transfer   
Agent an annual account-based fee at a rate equal to $20.50 for Class A, $21.50 
for Class B and $21.00 for Class C for this service. The Fund also pays the     
Transfer Agent an annual asset-based fee at a rate of 0.05% of the Fund's       
average daily net assets attributable to Class R4 shares.                       

The Transfer Agent charges an annual fee of $5 per inactive account, charged on 
a pro rata basis for 12 months from the date the account becomes inactive. These
fees are included in the transfer agency fees on the Statement of Operations.   

PLAN ADMINISTRATION SERVICES FEES

The Fund has an agreement with RiverSource Distributors, Inc. (the Distributor) 
for distribution and shareholder services. Prior to Oct. 1, 2007, Ameriprise    
Financial Services, Inc. also served as a principal underwriter and distributor 
to the Fund. Under a Plan and Agreement of Distribution pursuant to Rule 12b-1, 
the Fund pays a fee at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the Fund's average daily
net assets attributable to Class A shares and a fee at an annual rate of up to  
1.00% of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class B and Class C
shares. For Class B and Class C shares, up to 0.75% of the fee is reimbursed for
distribution expenses.                                                          

The amount of distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor and not yet     
reimbursed ("unreimbursed expense") was approximately $907,000 and $33,000 for  
Class B and Class C shares, respectively. These amounts are based on the most   
recent information available as of July 31, 2008, and may be recovered from     
future payments under the distribution plan or CDSC. To the extent the          
unreimbursed expense has been fully recovered, the distribution fee is reduced. 

SALES CHARGES                                                                   

Sales charges received by the Distributor for distributing Fund shares were     
$107,471 for Class A, $28,027 for Class B and $157 for Class C for the year     
ended July 31, 2008.

discretion of the Board, such that net expenses (excluding fees and expenses of 
acquired funds*), will not exceed the following percentage of the Fund's average
daily net assets:                                                               

                                                                [Download Table]
                                                                         
Class R4....................................................        1.01%

*    In addition to the fees and expenses which the Fund bears directly, the    
Fund indirectly bears a pro rata share of the fees and expenses of the
     funds in which it invests (also referred to as "acquired funds"), including
    affiliated and non-affiliated pooled investment vehicles (including mutual
  funds and exchange traded funds). Because the acquired funds have varied
expense and fee levels and the Fund may own different proportions of  
     acquired funds at different times, the amount of fees and expenses incurred
indirectly by the Fund will vary.                                     

EARNINGS AND BANK FEE CREDITS                                                   

During the year ended July 31, 2008, the Fund's custodian and transfer agency   
fees were reduced by $5,836 as a result of earnings and bank fee credits from   
overnight cash balances. The Fund pays custodian fees to Ameriprise Trust       
Company, a subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial.                                  

3. SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS                                                      

Cost of purchases and proceeds from sales of securities (other than short-term  
obligations) aggregated $205,616,784 and $274,548,882, respectively, for the    
year ended July 31, 2008. Realized gains and losses are determined on an        
identified cost basis.

5. AFFILIATED MONEY MARKET FUND                                                 

The Fund may invest its daily cash balance in RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund, 
a money market fund established for the exclusive use of the RiverSource funds  
and other institutional clients of RiverSource Investments. The cost of the     
Fund's purchases and proceeds from sales of shares of the RiverSource Short-Term
Cash Fund aggregated $136,916,752 and $133,614,135, respectively, for the year  
ended July 31, 2008. The income distributions received with respect to the      
Fund's investment in RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund can be found on the       
Statement of Operations and the Fund's invested balance in RiverSource          
Short-Term Cash Fund at July 31, 2008, can be found in the Portfolio of         
Investments.                                                                    

6. BANK BORROWINGS                                                              

The Fund has entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
headed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMCB), whereby the Fund may borrow for the
temporary funding of shareholder redemptions or for other temporary or emergency
purposes. The credit facility became effective on Oct. 18, 2007, replacing a    
prior credit facility. The credit facility agreement, which is a collective     
agreement between the Fund and certain other RiverSource funds, severally and   
not jointly, permits collective borrowings up to $500 million. Interest is      
charged to each Fund based on its borrowings at a rate equal to the federal     
funds rate plus 0.30%. Each borrowing under the credit facility matures no later
than 60 days after the date of borrowing. The Fund also pays a commitment fee   
equal to its pro rata share of the amount of the credit facility at a rate of   
0.06% per annum. Under the prior credit facility, a Fund paid interest on its   
outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to either the higher of the federal funds
effective rate plus 0.40% or the JPMCB Prime Commercial Lending Rate. The Fund  
had no borrowings during the year ended July 31, 2008.                          

7. CAPITAL LOSS CARRY-OVER AND POST-OCTOBER LOSS                                

For federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry-over of      
$1,946,556 at July 31, 2008, that if not offset by capital gains will expire in 
2016.

Because the measurement periods for a regulated investment company's income are 
different for excise tax purposes versus income tax purposes, special rules are 
in place to protect the amount of earnings and profits needed to support excise 
tax distributions. As a result, the Fund is permitted to treat net capital      
losses realized between Nov. 1, 2007 and its fiscal year end ("post-October     
loss") as occurring on the first day of the following tax year. At July 31,
2008, the Fund had a post-October loss of $10,486,987 that is treated for income
tax purposes as occurring on Aug. 1, 2008.                                      

It is unlikely the Board will authorize a distribution of any net realized      
capital gains until the available capital loss carry-over has been offset or    
expires.                                                                        

8. INFORMATION REGARDING PENDING AND SETTLED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                  

In June 2004, an action captioned John E. Gallus et al. v. American Express     
Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors Inc., was filed in the  
United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs allege 
that they are investors in several American Express Company mutual funds and    
they purport to bring the action derivatively on behalf of those funds under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The plaintiffs allege that fees allegedly paid  
to the defendants by the funds for investment advisory and administrative       
services are excessive. The plaintiffs seek remedies including restitution and  
rescission of investment advisory and distribution agreements. The plaintiffs   
voluntarily agreed to transfer this case to the United States District Court for
the District of Minnesota. In response to defendants' motion to dismiss the     
complaint, the Court dismissed one of plaintiffs' four claims and granted       
plaintiffs limited discovery. Defendants moved for summary judgment in April    
2007. Summary judgment was granted in the defendants' favor on July 9, 2007. The
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on 
August 8, 2007.                                                                 

In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American Express
Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise Financial, Inc.   
(Ameriprise Financial)), entered into settlement agreements with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDOC)       
related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was censured and ordered 
to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain        
provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of
1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay disgorgement of $10 million
and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also agreed to retain an          
independent distribution consultant to assist in developing a plan for          
distribution of all disgorgement and civil penalties ordered by the SEC in      
accordance with various undertakings detailed at                                
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise Financial and its   
affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC in these legal proceedings,

and have made regular reports to the RiverSource Funds' Boards of Directors/    
Trustees.                                                                       

Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically been       
involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, including
routine litigation, class actions, and governmental actions, concerning matters 
arising in connection with the conduct of their business activities. Ameriprise 
Financial believes that the Funds are not currently the subject of, and that    
neither Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are the subject of, any  
pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings that are likely to have a  
material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or  
its affiliates to perform under their contracts with the Funds. Ameriprise      
Financial is required to make 10-Q, 10-K and, as necessary, 8-K filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on legal and regulatory matters that relate  
to Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates. Copies of these filings may be      
obtained by accessing the SEC website at www.sec.gov.                           

There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity          
associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced    
sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the Funds. Further,        
although we believe proceedings are not likely to have a material adverse effect
on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform
under their contracts with the Funds, these proceedings are subject to          
uncertainties and, as such, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range
of loss that may result. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings 
could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other relief
that could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial         
condition or results of operations of Ameriprise Financial.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF                                   
RIVERSOURCE INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FUND:                                          

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including 
the portfolio of investments, of RiverSource Income Opportunities Fund (the     
Fund) (one of the portfolios constituting the RiverSource Bond Series, Inc.) as 
of July 31, 2008, and the related statement of operations for the year then     
ended, the statements of changes in net assets, and the financial highlights for
each of the two years in the period then ended. These financial statements and  
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our       
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and       
financial highlights based on our audits. The financial highlights of the Fund  
for the periods presented through July 31, 2006, were audited by other auditors 
whose report dated September 20, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial highlights.                                                           

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company  
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were  
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial   
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial 
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the          
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.          
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used   
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall        
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of       
securities owned as of July 31, 2008, by correspondence with the custodian and  
brokers, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers 
were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights audited by us 
as referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial    
position of RiverSource Income Opportunities Fund of the RiverSource Bond       
Series, Inc. at July 31, 2008, the results of its operations for the year then  
ended, and changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for each of   
the two years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally       
accepted accounting principles.

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES                                      
AGREEMENT ----------------------------------------------------------------------

RiverSource Investments, LLC ("RiverSource Investments" or the "investment      
manager"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise 
Financial"), serves as the investment manager to the Fund. Under an investment  
management services agreement (the "IMS Agreement") RiverSource Investments     
provides investment advice and other services to the Fund and all RiverSource   
funds (collectively, the "Funds").                                              

On an annual basis, the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board"), including the  
independent Board members (the "Independent Directors"), considers renewal of   
the IMS Agreement. RiverSource Investments prepared detailed reports for the    
Board and its Contracts Committee in March and April 2008, including reports    
based on data provided by independent organizations to assist the Board in      
making this determination. In addition, throughout the year, the Board (or its  
committees) reviews information prepared by RiverSource Investments addressing  
the services RiverSource Investments provides and Fund performance. The Board   
accords particular weight to the work, deliberations and conclusions of the     
Contracts, Investment Review and Compliance Committees in determining whether to
continue the IMS Agreement. At the April 9-10, 2008 in-person Board meeting,    
independent legal counsel to the Independent Directors reviewed with the        
Independent Directors various factors relevant to the Board's consideration of  
advisory agreements and the Board's legal responsibilities related to such      
consideration. Following an analysis and discussion of the factors identified   
below, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, approved renewal  
of the IMS Agreement.                                                           

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided by RiverSource Investments: The 
Board analyzed various reports and presentations it had received detailing the  
services performed by RiverSource Investments, as well as its expertise,        
resources and capabilities. The Board specifically considered many developments 
during the past year concerning the services provided by RiverSource            
Investments, including, in particular, the continued investment in, and         
resources dedicated to, the Fund's operations, particularly in the areas of     
trading systems, new product initiatives, legal and compliance. Further, in     
connection with the Board's evaluation of the overall package of services       
provided by RiverSource Investments, the Board considered the quality of the    
administrative and transfer agency services provided by RiverSource Investments'
affiliates to the Fund. The Board also reviewed the financial condition of      
RiverSource Investments (and its affiliates) and each entity's ability to carry 
out its responsibilities under the IMS Agreement. The Board also discussed the  
acceptability of the terms of the IMS Agreement (including the relatively broad 
scope of services required to be performed by RiverSource Investments). The     
Board concluded that the services being performed under the

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES                                      
AGREEMENT (continued) ----------------------------------------------------------

IMS Agreement were of a reasonably high quality, particularly in light of recent
market conditions.                                                              

Based on the foregoing, and based on other information received (both oral and  
written, including the information on investment performance referenced below)  
and other considerations, the Board concluded that RiverSource Investments and  
its affiliates were in a position to continue to provide a high quality and     
level of services to the Fund.                                                  

Investment Performance:  For purposes of evaluating the nature, extent and      
quality of services provided under the IMS Agreement, the Board carefully       
reviewed the investment performance of the Fund. In this regard, the Board      
considered: (i) detailed reports containing data prepared by an independent     
organization showing, for various periods, the performance of the Fund, the     
performance of a benchmark index, the percentage ranking of the Fund among its  
comparison group and the net assets of the Fund; and (ii) a report detailing the
Fund's performance over various periods (including since inception), recent Fund
inflows (and outflows) and a comparison of the Fund's net assets from December  
2006 to December 2007. The Board observed that the Fund's investment performance
met expectations.                                                               

Comparative Fees, Costs of Services Provided and the Profits Realized By        
RiverSource Investments and its Affiliates from their Relationships with the    
Fund: The Board reviewed comparative fees and the costs of services to be       
provided under the IMS Agreement. The Board members considered detailed         
comparative information set forth in an annual report on fees and expenses,     
including, among other things, data (prepared by an independent organization)   
showing a comparison of the Fund's expenses with median expenses paid by funds  
in its peer group, as well as data showing the Fund's contribution to           
RiverSource Investments' profitability.                                         

The Board accorded particular weight to the notion that the level of fees should
reflect a rational pricing model applied consistently across the various product
lines in the Funds' family, while assuring that the overall fees for each fund  
are generally in line with the "pricing philosophy" (i.e., that the total       
expense ratio of each fund, with few exceptions, is at or below the median      
expense ratio of funds in the same comparison group). The Board took into       
account that the Fund's total expense ratio (after considering proposed expense 
caps/waivers) was slightly below the peer group's median expense ratio shown in 
the reports. Based on its review, the Board concluded that the Fund's management
fee was fair and reasonable in light of the extent and quality of services that 
the Fund receives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Board also considered the expected profitability of RiverSource Investments 
and its affiliates in connection with RiverSource Investments providing         
investment management services to the Fund. In this regard, the Board referred  
to a detailed profitability report, discussing the profitability to RiverSource 
Investments and Ameriprise Financial from managing and operating the Fund,      
including data showing comparative profitability over the past two years. The   
Board also considered the services acquired by the investment manager through   
the use of commission dollars paid by the Funds on portfolio transactions. The  
Board noted that the fees paid by the Fund should permit the investment manager 
to offer competitive compensation to its personnel, make necessary investments  
in its business and earn an appropriate profit. The Board concluded that        
profitability levels were reasonable.                                           

Economies of Scale to be Realized:  The Board also considered the economies of  
scale that might be realized by RiverSource Investments as the Fund grows and   
took note of the extent to which Fund shareholders might also benefit from such 
growth. The Board considered that the IMS Agreement provides for lower fees as  
assets increase at pre-established breakpoints and concluded that the IMS       
Agreement satisfactorily provided for sharing these economies of scale.         

Based on the foregoing, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors,  
concluded that the investment management service fees were fair and reasonable  
in light of the extent and quality of services provided. In reaching this       
conclusion, no single factor was determinative. On April 10, 2008, the Board,   
including all of the Independent Directors, approved the renewal of the IMS     
Agreement.

(a) Fund data is from March 4, 2004. Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury Inflation    
Notes Index is from March 1, 2004.                                      

(See "The Fund's Long-term Performance" for Index descriptions)                 

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a      
guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of your  
investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more 
or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher    
than the performance information shown. You may obtain performance information  
current to the most recent month-end by contacting your financial institution or
visiting riversource.com/funds.                                                 

The 3.00% sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund, which changed  
from 4.75% effective March 3, 2008, is not reflected in the table above. If     
reflected, returns would be lower than those shown. The performance of other    
classes may vary from that shown because of differences in expenses. See the    
Average Annual Total Returns table for performance of other share classes of the
Fund.                                                                           

The index does not reflect the effects of sales charges, expenses and taxes.    

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

(a) The Investment Manager and its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive
certain fees and to absorb certain expenses until July 31, 2009, unless 
   sooner terminated at the discretion of the Fund's Board. Any amounts waived
   will not be reimbursed by the Fund. Under this agreement, net fund expenses
 (excluding fees and expenses of acquired funds) will not exceed 0.85% for
   Class A, 1.61% for Class B, 1.60% for Class C, 0.51% for Class I, 0.73% for
Class R4 and 0.96% for Class W.                                         

(1) WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE measures a bond's maturity, which takes into          
  consideration the possibility that the issuer may call the bond before its
maturity date.                                                          
(2) EFFECTIVE DURATION measures the sensitivity of a security's price to        
    parallel shifts in the yield curve (the graphical depiction of the levels of
    interest rates from two years out to 30 years). Positive duration means that
as rates rise, the price decreases, and negative duration means that as 
rates rise, the price increases.                                        
(3) WEIGHTED AVERAGE BOND RATING represents the average credit quality of the   
underlying bonds in the portfolio.                                      

There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including credit  
risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment and extension risk. See the Fund's     
prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund. In
general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect  
is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.

MANAGER COMMENTARY -------------------------------------------------------------

At July 31, 2008, approximately 43% of the Fund's shares were owned in the      
aggregate by affiliated funds-of-funds managed by RiverSource Investments, LLC  
(RiverSource). As a result of asset allocation decisions by RiverSource, it is  
possible RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund may experience         
relatively large purchases or redemptions from affiliated funds-of-funds (see   
page 28, Class I capital share transactions for related activity during the most
recent fiscal period). RiverSource seeks to minimize the impact of these        
transactions by structuring them over a reasonable period of time. RiverSource  
Inflation Protected Securities Fund may experience increased expenses as it buys
and sells securities as a result of purchases or redemptions by affiliated      
funds-of-funds. For more information on the Fund's expenses, see the discussions
beginning on pages 12 and 24.                                                   

Dear Shareholder,                                                               

RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund (the Fund) Class A shares gained
11.24% (excluding sales charge) for the 12 months ended July 31, 2008. The Fund 
underperformed its benchmark, the unmanaged Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury       
Inflation Notes Index (Lehman Index), which advanced 11.95% for the same period.

SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE FACTORS                                                 
The Fund benefited from its significant exposure to Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities (TIPS), whose interest payments are automatically adjusted to help   
offset inflation, as yields of TIPS moved lower during the period. Bond yields  
and prices typically move in opposite directions. Yields on TIPS were driven    
lower by the Federal Reserve Board's (the Fed's) dramatic easing amidst a       
slowing U.S. economy and heightened financial market turmoil. The TIPS market   
also rallied during the period as investors grew increasingly risk averse and   
sought to benefit from heightened inflationary pressures. Indeed, as the year   
progressed, demand for TIPS grew, as the Fed sounded the inflation alarm yet,   
rather than addressing inflation, acted instead to address slowing economic     
growth

and ease the credit crisis by cutting interest rates. Overall U.S. inflation    
that accrued to the Fund during the annual period came in at an annualized rate 
of 4.2%.                                                                        

When reviewing the performance of TIPS, it is critical to distinguish between   
overall inflation and core inflation. Overall inflation takes into consideration
food and energy as a component of the cost of living. It is the overall         
inflation rate to which the principal and interest on TIPS are tied. Actual     
inflation came in at an annualized rate of 5.6% for the 12 months, the highest  
annual inflation rate in 17 years, as energy prices rose at exceptionally fast  
rates -- especially during the fourth quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 
2008. For example, crude oil prices rose more than 29% during the first seven   
months of 2008 alone. Retail gasoline increased from a U.S. national average of 
$3.04 per gallon to $3.91 per gallon over the same time frame. Food prices      
increased materially as well. In fact, overall inflation rose significantly     
above expectations, and that inflation got passed through the assets in the     
Fund. In contrast, core inflation, a measure closely monitored by the Fed,      
excludes food and energy. Core inflation came in modestly higher than what was  
generally expected at 2.5% for the annual period; the Fed's "comfort zone" for  
core inflation is between 1.5% and 2% a year.                                   

The Fund also benefited during the period from its yield curve positioning,     
wherein holdings were concentrated at the shorter- to intermediate-term end of  
the TIPS yield curve. As the TIPS yield curve steepened during the 12 months    
overall, meaning yields fell more at the

Bond ratings apply to the underlying holdings of the Fund and not the Fund      
itself. Whenever possible, the Standard and Poor's rating is used to determine  
the credit quality of a security. Standard and Poor's rates the creditworthiness
of corporate bonds, with 15 categories, ranging from AAA (highest) to D         
(lowest). Ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+)  
or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. 
If Standard and Poor's doesn't rate a security, then Moody's rating is used.    
RiverSource Investments, LLC, the Fund's investment manager, rates a security   
using an internal rating system when Moody's doesn't provide a rating.

shorter end of the yield curve than at the longer end, shorter-term securities  
outperformed longer-dated securities for the annual period.                     

Further boosting the Fund's results modestly during the period was establishing 
a position in what are known as French linkers, or inflation-linked government  
bonds, hedged back to the U.S. dollar. A position in nominal U.S. government    
agency bonds also added to performance during the time held in the Fund's       
portfolio.                                                                      

Detracting from the Fund's annual results was its duration positioning. The Fund
maintained a defensive duration position (a measure of the Fund's sensitivity to
interest rates) that was shorter than the Lehman Index. We had the Fund         
positioned for higher rates, but, as mentioned, yields declined during the      
period. Our economic view had not included the extent of economic weakness nor  
of financial market turmoil, the two primary factors leading to the Fed's seven 
interest rate cuts during the period. That said, active management of duration  
positioning as market conditions shifted did help reduce the impact of the      
Fund's overall defensive stance.                                                

CHANGES TO THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO                                                 
As mentioned above, we adjusted the Fund's duration positioning as market       
conditions shifted throughout, but still left it shorter than the Lehman Index. 
Also, we established a position in French inflation-linked government bonds     
during the period.                                                              

We added long-dated nominal U.S. government agency senior debenture bonds to the
Fund when spreads, or the difference in yields between these bonds and nominal  
Treasuries, widened during the                                                  

In our view, overall inflation will stay elevated during the second half of 
2008, as inflationary pressures, including pass-through effects from high   
energy and food prices, feed through to core prices over the months ahead.

third calendar quarter. We then took profits from these agency securities when  
spreads subsequently tightened early in the fourth quarter of 2007.             

During the second half of the fiscal year, we established a position in U.S.    
agency subordinated debt. Subordinated debt is debt that ranks below other      
securities with regard to claims on assets or earnings, but, which typically    
offers a higher rate of return than senior debt due to the increased inherent   
risk. Subordinated debt of U.S. agencies is widely considered to be             
comparatively less risky than that of banks or other issuers. The Fund's        
position in U.S. agency subordinated debt detracted from the Fund's performance 
in July, but we continued to hold the position based on our view ahead.         

OUR FUTURE STRATEGY                                                             
In our view, overall inflation will stay elevated during the second half of     
2008, as inflationary pressures, including pass-through effects from high energy
and food prices, feed through to core prices over the months ahead. Indeed,     
positive economic growth expected over the remainder of this year, combined with
lingering high inflation expectations, mean inflation will likely remain high   
well into 2009. While recent Fed commentary regarding inflation has begun to    
sound more hawkish, the financial markets appear to have little conviction that 
the Fed will actually address inflation with interest rate hikes anytime soon.  
We believe core inflation is likely to increase slightly over the near term, as 
non-energy and food prices are forced higher, which in turn will push inflation 
expectations higher as well. We believe that it will be this threat of more     
widespread inflation that may force the Fed to reverse direction and start      
raising short-term interest rates some time late in 2008 or early 2009. The     
speed at which the Fed moves to raise short-term interest rates could determine 
the path of inflation. From the Fund's perspective, what may be most important  
is that we believe that overall inflation will remain materially above core     
inflation.

Given this view, we intend to maintain the Fund's current short duration        
positioning, or interest rate risk, for the near term. We also intend to        
maintain the Fund's emphasis on TIPS over nominal Treasuries. We will, of       
course, continue to closely monitor inflation figures, real rates, security     
prices, economic data and Fed policy shifts and adjust the portfolio's holdings 
and duration stance if necessary.

THE FUND'S LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE -----------------------------------------------

The chart on the facing page illustrates the total value of an assumed $10,000  
investment in RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund Class A shares    
(from 3/1/04 to 7/31/08)* as compared to the performance of a widely cited      
performance index, the Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury Inflation Notes Index. In  
comparing the Fund's Class A shares to this index, you should take into account 
the fact that the Fund's performance reflects a maximum sales charge of 4.75%,  
which changed to 3.00% effective March 3, 2008. Such charges are not reflected  
in the performance of the index. Returns for the Fund include the reinvestment  
of any distribution paid during each period.                                    

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a      
guarantee of future results. The table below and the chart on the facing page do
not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund         
distributions or the redemption of fund shares. The investment return and       
principal value of your investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when     
redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current           
performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. You  
may obtain performance information current to the most recent month-end by

(1) On March 3, 2008, the maximum sales charge for Class A changed from 4.75% to
    3.00%. Class A share performance reflects the maximum sales charge of 4.75%,
which was in effect at the beginning of all periods.                    

(2) The Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury Inflation Notes Index, an unmanaged index,
   measures the performance of the inflation protected obligations of the U.S.
  Treasury. The index reflects reinvestment of all distributions and changes
in market prices.                                                       

(3) Fund data is from March 4, 2004. Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury Inflation

FUND EXPENSES EXAMPLE ----------------------------------------------------------
(UNAUDITED)                                                                     
As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction     
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase payments; and (2) ongoing    
costs, which may include management fees; distribution and service (12b-1) fees;
and other Fund fees and expenses. This example is intended to help you          
understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to      
compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.  
In addition to the ongoing expenses which the Fund bears directly, the Fund's   
shareholders indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which it invests (also
referred to as "acquired funds"), including affiliated and non-affiliated pooled
investment vehicles (including mutual funds and exchange traded funds). The     
Fund's indirect expense from investing in the acquired funds is based on the    
Fund's pro rata portion of the cumulative expenses charged by the acquired funds
using the expense ratio of each of the acquired funds as of the acquired fund's 
most recent shareholder report.                                                 

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the six months ended July 31, 2008.                         

ACTUAL EXPENSES                                                                 
The first line of the table provides information about actual account values and
actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together with the    
amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period.    
Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value
divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first   
line under the heading titled "Expenses paid during the period" to estimate the 
expenses you paid on your account during this period.                           

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES                                    
The second line of the table provides information about hypothetical account    
values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and an
assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Fund's  
actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to  
estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. 
You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the   
Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5%
hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your    
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales    
charges (loads). Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing 
ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of 
owning different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included,
your costs would have been higher.

(a) Expenses are equal to the Fund's annualized expense ratio as indicated      
  above, multiplied by the average account value over the period, multiplied
by 182/366 (to reflect the one-half year period).                       
(b) Based on the actual return for the six months ended July 31, 2008: +0.04%   
for Class A, -0.43% for Class B, -0.44% for Class C, +0.22% for Class I,
+0.20% for Class R4 and -0.01% for Class W.                             
(c) The Investment Manager and its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive
certain fees and to absorb certain expenses until July 31, 2009, unless 
sooner terminated at the discretion of the Fund's Board, such that net  
 expenses (excluding fees and expenses of acquired funds), will not exceed
   0.85% for Class A, 1.61% for Class B, 1.60% for Class C, 0.51% for Class I,
0.73% for Class R4 and 0.96% for Class W. Any amounts waived will not be
reimbursed by the Fund. This change was effective Aug. 1, 2008. Had this
 change been in place for the entire six month period ended July 31, 2008,
   the actual expenses paid would have been $4.23 for Class A, $7.99 for Class
B, $7.94 for Class C, $2.54 for Class I and $4.77 for Class W; the      
hypothetical expenses paid would have been $4.27 for Class A, $8.07 for 
Class B, $8.02 for Class C, $2.56 for Class I and $4.82 for Class W. The
   actual and hypothetical expenses paid for Class R4 would have been the same
as those expenses presented in the table above.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --------------------------------------------------

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                   

RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund (the Fund) is a series of       
RiverSource Bond Series, Inc. and is registered under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 (as amended) as a non-diversified, open-end management investment       
company. RiverSource Bond Series, Inc. has 10 billion authorized shares of      
capital stock that can be allocated among the separate series as designated by  
the Board of Directors (the Board). The Fund invests primarily in inflation-    
protected debt securities. These securities include inflation-indexed bonds of  
varying maturities issued by the U.S. and non-U.S. governments, their agencies  
or instrumentalities, and corporations.                                         

The Fund offers Class A, Class B, Class C, Class I, Class R4 and Class W shares.

-  Class A shares are sold with a front-end sales charge.                       

-  Class B shares may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC)   
and automatically convert to Class A shares during the ninth year of      
ownership. Effective March 3, 2008, Class B shares were closed to new     
investors and new purchases.                                              

-  Class C shares may be subject to a CDSC.                                     

-  Class I and Class R4 shares are sold without a front-end sales charge or CDSC
and are offered to qualifying institutional investors.                    

-  Class W shares are sold without a front-end sales charge or CDSC and are     
offered through qualifying discretionary accounts.                        

At July 31, 2008, RiverSource Investments, LLC (RiverSource Investments or the  
Investment Manager) and the RiverSource affiliated funds-of-funds owned 100% of 
Class I shares.                                                                 

At July 31, 2008, the Investment Manager and the RiverSource affiliated funds-  
of-funds owned approximately 43% of the total outstanding Fund shares.          

All classes of shares have identical voting, dividend and liquidation rights.   
Class specific expenses (e.g., distribution and service fees, transfer agency   
fees, plan administration services fees) differ among classes. Income, expenses 
(other than class specific expenses) and realized and unrealized gains or losses
on investments are allocated to each class of shares based upon its relative net
assets.                                                                         

The Fund's significant accounting policies are summarized below:                

USE OF ESTIMATES                                                                
Preparing financial statements that conform to U.S. generally accepted          
accounting principles requires management to make estimates (e.g., on assets,

liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities) that could differ from actual
results.                                                                        

VALUATION OF SECURITIES 
All securities are valued at the close of each business day. Securities traded  
on national securities exchanges or included in national market systems are     
valued at the last quoted sales price. Debt securities are generally traded in  
the over-the-counter market and are valued at a price that reflects fair value  
as quoted by dealers in these securities or by an independent pricing service.  
Foreign securities are valued based on quotations from the principal market in  
which such securities are normally traded. The procedures adopted by the Board  
generally contemplate the use of fair valuation in the event that price         
quotations or valuations are not readily available, price quotations or         
valuations from other sources are not reflective of market value and thus deemed
unreliable, or a significant event has occurred in relation to a security or    
class of securities (such as foreign securities) that is not reflected in price 
quotations or valuations from other sources. A fair value price is a good faith 
estimate of the value of a security at a given point in time.                   

Many securities markets and exchanges outside the U.S. close prior to the close 
of the New York Stock Exchange and therefore the closing prices for securities  
in such markets or on such exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur    
after such close but before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, including 
significant movements in the U.S. market after foreign exchanges have closed.   
Accordingly, in those situations, Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise        
Financial), parent company of the Investment Manager, as administrator to the   
Fund, will fair value foreign securities pursuant to procedures adopted by the  
Board, including utilizing a third party pricing service to determine these fair
values. These procedures take into account multiple factors, including movements
in the U.S. securities markets, to determine a good faith estimate that         
reasonably reflects the current market conditions as of the close of the New    
York Stock Exchange.                                                            

Short-term securities maturing in more than 60 days from the valuation date are 
valued at the market price or approximate market value based on current interest
rates; those maturing in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.          

OPTION TRANSACTIONS                                                             
To produce incremental earnings, protect gains, and facilitate buying and       
selling of securities for investments, the Fund may buy and write options traded
on any U.S. or foreign exchange or in the over-the-counter market where         
completing the obligation depends upon the credit standing of the other party.  
Cash collateral may be collected by the Fund to secure certain over-the-counter 
options trades. Cash collateral held by the Fund for such option trades must be 
returned to the counterparty upon closure, exercise or expiration of the        
contract. The Fund also may buy and sell put and call options and write covered 
call options on portfolio                                                       

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

P-->N-CSR149th Page of 245TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 149th
securities as well as write cash-secured put options. The risk in writing a call
option is that the Fund gives up the opportunity for profit if the market price 
of the security increases. The risk in writing a put option is that the Fund may
incur a loss if the market price of the security decreases and the option is    
exercised. The risk in buying an option is that the Fund pays a premium whether 
or not the option is exercised. The Fund also has the additional risk of being  
unable to enter into a closing transaction if a liquid secondary market does not
exist.                                                                          

Option contracts are valued daily at the closing prices on their primary        
exchanges and unrealized appreciation or depreciation is recorded. The Fund will
realize a gain or loss when the option transaction expires or closes. When      
options on debt securities or futures are exercised, the Fund will realize a    
gain or loss. When other options are exercised, the proceeds on sales for a     
written call option, the purchase cost for a written put option or the cost of a
security for a purchased put or call option is adjusted by the amount of premium
received or paid. At July 31, 2008, and for the year then ended, the Fund had no
outstanding option contracts.                                                   

FUTURES TRANSACTIONS                                                            
To gain exposure to or protect itself from market changes, the Fund may buy and 
sell financial futures contracts on any U.S. or foreign exchange. The Fund also 
may buy and write put and call options on these futures contracts. Risks of     
entering into futures contracts and related options include the possibility of  
an illiquid market and that a change in the value of the contract or option may 
not correlate with changes in the value of the underlying securities.           

Futures are valued daily based upon the last sale price at the close of market  
on the principal exchange on which they are traded. Upon entering into a futures
contract, the Fund is required to deposit either cash or securities in an amount
(initial margin) equal to a certain percentage of the contract value. Subsequent
payments (variation margin) are made or received by the Fund each day. The      
variation margin payments are equal to the daily changes in the contract value  
and are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. The Fund recognizes a realized 
gain or loss when the contract is closed or expires.                            

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS AND FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS 
Securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies   
are translated daily into U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts related to the 
purchase or sale of securities and income and expenses are translated at the    
exchange rate on the transaction date. The effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates on realized and unrealized security gains or losses is reflected as a     
component of such gains or losses. In the Statement of Operations, net realized 
gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, if any, may arise from sales
of foreign currency, closed forward contracts, exchange gains or losses realized
between the trade date and settlement date on securities transactions, and other

translation gains or losses on dividends, interest income and foreign           
withholding taxes.                                                              

The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for operational      
purposes and to protect against adverse exchange rate fluctuation. The net U.S. 
dollar value of foreign currency underlying all contractual commitments held by 
the Fund and the resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation are          
determined using foreign currency exchange rates from an independent pricing    
service. The Fund is subject to the credit risk that the other party will not   
complete its contract obligations. At July 31, 2008, the Fund had no outstanding
forward foreign currency contracts.                                             

GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS                                                 
Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are       
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their 
duties to the Fund. In addition, certain of the Fund's contracts with its       
service providers contain general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum   
exposure under these arrangements is unknown since the amount of any future     
claims that may be made against the Fund cannot be determined and the Fund has  
no historical basis for predicting the likelihood of any such claims.           

FEDERAL TAXES                                                                   
The Fund's policy is to comply with Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code   
that applies to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially  
all of its taxable income to shareholders. No provision for income or excise    
taxes is thus required.                                                         

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation 48 (FIN 48),         
"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," clarifies the accounting for      
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB Statement 109,   
"Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 prescribes a two-step process to recognize
and measure a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The   
first step is to determine whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than- 
not recognition threshold and the second step is to measure a tax position that 
meets the threshold to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. Management 
of the Fund has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions 
that would require recognition in the financial statements. Generally, the tax  
authorities can examine all the tax returns filed for the last three years.     

Net investment income (loss) and net realized gains (losses) may differ for     
financial statement and tax purposes primarily because of futures contracts,    
foreign currency transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. The        
character of distributions made during the year from net investment income or   
net realized gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for federal  
income tax purposes. Also, due to the timing of dividend distributions, the     
fiscal

or realized gains (losses) were recorded by the Fund.                           

On the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, as a result of permanent book-to-tax
differences, undistributed net investment income has been increased by $16,981  
and accumulated net realized gain has been decreased by $16,981.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS                                                
In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  
161 (SFAS 161), "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging           
Activities -- an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," which requires

       RIVERSOURCE INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES FUND -- 2008 ANNUAL REPORT  23

P-->N-CSR152nd Page of 245TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 152nd
enhanced disclosures about a fund's derivative and hedging activities. Funds are
required to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why a fund uses      
derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items 
are accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how   
derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a fund's financial       
position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for      
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
Nov. 15, 2008. As of July 31, 2008, management does not believe the adoption of 
SFAS 161 will impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional       
footnote disclosures may be required about the use of derivative instruments and
hedging items.                                                                  

On Sept. 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes an           
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a hierarchy for measuring fair 
value, and requires additional disclosures about the inputs used to develop the 
measurements of fair value and the effect of certain measurements reported in   
the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period. The application of SFAS 157    
will be effective for the Fund's fiscal year beginning Aug. 1, 2008. The        
adoption of SFAS 157 is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Fund's 
financial statements; however, additional disclosures will be required about the
inputs used to develop the measurements of fair value and the effect of certain 
measurements reported in the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period.       

DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                       
Dividends from net investment income, declared daily and payable monthly, when  
available, are reinvested in additional shares of the Fund at net asset value or
payable in cash. Capital gains, when available, are distributed along with the  
last income dividend of the calendar year.                                      

OTHER                                                                           
Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities are purchased or 
sold. Dividend income, if any is recognized on the ex-dividend date and interest
income, including amortization of premium, market discount and original issue   
discount using the effective interest method, is accrued daily. Inflation       
adjustments to the principal amount and cost basis of inflation-indexed         
securities are included in interest income.                                     

2. EXPENSES AND SALES CHARGES                                                   
INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FEES                                             
Under an Investment Management Services Agreement, the Investment Manager       
determines which securities will be purchased, held or sold. The management fee 
is a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets that declines from 0.44% 
to

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FEES                                                    
Under an Administrative Services Agreement, the Fund pays Ameriprise Financial a

average daily net assets that declines from 0.07% to 0.04% annually as the      
Fund's assets increase. The fee for the year ended July 31, 2008 was 0.07% of   
the Fund's average daily net assets.                                            

OTHER FEES                                                                      
Other expenses are for, among other things, certain expenses of the Fund or the 
Board including: Fund boardroom and office expense, employee compensation,      
employee health and retirement benefits, and certain other expenses. Payment of 
these Fund and Board expenses is facilitated by a company providing limited     
administrative services to the Fund and the Board. For the year ended July 31,
2008, other expenses paid to this company were $200.                            

COMPENSATION OF BOARD MEMBERS                                                   
Compensation of Board members includes, for a former Board Chair, compensation  
as well as retirement benefits. Certain other aspects of a former Board Chair's 
compensation, including health benefits and payment of certain other expenses,  
are included under other expenses.                                              

Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), non-interested board members may 
defer receipt of their compensation. Deferred amounts are treated as though     
equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the Fund or other      
RiverSource funds. The Fund's liability for these amounts is adjusted for market
value changes and remains in the Fund until distributed in accordance with the  
Plan.                                                                           

TRANSFER AGENCY FEES                                                            
Under a Transfer Agency Agreement, RiverSource Service Corporation (the Transfer
Agent) maintains shareholder accounts and records. The Fund pays the Transfer   
Agent an annual account-based fee at a rate equal to $20.50 for Class A, $21.50 
for Class B and $21.00 for Class C for this service. The Fund also pays the     
Transfer Agent an annual asset-based fee at a rate of 0.05% of the Fund's       
average daily net assets attributable to Class R4 shares and an annual asset-   
based fee at a rate of 0.20% of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable
to Class W shares.                                                              

The Transfer Agent charges an annual fee of $5 per inactive account, charged on 
a pro rata basis for 12 months from the date the account becomes inactive. These
fees are included in the transfer agency fees on the Statement of Operations.

PLAN ADMINISTRATION SERVICES FEES                                               
Under a Plan Administration Services Agreement with the Transfer Agent, the Fund
pays an annual fee at a rate of 0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets    
attributable to Class R4 shares for the provision of various administrative,    
recordkeeping, communication and educational services.                          

DISTRIBUTION FEES                                                               
The Fund has an agreement with RiverSource Distributors, Inc. (the Distributor) 
for distribution and shareholder services. Prior to Oct. 1, 2007, Ameriprise    
Financial Services, Inc. also served as a principal underwriter and distributor 
to the Fund. Under a Plan and Agreement of Distribution pursuant to Rule 12b-1, 
the Fund pays a fee at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the Fund's average daily
net assets attributable to Class A and Class W shares and a fee at an annual    
rate of up to 1.00% of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class
B and Class C shares. For Class B and Class C shares, up to 0.75% of the fee is 
reimbursed for distribution expenses.                                           

The amount of distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor and not yet     
reimbursed ("unreimbursed expense") was approximately $1,169,000 and $76,000 for
Class B and Class C shares, respectively. These amounts are based on the most   
recent information available as of July 31, 2008, and may be recovered from     
future payments under the distribution plan or CDSC. To the extent the          
unreimbursed expense has been fully recovered, the distribution fee is reduced. 

SALES CHARGES

* In addition to the fees and expenses which the Fund bears directly, the Fund  
indirectly bears a pro rata share of the fees and expenses of the funds in  
 which it invests (also referred to as "acquired funds"), including affiliated
and non-affiliated pooled investment vehicles (including mutual funds and   
  exchange traded funds). Because the acquired funds have varied expense and fee
levels and the Fund may own different proportions of acquired funds at      
different times, the amount of fees and expenses incurred indirectly by the 
Fund will vary.

6. BANK BORROWINGS                                                              

The Fund has entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
headed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMCB), whereby the Fund may borrow for the
temporary funding of shareholder redemptions or for other temporary or emergency
purposes. The credit facility became effective on Oct. 18, 2007, replacing a    
prior credit facility. The credit facility agreement, which is a collective     
agreement between the Fund and certain other RiverSource funds, severally and   
not jointly, permits collective borrowings up to $500 million. Interest is      
charged to each Fund based on its borrowings at a rate equal to the federal     
funds rate plus 0.30%. Each borrowing under the credit facility matures no later
than 60 days after the date of borrowing. The Fund also pays a commitment fee   
equal to its pro rata share of the amount of the credit facility at a rate of   
0.06% per annum. Under the prior credit facility, a Fund paid interest on its   
outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to either the higher of the federal funds
effective rate plus 0.40% or the JPMCB Prime Commercial Lending Rate. The Fund  
had no borrowings during the year ended July 31, 2008.                          

7. RISKS RELATING TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS                                        
DIVERSIFICATION RISK                                                            
The Fund is non-diversified. A non-diversified fund may invest more of its      
assets in fewer companies than if it were a diversified fund. The Fund may be   
more exposed to the risks of loss and volatility than a fund that invests more  
broadly.                                                                        

INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES RISK                                             
Inflation-protected debt securities tend to react to change in real interest    
rates. Real interest rates can be described as nominal interest rates minus the 
expected impact of inflation. In general, the price of an inflation-protected   
debt security falls when real interest rates rise, and rises when real interest 
rates fall. Interest payments on inflation-protected debt securities will vary  
as the principal and/or interest is adjusted for inflation and may be more      
volatile than interest paid on ordinary bonds. In periods of deflation, the Fund
may have no income at all. Income earned by a shareholder depends on the amount 
of principal invested and that principal will not grow with inflation unless the
investor reinvests the portion of Fund distributions that comes from inflation  
adjustments.                                                                    

8. INFORMATION REGARDING PENDING AND SETTLED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                  

In June 2004, an action captioned John E. Gallus et al. v. American Express     
Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors Inc., was filed in the

United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs allege 
that they are investors in several American Express Company mutual funds and    
they purport to bring the action derivatively on behalf of those funds under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The plaintiffs allege that fees allegedly paid  
to the defendants by the funds for investment advisory and administrative       
services are excessive. The plaintiffs seek remedies including restitution and  
rescission of investment advisory and distribution agreements. The plaintiffs   
voluntarily agreed to transfer this case to the United States District Court for
the District of Minnesota. In response to defendants' motion to dismiss the     
complaint, the Court dismissed one of plaintiffs' four claims and granted       
plaintiffs limited discovery. Defendants moved for summary judgment in April    
2007. Summary judgment was granted in the defendants' favor on July 9, 2007. The
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on 
August 8, 2007.                                                                 

In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American Express
Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise Financial, Inc.   
(Ameriprise Financial)), entered into settlement agreements with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDOC)       
related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was censured and ordered 
to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain        
provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of
1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay disgorgement of $10 million
and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also agreed to retain an          
independent distribution consultant to assist in developing a plan for          
distribution of all disgorgement and civil penalties ordered by the SEC in      
accordance with various undertakings detailed at                                
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise Financial and its   
affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC in these legal proceedings,
and have made regular reports to the RiverSource Funds' Boards of               
Directors/Trustees.                                                             

Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically been       
involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, including
routine litigation, class actions, and governmental actions, concerning matters 
arising in connection with the conduct of their business activities. Ameriprise 
Financial believes that the Funds are not currently the subject of, and that    
neither Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are the subject of, any  
pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings that are likely to have a  
material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or  
its affiliates to perform under their contracts with the Funds. Ameriprise      
Financial is required to make 10-Q, 10-K and, as necessary, 8-K filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on legal and regulatory matters that relate  
to Ameriprise Financial and its affiliates. Copies of these filings may be      
obtained by accessing the SEC website at www.sec.gov.

There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity          
associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced    
sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the Funds. Further,        
although we believe proceedings are not likely to have a material adverse effect
on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform
under their contracts with the Funds, these proceedings are subject to          
uncertainties and, as such, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range
of loss that may result. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings 
could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other relief
that could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial         
condition or results of operations of Ameriprise Financial.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF                                   
RIVERSOURCE INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES FUND:                                

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including 
the portfolio of investments, of RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund
(the Fund) (one of the portfolios constituting the RiverSource Bond Series,     
Inc.) as of July 31, 2008, and the related statement of operations for the year 
then ended, the statements of changes in net assets and the financial highlights
for each of the two years in the period then ended. These financial statements  
and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our   
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and       
financial highlights based on our audits. The financial highlights of the Fund  
for the periods presented through July 31, 2006, were audited by other auditors 
whose report dated September 20, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial highlights.                                                           

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company  
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were  
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial   
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial 
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the          
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.          
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used   
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall        
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of       
securities owned as of July 31, 2008, by correspondence with the custodian and  
brokers, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers 
were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights audited by us 
as referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial    
position of RiverSource Inflation Protected Securities Fund of the RiverSource  
Bond Series, Inc. at July 31, 2008, the results of its operations for the year  
then ended, and changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for each 
of the two years in the period then ended in conformity with U.S. generally     
accepted accounting principles.

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES                                      
AGREEMENT ----------------------------------------------------------------------

RiverSource Investments, LLC ("RiverSource Investments" or the "investment      
manager"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise 
Financial"), serves as the investment manager to the Fund. Under an investment  
management services agreement (the "IMS Agreement") RiverSource Investments     
provides investment advice and other services to the Fund and all RiverSource   
funds (collectively, the "Funds").                                              

On an annual basis, the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board"), including the  
independent Board members (the "Independent Directors"), considers renewal of   
the IMS Agreement. RiverSource Investments prepared detailed reports for the    
Board and its Contracts Committee in March and April 2008, including reports    
based on data provided by independent organizations to assist the Board in      
making this determination. In addition, throughout the year, the Board (or its  
committees) reviews information prepared by RiverSource Investments addressing  
the services RiverSource Investments provides and Fund performance. The Board   
accords particular weight to the work, deliberations and conclusions of the     
Contracts, Investment Review and Compliance Committees in determining whether to
continue the IMS Agreement. At the April 9-10, 2008 in-person Board meeting,    
independent legal counsel to the Independent Directors reviewed with the        
Independent Directors various factors relevant to the Board's consideration of  
advisory agreements and the Board's legal responsibilities related to such      
consideration. Following an analysis and discussion of the factors identified   
below, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, approved renewal  
of the IMS Agreement.                                                           

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided by RiverSource Investments:  The
Board analyzed various reports and presentations it had received detailing the  
services performed by RiverSource Investments, as well as its expertise,        
resources and capabilities. The Board specifically considered many developments 
during the past year concerning the services provided by RiverSource            
Investments, including, in particular, the continued investment in, and         
resources dedicated to, the Fund's operations, particularly in the areas of     
trading systems, new product initiatives, legal and compliance. Further, in     
connection with the Board's evaluation of the overall package of services       
provided by RiverSource Investments, the Board considered the quality of the    
administrative and transfer agency services provided by RiverSource Investments'
affiliates to the Fund. The Board also reviewed the financial condition of      
RiverSource Investments (and its affiliates) and each entity's ability to carry 
out its responsibilities under the IMS Agreement. The Board also discussed the  
acceptability of the terms of the IMS Agreement (including the relatively broad 
scope of services required to be performed by RiverSource Investments). The     
Board concluded that the services

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES                                      
AGREEMENT (continued) ----------------------------------------------------------

being performed under the IMS Agreement were of a reasonably high quality,      
particularly in light of recent market conditions.                              

Based on the foregoing, and based on other information received (both oral and  
written, including the information on investment performance referenced below)  
and other considerations, the Board concluded that RiverSource Investments and  
its affiliates were in a position to continue to provide a high quality and     
level of services to the Fund.                                                  

Investment Performance:  For purposes of evaluating the nature, extent and      
quality of services provided under the IMS Agreement, the Board carefully       
reviewed the investment performance of the Fund. In this regard, the Board      
considered: (i) detailed reports containing data prepared by an independent     
organization showing, for various periods, the performance of the Fund, the     
performance of a benchmark index, the percentage ranking of the Fund among its  
comparison group and the net assets of the Fund; and (ii) a report detailing the
Fund's performance over various periods (including since inception), recent Fund
inflows (and outflows) and a comparison of the Fund's net assets from December  
2006 to December 2007. The Board observed that the Fund's investment performance
met expectations.                                                               

Comparative Fees, Costs of Services Provided and the Profits Realized By        
RiverSource Investments and its Affiliates from their Relationships with the    
Fund:  The Board reviewed comparative fees and the costs of services to be      
provided under the IMS Agreement. The Board members considered detailed         
comparative information set forth in an annual report on fees and expenses,     
including, among other things, data (prepared by an independent organization)   
showing a comparison of the Fund's expenses with median expenses paid by funds  
in its peer group, as well as data showing the Fund's contribution to           
RiverSource Investments' profitability.                                         

The Board accorded particular weight to the notion that the level of fees should
reflect a rational pricing model applied consistently across the various product
lines in the Funds' family, while assuring that the overall fees for each fund  
are generally in line with the "pricing philosophy" (i.e., that the total       
expense ratio of each fund, with few exceptions, is at or below the median      
expense ratio of funds in the same comparison group). The Board took into       
account that the Fund's total expense ratio (after considering proposed expense 
caps/waivers) was slightly below the peer group's median expense ratio shown in 
the reports. Based on its review, the Board concluded that the Fund's management
fee was fair and reasonable in light of the extent and quality of services that 
the Fund receives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Board also considered the expected profitability of RiverSource Investments 
and its affiliates in connection with RiverSource Investments providing         
investment management services to the Fund. In this regard, the Board referred  
to a detailed profitability report, discussing the profitability to RiverSource 
Investments and Ameriprise Financial from managing and operating the Fund,      
including data showing comparative profitability over the past two years. The   
Board also considered the services acquired by the investment manager through   
the use of commission dollars paid by the Funds on portfolio transactions. The  
Board noted that the fees paid by the Fund should permit the investment manager 
to offer competitive compensation to its personnel, make necessary investments  
in its business and earn an appropriate profit. The Board concluded that        
profitability levels were reasonable.                                           

Economies of Scale to be Realized:  The Board also considered the economies of  
scale that might be realized by RiverSource Investments as the Fund grows and   
took note of the extent to which Fund shareholders might also benefit from such 
growth. The Board considered that the IMS Agreement provides for lower fees as  
assets increase at pre-established breakpoints and concluded that the IMS       
Agreement satisfactorily provided for sharing these economies of scale.         

Based on the foregoing, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors,  
concluded that the investment management service fees were fair and reasonable  
in light of the extent and quality of services provided. In reaching this       
conclusion, no single factor was determinative. On April 10, 2008, the Board,   
including all of the Independent Directors, approved the renewal of the IMS     
Agreement.

Fund holds investments consistent with the procedures as stated in the Statement

(See "The Fund's Long-term Performance" for Index descriptions)                 

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a      
guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of your  
investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more 
or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher    
than the performance information shown. You may obtain performance information  
current to the most recent month-end by contacting your financial institution or
visiting riversource.com/funds.                                                 

The 3.00% sales charge applicable to Class A shares of the Fund, which changed  
from 4.75% effective March 3, 2008, is not reflected in the table above. If     
reflected, returns would be lower than those shown. The performance of other    
classes may vary from that shown because of differences in expenses. See the    
Average Annual Total Returns table for performance of other share classes of the
Fund.                                                                           

The indices do not reflect the effects of sales charges, expenses (excluding    
Lipper) and taxes.                                                              

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

(a) The Investment Manager and its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive
certain fees and to absorb certain expenses until July 31, 2009, unless 
   sooner terminated at the discretion of the Fund's Board. Any amounts waived
   will not be reimbursed by the Fund. Under this agreement, net fund expenses
 (excluding fees and expenses of acquired funds) will not exceed 0.89% for
   Class A, 1.65% for Class B, 1.64% for Class C, 0.53% for Class I, 0.77% for
Class R4, and 0.98% for Class W.                                        

(1) WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE measures a bond's maturity, which takes into          
  consideration the possibility that the issuer may call the bond before its
maturity date.                                                          
(2) EFFECTIVE DURATION measures the sensitivity of a security's price to        
    parallel shifts in the yield curve (the graphical depiction of the levels of
    interest rates from two years out to 30 years). Positive duration means that
as rates rise, the price decreases, and negative duration means that as 
rates rise, the price increases.                                        
(3) WEIGHTED AVERAGE BOND RATING represents the average credit quality of the   
underlying bonds in the portfolio.                                      

There are risks associated with an investment in a bond fund, including credit  
risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment and extension risk. See the Fund's     
prospectus for information on these and other risks associated with the Fund. In
general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect  
is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.

On March 3, 2008, the maximum sales charge for Class A shares changed from 4.75%
to 3.00%. Class A share performance reflects the maximum sales charge of 4.75%, 
which was in effect at the beginning of all periods. Class B share performance  
reflects a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) applied as follows: first    
year 5%; second and third years 4%; fourth year 3%; fifth year 2%; sixth year   
1%; no sales charge thereafter. Class C shares may be subject to a 1% CDSC if   
shares are sold within one year after purchase. Sales charges do not apply to   
Class I, Class R4 and Class W shares. Class I and Class R4 are available to     
institutional investors only. Class W shares are offered through qualifying     
discretionary accounts.

MANAGER COMMENTARY -------------------------------------------------------------

At July 31, 2008, approximately 60% of the Fund's shares were owned in the      
aggregate by affiliated funds-of-funds managed by RiverSource Investments, LLC  
(RiverSource). As a result of asset allocation decisions by RiverSource, it is  
possible RiverSource Limited Duration Bond Fund may experience relatively large 
purchases or redemptions from affiliated funds-of-funds (see page 45, Class I   
capital share transactions for related activity during the most recent fiscal   
period). RiverSource seeks to minimize the impact of these transactions by      
structuring them over a reasonable period of time. RiverSource Limited Duration 
Bond Fund may experience increased expenses as it buys and sells securities as a
result of purchases or redemptions by affiliated funds-of-funds. For more       
information on the Fund's expenses, see the discussions beginning on pages 13   
and 41.                                                                         

Dear Shareholders:                                                              

RiverSource Limited Duration Bond Fund (the Fund) Class A shares advanced 1.56% 
(excluding sales charge) for the 12 months ended July 31, 2008. The Fund        
underperformed its benchmark, the unmanaged Lehman Brothers Intermediate        
Aggregate Bond Index (Lehman Index), which gained 6.33%. The Fund's peer group, 
as represented by the Lipper Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds     
Index, returned 3.08% during the same period.

MANAGER COMMENTARY (continued) -------------------------------------------------

SIGNIFICANT PERFORMANCE FACTORS                                                 
Chaos in the financial markets as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis and  
its aftermath impacted the Fund's performance during the annual period ended    
July 31, 2008. A classic flight to quality seized the U.S. fixed income market  
as investor aversion to risk remained generally elevated. During the last       
several months of the annual period, inflation became an additional concern for 
the fixed income market, with fuel and food prices reaching record highs. The   
Federal Reserve (the Fed) responded by taking a variety of strong and decisive  
actions. For one, the Fed embarked on an aggressive interest rate cutting       
campaign beginning in September 2007 to address tight credit markets and the    
ongoing housing market downturn. In all, the Fed cut the targeted federal funds 
rate seven times, trimming a total of 325 basis points (3.25%), bringing the    
targeted federal funds rate to 2.00%. The Fed also introduced several new tools 
to provide liquidity to the financial system at large and the mortgage market in
particular.                                                                     

For the annual period overall, interest rates fell significantly as investors   
fled riskier assets for the relative safety of U.S. Treasury securities         
(Treasuries), pushing yields sharply lower. Aside from Treasuries, other fixed  
income sectors posted positive but comparatively weaker results. The majority of
gains for virtually all of the fixed income sectors were achieved during the    
first half of the annual period, with returns during the second half rather

Bond ratings apply to the underlying holdings of the Fund and not the Fund      
itself. Whenever possible, the Standard and Poor's rating is used to determine  
the credit quality of a security. Standard and Poor's rates the creditworthiness
of corporate bonds, with 15 categories, ranging from AAA (highest) to D         
(lowest). Ratings from AA to CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+)  
or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories. 
If Standard and Poor's doesn't rate a security, then Moody's rating is used.    
RiverSource Investments, LLC, the Fund's investment manager, rates a security   
using an internal rating system when Moody's doesn't provide a rating.

anemic across the board. All told, lower quality fixed income securities        
performed worst during the period, while higher quality fixed income securities,
such as Treasuries and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), performed
best.                                                                           

The Fund's exposure to TIPS helped its performance, as yields on TIPS were      
driven lower by the Fed's dramatic easing. The TIPS market also rallied during  
the period as investors grew increasingly risk averse and sought to benefit from
heightened inflationary pressures. Effective issue selection within the         
investment grade corporate bond sector also contributed to Fund results. For    
example, the Fund had only a modest exposure to financials-related corporate    
bonds, which continued to be pressured by mounting losses and write-downs.      

Conversely, the Fund's short duration positioning relative to the Lehman Index  
hurt performance, as interest rates declined significantly over the period. That
said, active management of duration positioning as market conditions shifted did
help reduce the impact of the Fund's overall defensive stance. Duration is a    
measure of the Fund's sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Significant     
exposure to and issue selection within commercial mortgage-backed securities    
(CMBS) and residential mortgage securities further detracted from Fund          
performance, as these sectors came under increased pressure during the period   
and lagged the Lehman Index for the 12 months. Within the Fund's allocation to  
residential mortgage securities, an emphasis on non-agency mortgage-backed      
securities especially hurt. Mortgage-backed securities issued by entities other 
than government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,      
dramatically underperformed. Finally, an allocation to investment               

 We expect to maintain the Fund's emphasis on higher quality spread sectors of
the fixed income market over Treasuries.

grade corporate bonds detracted, with this sector underperforming equivalent-   
duration Treasuries for the annual period.                                      

CHANGES TO THE FUND'S PORTFOLIO                                                 
As mentioned, we adjusted the Fund's duration as market conditions shifted      
during the annual period, but left it shorter than the Lehman Index. We         
materially reduced the Fund's still-sizable positions in CMBS and non-agency    
mortgage-backed securities, as these sectors rebounded somewhat toward the end  
of the period. We also upgraded the credit quality of these holdings and        
eliminated the Fund's exposure to lower-rated CMBS. We deployed proceeds from   
these sales into investment grade corporate bonds and U.S. agency securities.   
Valuations in the investment grade corporate bond sector in particular were     
attractive compared with long-term averages. The Fund's portfolio turnover rate 
for the 12-month period was 218%.*                                              

OUR FUTURE STRATEGY                                                             
At the end of the annual period, prices of many securities in the non-Treasury  
sectors of the fixed income market reflected expectations of a prolonged        
economic slowdown. However, we do not believe this is the most likely outcome   
for the economy. Over the 12-month period, both Congress and the Fed took       
meaningful policy actions that, in our view, will begin to take effect during   
the remainder of 2008. At the same time, with Treasury rates near historic lows,
they appear to have little room to decline further.                             

With this backdrop, we intend to maintain the Fund's shorter-than-Lehman Index  
duration positioning for the near term. We further intend to maintain the Fund's
exposure to TIPS, which we believe will perform well given our view for         
inflation. We expect to maintain the Fund's emphasis on higher quality spread   
sectors of the fixed income market over Treasuries. Within the spread sectors,  
we currently intend to maintain the Fund's allocation to residential mortgage-  
backed securities and CMBS, as we believe prices of these high quality mortgage 
assets at the end of the annual period represented significant value to the     
portfolio. U.S. agency bonds also remained attractive, as recent federal actions
signaled strong U.S. Treasury support of these institutions and their debt.     
While non-Treasury sectors of the fixed income market may not see a complete    
rebound in the next few months, we believe it is reasonable to

expect notable upside. This belief stems from our opinion that the large-scale  
federal actions will work their way into the system, the economy will begin to  
stabilize, liquidity will gradually return to the market and relative pricing   
will eventually recover.                                                        

As we still expect volatility within the fixed income markets to continue       
through the remainder of 2008, we will continue to closely monitor Fed policy   
shifts, economic data releases, supply/demand factors and interest rate         
movements and adjust the portfolio's holdings and duration stance if necessary.

* A significant portion of portfolio turnover was the result of "roll"          
 transactions in liquid derivatives and Treasury securities. In the derivative
transactions, positions in expiring contracts were liquidated and           
simultaneously replaced with positions in new contracts with equivalent     
 characteristics. In the Treasury transactions, existing holdings were sold to
  purchase newly issued securities with slightly longer maturity dates. Although
these transactions affect the turnover rate of the portfolio, they do not   
change the risk exposure or result in material transactions costs. The      
remaining turnover resulted from strategic reallocations and relative value 
trading. After transaction costs, we expect this activity to enhance overall
returns for the Fund.

THE FUND'S LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE -----------------------------------------------

The chart on the facing page illustrates the total value of an assumed $10,000  
investment in RiverSource Limited Duration Bond Fund Class A shares (from 7/1/03
to 7/31/08)* as compared to the performance of two widely cited performance     
indices, the Lehman Brothers Intermediate Aggregate Bond Index and the Lipper   
Short-Intermediate Investment Grade Debt Funds Index. In comparing the Fund's   
Class A shares to these indices, you should take into account the fact that the 
Fund's performance reflects the maximum sales charge of 4.75%, which changed to 
3.00% effective March 3, 2008. Such charges are not reflected in the performance
of the indices. Returns for the Fund include the reinvestment of any            
distribution paid during each period.                                           

The performance information shown represents past performance and is not a      
guarantee of future results. The table below and the chart on the facing page do
not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund         
distributions or the redemption of fund shares. The investment return and       
principal value of your investment will fluctuate so that your shares, when     
redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current           
performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. You  
may obtain performance information current to the most recent month-end by

FUND EXPENSES EXAMPLE ----------------------------------------------------------
(UNAUDITED)                                                                     

As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction     
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase payments; and (2) ongoing    
costs, which may include management fees; distribution and service (12b-1) fees;
and other Fund fees and expenses. This example is intended to help you          
understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to      
compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.  
In addition to the ongoing expenses which the Fund bears directly, the Fund's   
shareholders indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which it invests (also
referred to as "acquired funds"), including affiliated and non-affiliated pooled
investment vehicles (including mutual funds and exchange traded funds). The     
Fund's indirect expense from investing in the acquired funds is based on the    
Fund's pro rata portion of the cumulative expenses charged by the acquired funds
using the expense ratio of each of the acquired funds as of the acquired fund's 
most recent shareholder report.                                                 

The example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the six months ended July 31, 2008.                         

ACTUAL EXPENSES                                                                 
The first line of the table provides information about actual account values and
actual expenses. You may use the information in this line, together with the    
amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period.    
Simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value
divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the first   
line under the heading titled "Expenses paid during the period" to estimate the 
expenses you paid on your account during this period.                           

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES                                    
The second line of the table provides information about hypothetical account    
values and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and an
assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Fund's  
actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to  
estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. 
You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the   
Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5%
hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.

Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your    
ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as sales    
charges (loads). Therefore, the second line of the table is useful in comparing 
ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of 
owning different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included,

(a) Expenses are equal to the Fund's annualized expense ratio as indicated      
  above, multiplied by the average account value over the period, multiplied
by 182/366 (to reflect the one-half year period).                       
(b) Based on the actual return for the six months ended July 31, 2008: -2.67%   
for Class A, -3.05% for Class B, -2.94% for Class C, -2.49% for Class I,
-2.38% for Class R4 and -2.61% for Class W.                             
(c) The Investment Manager and its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive
certain fees and to absorb certain expenses until July 31, 2009, unless 
sooner terminated at the discretion of the Fund's Board, such that net  
 expenses (excluding fees and expenses of acquired funds), will not exceed
   0.89% for Class A, 1.65% for Class B, 1.64% for Class C, 0.53% for Class I,
0.77% for Class R4 and 0.98% for Class W. Any amounts waived will not be
reimbursed by the Fund. This change was effective Aug. 1, 2008. Had this
 change been in place for the entire six month period ended July 31, 2008,
the actual expenses paid would have been $2.60 for Class I and $4.81 for
 Class W; the hypothetical expenses paid would have been $2.66 for Class I
  and $4.92 for Class W. The actual and hypothetical expenses paid for Class
   A, Class B, Class C and Class R4 would have been the same as those expenses
presented in the table above.

NOTES TO PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENTS                                               

(a)  Securities are valued by using procedures described in Note 1 to the       
financial statements.                                                 

(b)  At July 31, 2008, the cost of securities purchased, including interest     
purchased, on a when-issued and/or other forward-commitment basis was 
$21,628,351. See Note 1 to the financial statements.                  

(c)  Foreign security values are stated in U.S. dollars. For debt securities,   
    principal amounts are denominated in U.S. dollar currency unless otherwise
   noted. At July 31, 2008, the value of foreign securities represented 5.4%
of net assets.                                                        

(d)  Represents a security sold under Rule 144A, which is exempt from           
  registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. This security
   may be determined to be liquid under guidelines established by the Fund's
   Board of Directors. These securities may be resold in transactions exempt
    from registration, normally to qualified institutional buyers. At July 31,
2008, the value of these securities amounted to $8,856,917 or 5.0% of net
assets.                                                               

(e)  Inflation-indexed bonds are securities in which the principal amount is    
   adjusted for inflation and the semiannual interest payments equal a fixed
percentage of the inflation-adjusted principal amount.                

(f)  Mortgage-backed securities represent direct or indirect participations in, 
or are secured by and payable from, mortgage loans secured by real    
   property, and include single- and multi-class pass-through securities and
collateralized mortgage obligations. These securities may be issued or
    guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities, or by private
   issuers, generally originators and investors in mortgage loans, including
savings associations, mortgage bankers, commercial banks, investment  
  bankers and special purpose entities. The maturity dates shown represent
 the original maturity of the underlying obligation. Actual maturity may
    vary based upon prepayment activity on these obligations. Unless otherwise
noted, the coupon rates presented are fixed rates.

(g)  Interest only represents securities that entitle holders to receive only   
    interest payments on the underlying mortgages. The yield to maturity of an

   may have an adverse (positive) effect on yield to maturity. The principal
   amount shown is the notional amount of the underlying mortgages. Interest
    rate disclosed represents yield based upon the estimated timing and amount
of future cash flows at July 31, 2008.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS --------------------------------------------------

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                   

RiverSource Limited Duration Bond Fund (the Fund) is a series of RiverSource    
Bond Series, Inc. and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (as
amended) as a diversified, open-end management investment company. RiverSource  
Bond Series, Inc. has 10 billion authorized shares of capital stock that can be 
allocated among the separate series as designated by the Board of Directors (the
Board). The Fund invests primarily in securities like those included in the     
Lehman Brothers Intermediate Aggregate Bond Index (the Index). The Index        
includes securities issued by the U.S. government, corporate bonds, and         
mortgage- and asset-backed securities.                                          

The Fund offers Class A, Class B, Class C, Class I, Class R4 and Class W shares.

-  Class A shares are sold with a front-end sales charge.                       

-  Class B shares may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC)   
and automatically convert to Class A shares during the ninth year of      
ownership. Effective March 3, 2008, Class B shares were closed to new     
investors and new purchases.                                              

-  Class C shares may be subject to a CDSC.                                     

-  Class I and Class R4 shares are sold without a front-end sales charge or CDSC
and are offered to qualifying institutional investors.                    

-  Class W shares are sold without a front-end sales charge or CDSC and are     
offered through qualifying discretionary accounts.                        

At July 31, 2008, RiverSource Life Insurance Company (RiverSource Life), a      
wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial),   
parent company of RiverSource Investments, LLC (RiverSource Investments or the  
Investment Manager) owned 100% of Class R4 shares. The Investment Manager and   
the RiverSource affiliated funds-of-funds owned 100% of Class I shares and the  
Investment Manager owned 100% of Class W shares.                                

At July 31, 2008, RiverSource Life, the Investment Manager and the RiverSource  
affiliated funds-of-funds owned approximately 60% of the total outstanding Fund 
shares.                                                                         

All classes of shares have identical voting, dividend and liquidation rights.   
Class specific expenses (e.g., distribution and service fees, transfer agency   
fees, plan administration services fees) differ among classes. Income, expenses 
(other than class specific expenses) and realized and unrealized gains or losses
on investments are allocated to each class of shares based upon its relative net
assets.

P-->N-CSR211th Page of 245TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 211th
The Fund's significant accounting policies are summarized below:                

USE OF ESTIMATES                                                                
Preparing financial statements that conform to U.S. generally accepted          
accounting principles requires management to make estimates (e.g., on assets,   
liabilities and contingent assets and liabilities) that could differ from actual
results.                                                                        

VALUATION OF SECURITIES 
All securities are valued at the close of each business day. Securities traded  
on national securities exchanges or included in national market systems are     
valued at the last quoted sales price. Debt securities are generally traded in  
the over-the-counter market and are valued at a price that reflects fair value  
as quoted by dealers in these securities or by an independent pricing service.  
Foreign securities are valued based on quotations from the principal market in  
which such securities are normally traded. The procedures adopted by the Board  
generally contemplate the use of fair valuation in the event that price         
quotations or valuations are not readily available, price quotations or         
valuations from other sources are not reflective of market value and thus deemed
unreliable, or a significant event has occurred in relation to a security or    
class of securities (such as foreign securities) that is not reflected in price 
quotations or valuations from other sources. A fair value price is a good faith 
estimate of the value of a security at a given point in time.                   

Many securities markets and exchanges outside the U.S. close prior to the close 
of the New York Stock Exchange and therefore the closing prices for securities  
in such markets or on such exchanges may not fully reflect events that occur    
after such close but before the close of the New York Stock Exchange, including 
significant movements in the U.S. market after foreign exchanges have closed.   
Accordingly, in those situations, Ameriprise Financial, as administrator to the 
Fund, will fair value foreign securities pursuant to procedures adopted by the  
Board, including utilizing a third party pricing service to determine these fair
values. These procedures take into account multiple factors, including movements
in the U.S. securities markets, to determine a good faith estimate that         
reasonably reflects the current market conditions as of the close of the New    
York Stock Exchange. Swap transactions are valued through an authorized pricing 
service, broker, or an internal model.                                          

Short-term securities maturing in more than 60 days from the valuation date are 
valued at the market price or approximate market value based on current interest
rates; those maturing in 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost.          

ILLIQUID SECURITIES                                                             
At July 31, 2008, investments in securities included issues that are illiquid   
which the Fund currently limits to 15% of net assets, at market value, at the   
time of purchase. The aggregate value of such securities at July 31, 2008 was   
$6,786 representing 0.004% of net assets. These securities may be valued at fair
value according to procedures approved, in good faith, by the Board. According  
to

Board guidelines, certain unregistered securities are determined to be liquid   
and are not included within the 15% limitation specified above. Assets are      
liquid if they can be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business    
within seven days at approximately the value at which the asset is valued by the
Fund.                                                                           

SECURITIES PURCHASED ON A FORWARD-COMMITMENT BASIS                              
Delivery and payment for securities that have been purchased by the Fund on a   
forward-commitment basis, including when-issued securities and other forward-   
commitments, can take place one month or more after the transaction date. During
this period, such securities are subject to market fluctuations, and they may   
affect the Fund's net assets the same as owned securities. The Fund designates  
cash or liquid securities at least equal to the amount of its forward-          
commitments. At July 31, 2008, the Fund has outstanding when-issued securities  
of $21,628,351.                                                                 

The Fund also enters into transactions to sell purchase commitments to third    
parties at current market values and concurrently acquires other purchase       
commitments for similar securities at later dates. As an inducement for the Fund
to "roll over" its purchase commitments, the Fund receives negotiated amounts in
the form of reductions of the purchase price of the commitment. The Fund records
the incremental difference between the forward purchase and sale of each forward
roll as realized gain or loss. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of  
the securities or if a counterparty does not perform under the terms of the     
agreement. If a counterparty files for bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, the     
Fund's right to repurchase or sell securities may be limited.                   

OPTION TRANSACTIONS                                                             
To produce incremental earnings, protect gains, and facilitate buying and       
selling of securities for investments, the Fund may buy and write options traded
on any U.S. or foreign exchange or in the over-the-counter market where         
completing the obligation depends upon the credit standing of the other party.  
Cash collateral may be collected by the Fund to secure certain over-the counter 
options trades. Cash collateral held by the Fund for such option trades must be 
returned to the counterparty upon closure, exercise or expiration of the        
contract. The Fund also may buy and sell put and call options and write covered 
call options on portfolio securities as well as write cash-secured put options. 
The risk in writing a call option is that the Fund gives up the opportunity for 
profit if the market price of the security increases. The risk in writing a put 
option is that the Fund may incur a loss if the market price of the security    
decreases and the option is exercised. The risk in buying an option is that the 
Fund pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised. The Fund also has   
the additional risk of being unable to enter into a closing transaction if a    
liquid secondary market does not exist.                                         

Option contracts are valued daily at the closing prices on their primary        
exchanges and unrealized appreciation or depreciation is recorded. The Fund will
realize a gain or loss when the option transaction expires or closes. When      
options on debt

securities or futures are exercised, the Fund will realize a gain or loss. When 
other options are exercised, the proceeds on sales for a written call option,   
the purchase cost for a written put option or the cost of a security for a      
purchased put or call option is adjusted by the amount of premium received or   
paid. At July 31, 2008, and for the year then ended, the Fund had no outstanding
option contracts.                                                               

FUTURES TRANSACTIONS                                                            
To gain exposure to or protect itself from market changes, the Fund may buy and 
sell financial futures contracts traded on any U.S. or foreign exchange. The    
Fund also may buy or write put and call options on these futures contracts.     
Risks of entering into futures contracts and related options include the        
possibility of an illiquid market and that a change in the value of the contract
or option may not correlate with changes in the value of the underlying         
securities.                                                                     

Futures are valued daily based upon the last sale price at the close of market  
on the principal exchange on which they are traded. Upon entering into a futures
contract, the Fund is required to deposit either cash or securities in an amount
(initial margin) equal to a certain percentage of the contract value. Subsequent
payments (variation margin) are made or received by the Fund each day. The      
variation margin payments are equal to the daily changes in the contract value  
and are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. The Fund recognizes a realized 
gain or loss when the contract is closed or expires.                            

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS AND FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS 
Securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies   
are translated daily into U.S. dollars. Foreign currency amounts related to the 
purchase or sale of securities and income and expenses are translated at the    
exchange rate on the transaction date. The effect of changes in foreign exchange
rates on realized and unrealized security gains or losses is reflected as a     
component of such gains or losses. In the Statement of Operations, net realized 
gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, if any, may arise from sales
of foreign currency, closed forward contracts, exchange gains or losses realized
between the trade date and settlement date on securities transactions, and other
translation gains or losses on dividends, interest income and foreign           
withholding taxes.                                                              

The Fund may enter into forward foreign currency contracts for operational      
purposes and to protect against adverse exchange rate fluctuation. The net U.S. 
dollar value of foreign currency underlying all contractual commitments held by 
the Fund and the resulting unrealized appreciation or depreciation are          
determined using foreign currency exchange rates from an independent pricing    
service. The Fund is subject to the credit risk that the other party will not   
complete its contract obligations. At July 31, 2008, the Fund had no outstanding
forward foreign currency contracts.

FORWARD SALE COMMITMENTS                                                        
The Fund may enter into forward sale commitments to hedge its portfolio         
positions or to sell mortgage-backed securities it owns under delayed delivery  
arrangements. Proceeds of forward sale commitments are not received until the   
contractual settlement date. During the time a forward sale commitment is       
outstanding, equivalent deliverable securities, or an offsetting forward        
purchase commitment deliverable on or before the sale commitment date, are used 
to satisfy the commitment.                                                      

Unsettled forward sale commitments are valued at the current market value of the
underlying securities, generally according to the procedures described under    
"Valuation of securities" above. The forward sale commitment is "marked-to-     
market" daily and the change in market value is recorded by the Fund as an      
unrealized gain or loss. If the forward sale commitment is closed through the   
acquisition of an offsetting purchase commitment, the Fund realizes a gain or   
loss. If the Fund delivers securities under the commitment, the Fund realizes a 
gain or a loss from the sale of the securities based upon the market price      
established at the date the commitment was entered into. Forward sale           
commitments outstanding at period end are listed in the Notes to Portfolio of   
Investments.                                                                    

CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP TRANSACTIONS                                                
The Fund may enter into credit default swap contracts to increase or decrease   
its credit exposure to an issuer, obligation, portfolio, or index of issuers or 
obligations, to hedge its exposure on an obligation that it owns or in lieu of  
selling such obligations. As the purchaser of a credit default swap contract,   
the Fund purchases protection by paying a periodic interest rate on the notional
amount to the counterparty. The interest amount is accrued daily as a component 
of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and is recorded as a realized loss    
upon payment. If the credit event specified in the contract occurs, the Fund    
will be required to deliver either the referenced obligation or an equivalent   
cash amount to the protection seller and in exchange the Fund will receive the  
notional amount from the seller. The difference between the value of the        
obligation delivered and the notional amount received will be recorded as a     
realized gain (loss). As the seller of a credit default swap contract, the Fund 
sells protection to a buyer and will generally receive a periodic interest rate 
on the notional amount. The interest amount is accrued daily as a component of  
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) and is recorded as a realized gain upon  
receipt of the payment. If the credit event specified in the contract occurs,   
the Fund will receive the referenced obligation or an equivalent cash amount in 
exchange for the payment of the notional amount to the protection buyer. The    
difference between the value of the obligation received and the notional amount 
paid will be recorded as a realized gain (loss). As a protection seller, the    
maximum amount of the payment made by the Fund may equal the notional amount, at
par, of the underlying index or security as a result of the related credit      
event.

P-->N-CSR215th Page of 245TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 215th
The notional amounts of credit default swap contracts are not recorded in the   
financial statements. Any premium paid or received by the Fund upon entering    
into a credit default swap contract is recorded as an asset or liability and    
amortized daily as a component of realized gain (loss) on the Statement of      
Operations. At July 31, 2008, there were no credit default swap contracts       
outstanding which had a premium paid or received by the Fund. Credit default    
swap contracts are valued daily, and the change in value is recorded as         
unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the termination of the swap, at    
which time a realized gain (loss) is recorded.                                  

Credit default swap contracts can involve greater risks than if a fund had      
invested in the reference obligation directly since, in addition to general     
market risks, credit default swaps are subject to counterparty credit risk,     
leverage risk, hedging risk, correlation risk and liquidity risk. The Fund will 
enter into credit default swap agreements only with counterparties that meet    
certain standards of creditworthiness.                                          

GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS                                                 
Under the Fund's organizational documents, its officers and directors are       
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their 
duties to the Fund. In addition, certain of the Fund's contracts with its       
service providers contain general indemnification clauses. The Fund's maximum   
exposure under these arrangements is unknown since the amount of any future     
claims that may be made against the Fund cannot be determined and the Fund has  
no historical basis for predicting the likelihood of any such claims.           

FEDERAL TAXES                                                                   
The Fund's policy is to comply with Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code   
that applies to regulated investment companies and to distribute substantially  
all of its taxable income to shareholders. No provision for income or excise    
taxes is thus required.                                                         

Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation 48 (FIN 48),         
"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes," clarifies the accounting for      
uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB Statement 109,   
"Accounting for Income Taxes." FIN 48 prescribes a two-step process to recognize
and measure a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The   
first step is to determine whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than- 
not recognition threshold and the second step is to measure a tax position that 
meets the threshold to determine the amount of benefit to recognize. Management 
of the Fund has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions 
that would require recognition in the financial statements. Generally, the tax  
authorities can examine all the tax returns filed for the last three years.     

Net investment income (loss) and net realized gains (losses) may differ for     
financial statement and tax purposes primarily because of futures contracts,    
recognition of unrealized appreciation (depreciation) for certain derivative

investments, post-October losses, and losses deferred due to wash sales. The    
character of distributions made during the year from net investment income or   
net realized gains may differ from their ultimate characterization for federal  
income tax purposes. Also, due to the timing of dividend distributions, the     
fiscal year in which amounts are distributed may differ from the year that the  
income or realized gains (losses) were recorded by the Fund.                    

On the Statement of Assets and Liabilities, as a result of permanent book-to-tax
differences, undistributed net investment income has been decreased by $449,796 
and accumulated net realized loss has been decreased by $449,796.               

The tax character of distributions paid for the years indicated is as follows:

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS                                                
In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.  
161 (SFAS 161), "Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging           
Activities -- an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133," which requires enhanced  
disclosures about a fund's derivative and hedging activities. Funds are required
to provide enhanced disclosures about (a) how and why a fund uses derivative    
instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are        
accounted for under SFAS 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how       
derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a fund's financial       
position, financial performance, and cash flows. SFAS 161 is effective for      
financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
Nov. 15, 2008. As of July 31, 2008, management does not believe the adoption of 
SFAS 161 will impact the financial statement amounts; however, additional       
footnote disclosures may be required about the use of derivative instruments and
hedging items.                                                                  

On Sept. 20, 2006, the FASB released Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 157 "Fair Value Measurements" (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 establishes an           
authoritative definition of fair value, sets out a hierarchy for measuring fair 
value, and requires additional disclosures about the inputs used to develop the 
measurements of fair value and the effect of certain measurements reported in   
the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period. The application of SFAS 157    
will be effective for the Fund's fiscal year beginning Aug. 1, 2008. The        
adoption of SFAS 157 is not anticipated to have a material impact on the Fund's 
financial statements; however, additional disclosures will be required about the
inputs used to develop the measurements of fair value and the effect of certain 
measurements reported in the Statement of Operations for a fiscal period.       

DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                       
Dividends from net investment income, declared daily and payable monthly, when  
available, are reinvested in additional shares of the Fund at net asset value or
payable in cash. Capital gains, when available, are distributed along with the  
last income dividend of the calendar year.                                      

OTHER                                                                           
Security transactions are accounted for on the date securities are purchased or 
sold. Dividend income is recognized on the ex-date and interest income,         
including amortization of premium, market discount and original issue discount  
using the effective interest method, is accrued daily.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES FEES                                             
Under an Investment Management Services Agreement, the Investment Manager       
determines which securities will be purchased, held or sold. The management fee 
is a percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets that declines from 0.48% 
to

0.29% annually as the Fund's assets increase. The management fee for the year   
ended July 31, 2008 was 0.48% of the Fund's average daily net assets.           

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES FEES                                                    
Under an Administrative Services Agreement, the Fund pays Ameriprise Financial a
fee for administration and accounting services at a percentage of the Fund's    
average daily net assets that declines from 0.07% to 0.04% annually as the      
Fund's assets increase. The fee for the year ended July 31, 2008 was 0.07% of   
the Fund's average daily net assets.                                            

OTHER FEES                                                                      
Other expenses are for, among other things, certain expenses of the Fund or the 
Board including: Fund boardroom and office expense, employee compensation,      
employee health and retirement benefits, and certain other expenses. Payment of 
these Fund and Board expenses is facilitated by a company providing limited     
administrative services to the Funds and the Board. For the year ended July 31,
2008, other expenses paid to this company were $443.                            

COMPENSATION OF BOARD MEMBERS                                                   
Compensation of board members includes, for a former Board Chair, compensation  
as well as retirement benefits. Certain other aspects of a former Board Chair's 
compensation, including health benefits and payment of certain other expenses,  
are included under other expenses.                                              

Under a Deferred Compensation Plan (the Plan), non-interested board members may 
defer receipt of their compensation. Deferred amounts are treated as though     
equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the Fund or other      
RiverSource funds. The Fund's liability for these amounts is adjusted for market

Plan.                                                                           

TRANSFER AGENCY FEES                                                            
Under a Transfer Agency Agreement, RiverSource Service Corporation (the Transfer

for Class B and $21.00 for Class C for this service. The Fund also pays the

The Transfer Agent charges an annual fee of $5 per inactive account, charged on 
a pro rata basis for 12 months from the date the account becomes inactive. These
fees are included in the transfer agency fees on the Statement of Operations.

PLAN ADMINISTRATION SERVICES FEES                                               
Under a Plan Administration Services Agreement with the Transfer Agent, the Fund
pays an annual fee at a rate of 0.25% of the Fund's average daily net assets    
attributable to Class R4 shares for the provision of various administrative,    
recordkeeping, communication and educational services.                          

DISTRIBUTION FEES                                                               
The Fund has an agreement with RiverSource Distributors, Inc. (the Distributor) 
for distribution and shareholder services. Prior to Oct. 1, 2007, Ameriprise    
Financial Services, Inc. also served as a principal underwriter and distributor 
to the Fund. Under a Plan and Agreement of Distribution pursuant to Rule 12b-1, 
the Fund pays a fee at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of the Fund's average daily
net assets attributable to Class A and Class W shares and a fee at an annual    
rate of up to 1.00% of the Fund's average daily net assets attributable to Class
B and Class C shares. For Class B and Class C shares, up to 0.75% of the fee is 
reimbursed for distribution expenses.                                           

The amount of distribution expenses incurred by the Distributor and not yet     
reimbursed ("unreimbursed expense") was approximately $272,000 and $11,000 for  
Class B and Class C shares, respectively. These amounts are based on the most   
recent information available as of July 31, 2008, and may be recovered from     
future payments under the distribution plan or CDSC. To the extent the          
unreimbursed expense has been fully recovered, the distribution fee is reduced. 

SALES CHARGES                                                                   
Sales charges received by the Distributor for distributing Fund shares were     
$78,644 for Class A, $13,558 for Class B and $53 for Class C for the year ended 
July 31, 2008.

expenses such that net expenses (excluding fees and expenses of acquired funds*)
would not exceed the following percentage of the Fund's average daily net

contractually agreed to waive certain fees and expenses until July 31, 2009,    
unless sooner terminated at the discretion of the Board, such that net expenses 
(excluding fees and expenses of acquired funds*) will not exceed the following  
percentage of the Fund's average daily net assets:

(*) In addition to the fees and expenses which the Fund bears directly, the Fund
  indirectly bears a pro rata share of the fees and expenses of the funds in
which it invests (also referred to as "acquired funds"), including      
  affiliated and non-affiliated pooled investment vehicles (including mutual
funds and exchange traded funds). Because the acquired funds have varied
expense and fee levels and the Fund may own different proportions of    
   acquired funds at different times, the amount of fees and expenses incurred
indirectly by the Fund will vary.                                       

EARNINGS AND BANK FEE CREDITS                                                   
During the year ended July 31, 2008, the Fund's custodian and transfer agency   
fees were reduced by $1,150 as a result of earnings and bank fee credits from   
overnight cash balances. The Fund pays custodian fees to Ameriprise Trust       
Company, a subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial.

5. AFFILIATED MONEY MARKET FUND                                                 

The Fund may invest its daily cash balance in RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund, 
a money market fund established for the exclusive use of the RiverSource funds  
and other institutional clients of RiverSource Investments. The cost of the     
Fund's purchases and proceeds from sales of shares of the RiverSource Short-Term
Cash Fund aggregated $84,841,693 and $72,978,179, respectively, for the year    
ended July 31, 2008. The income distributions received with respect to the      
Fund's investment in RiverSource Short-Term Cash Fund can be found on the       
Statement of Operations and the Fund's invested balance in RiverSource Short-   
Term Cash Fund at July 31, 2008, can be found in the Portfolio of Investments.  

6. BANK BORROWINGS                                                              

The Fund has entered into a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
headed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMCB), whereby the Fund may borrow for the
temporary funding of shareholder redemptions or for other temporary or emergency
purposes. The credit facility became effective on                               

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oct. 18, 2007, replacing a prior credit facility. The credit facility agreement,
which is a collective agreement between the Fund and certain other RiverSource  
funds, severally and not jointly, permits collective borrowings up to $500      
million. Interest is charged to each Fund based on its borrowings at a rate     
equal to the federal funds rate plus 0.30%. Each borrowing under the credit     
facility matures no later than 60 days after the date of borrowing. The Fund    
also pays a commitment fee equal to its pro rata share of the amount of the     
credit facility at a rate of 0.06% per annum. Under the prior credit facility, a
Fund paid interest on its outstanding borrowings at a rate equal to either the  
higher of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.40% or the JPMCB Prime        
Commercial Lending Rate. The Fund had no borrowings during the year ended July
31, 2008.                                                                       

7. CAPITAL LOSS CARRY-OVER AND POST-OCTOBER LOSS                                

For federal income tax purposes, the Fund had a capital loss carry-over of      
$2,205,797 at July 31, 2008, that if not offset by capital gains will expire in 
2015.                                                                           

Because the measurement periods for a regulated investment company's income are 
different for excise tax purposes versus income tax purposes, special rules are 
in place to protect the amount of earnings and profits needed to support excise 
tax distributions. As a result, the Fund is permitted to treat net capital      
losses realized between Nov. 1, 2007 and its fiscal year end ("post-October     
loss") as occurring on the first day of the following tax year. At July 31,
2008, the Fund had a post-October loss of $285,416 that is treated for income   
tax purposes as occurring on Aug. 1, 2008.                                      

It is unlikely the Board will authorize a distribution of any net realized      
capital gains until the available capital loss carry-over has been offset or    
expires.

8. INFORMATION REGARDING PENDING AND SETTLED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                  

In June 2004, an action captioned John E. Gallus et al. v. American Express     
Financial Corp. and American Express Financial Advisors Inc., was filed in the  
United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs allege 
that they are investors in several American Express Company mutual funds and    
they purport to bring the action derivatively on behalf of those funds under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The plaintiffs allege that fees allegedly paid  
to the defendants by the funds for investment advisory and administrative       
services are excessive. The plaintiffs seek remedies including restitution and  
rescission of investment advisory and distribution agreements. The plaintiffs   
voluntarily agreed to transfer this case to the United States District Court for
the District of Minnesota. In response to defendants' motion to dismiss the     
complaint, the Court dismissed one of plaintiffs' four claims and granted       
plaintiffs limited discovery. Defendants moved for summary judgment in April    
2007. Summary judgment was granted in the defendants' favor on July 9, 2007. The
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals on 
August 8, 2007.                                                                 

In December 2005, without admitting or denying the allegations, American Express
Financial Corporation (AEFC, which is now known as Ameriprise Financial, Inc.   
(Ameriprise Financial)), entered into settlement agreements with the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Minnesota Department of Commerce (MDOC)       
related to market timing activities. As a result, AEFC was censured and ordered 
to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations of certain        
provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the Investment Company Act of
1940, and various Minnesota laws. AEFC agreed to pay disgorgement of $10 million
and civil money penalties of $7 million. AEFC also agreed to retain an          
independent distribution consultant to assist in developing a plan for          
distribution of all disgorgement and civil penalties ordered by the SEC in      
accordance with various undertakings detailed at                                
http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/ia-2451.pdf. Ameriprise Financial and its   
affiliates have cooperated with the SEC and the MDOC in these legal proceedings,
and have made regular reports to the RiverSource Funds' Boards of               
Directors/Trustees.                                                             

Ameriprise Financial and certain of its affiliates have historically been       
involved in a number of legal, arbitration and regulatory proceedings, including
routine litigation, class actions, and governmental actions, concerning matters 
arising in connection with the conduct of their business activities. Ameriprise 
Financial believes that the Funds are not currently the subject of, and that    
neither Ameriprise Financial nor any of its affiliates are the subject of, any  
pending legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings that are likely to have a  
material adverse effect on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or  
its affiliates to perform under their contracts with the Funds. Ameriprise      
Financial is required

to make 10-Q, 10-K and, as necessary, 8-K filings with the Securities and       
Exchange Commission on legal and regulatory matters that relate to Ameriprise   
Financial and its affiliates. Copies of these filings may be obtained by        
accessing the SEC website at www.sec.gov.                                       

There can be no assurance that these matters, or the adverse publicity          
associated with them, will not result in increased fund redemptions, reduced    
sale of fund shares or other adverse consequences to the Funds. Further,        
although we believe proceedings are not likely to have a material adverse effect
on the Funds or the ability of Ameriprise Financial or its affiliates to perform
under their contracts with the Funds, these proceedings are subject to          
uncertainties and, as such, we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range
of loss that may result. An adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings 
could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other relief
that could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial         
condition or results of operations of Ameriprise Financial.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ------------------------

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF                                   
RIVERSOURCE LIMITED DURATION BOND FUND:                                         

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including 
the portfolio of investments, of RiverSource Limited Duration Bond Fund (the    
Fund) (one of the portfolios constituting the RiverSource Bond Series, Inc.) as 
of July 31, 2008, and the related statement of operations for the year then     
ended, and statements of changes in net assets and the financial highlights for 
each of the two years in the period then ended. These financial statements and  
financial highlights are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our       
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and       
financial highlights based on our audits. The financial highlights of the Fund  
for the periods presented through July 31, 2006, were audited by other auditors 
whose report dated September 20, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial highlights.                                                           

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company  
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. We were  
not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund's internal control over financial   
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial 
reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the          
effectiveness of the Fund's internal control over financial reporting.          
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting principles used   
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall        
financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation of       
securities owned as of July 31, 2008, by correspondence with the custodian and  
brokers, or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from brokers 
were not received. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights audited by us 
as referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial    
position of RiverSource Limited Duration Bond Fund of the RiverSource Bond      
Series, Inc. at July 31, 2008, the results of its operations for the year then  
ended, and changes in its net assets and the financial highlights for each of   
the two years in the period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally       
accepted accounting principles.

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES                                      
AGREEMENT ----------------------------------------------------------------------

RiverSource Investments, LLC ("RiverSource Investments" or the "investment      
manager"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. ("Ameriprise 
Financial"), serves as the investment manager to the Fund. Under an investment  
management services agreement (the "IMS Agreement") RiverSource Investments     
provides investment advice and other services to the Fund and all RiverSource   
funds (collectively, the "Funds").                                              

On an annual basis, the Fund's Board of Directors (the "Board"), including the  
independent Board members (the "Independent Directors"), considers renewal of   
the IMS Agreement. RiverSource Investments prepared detailed reports for the    
Board and its Contracts Committee in March and April 2008, including reports    
based on data provided by independent organizations to assist the Board in      
making this determination. In addition, throughout the year, the Board (or its  
committees) reviews information prepared by RiverSource Investments addressing  
the services RiverSource Investments provides and Fund performance. The Board   
accords particular weight to the work, deliberations and conclusions of the     
Contracts, Investment Review and Compliance Committees in determining whether to
continue the IMS Agreement. At the April 9-10, 2008 in-person Board meeting,    
independent legal counsel to the Independent Directors reviewed with the        
Independent Directors various factors relevant to the Board's consideration of  
advisory agreements and the Board's legal responsibilities related to such      
consideration. Following an analysis and discussion of the factors identified   
below, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors, approved renewal  
of the IMS Agreement.                                                           

Nature, Extent and Quality of Services Provided by RiverSource Investments:  The
Board analyzed various reports and presentations it had received detailing the  
services performed by RiverSource Investments, as well as its expertise,        
resources and capabilities. The Board specifically considered many developments 
during the past year concerning the services provided by RiverSource            
Investments, including, in particular, the continued investment in, and         
resources dedicated to, the Fund's operations, particularly in the areas of     
trading systems, new product initiatives, legal and compliance. Further, in     
connection with the Board's evaluation of the overall package of services       
provided by RiverSource Investments, the Board considered the quality of the    
administrative and transfer agency services provided by RiverSource Investments'
affiliates to the Fund. The Board also reviewed the financial condition of      
RiverSource Investments (and its affiliates) and each entity's ability to carry 
out its responsibilities under the IMS Agreement. The Board also discussed the  
acceptability of the terms of the IMS Agreement (including the relatively broad 
scope of services required to be performed by RiverSource Investments). The     
Board concluded that the services

APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES                                      
AGREEMENT (continued) ----------------------------------------------------------

being performed under the IMS Agreement were of a reasonably high quality,      
particularly in light of recent market conditions.                              

Based on the foregoing, and based on other information received (both oral and  
written, including the information on investment performance referenced below)  
and other considerations, the Board concluded that RiverSource Investments and  
its affiliates were in a position to continue to provide a high quality and     
level of services to the Fund.                                                  

Investment Performance:  For purposes of evaluating the nature, extent and      
quality of services provided under the IMS Agreement, the Board carefully       
reviewed the investment performance of the Fund. In this regard, the Board      
considered: (i) detailed reports containing data prepared by an independent     
organization showing, for various periods, the performance of the Fund, the     
performance of a benchmark index, the percentage ranking of the Fund among its  
comparison group and the net assets of the Fund; and (ii) a report detailing the
Fund's performance over various periods (including since inception), recent Fund
inflows (and outflows) and a comparison of the Fund's net assets from December  
2006 to December 2007. The Board observed that the Fund's investment performance
was appropriate in light of the particular management style and market          
conditions involved.                                                            

Comparative Fees, Costs of Services Provided and the Profits Realized By        
RiverSource Investments and its Affiliates from their Relationships with the    
Fund:  The Board reviewed comparative fees and the costs of services to be      
provided under the IMS Agreement. The Board members considered detailed         
comparative information set forth in an annual report on fees and expenses,     
including, among other things, data (prepared by an independent organization)   
showing a comparison of the Fund's expenses with median expenses paid by funds  
in its peer group, as well as data showing the Fund's contribution to           
RiverSource Investments' profitability.                                         

The Board accorded particular weight to the notion that the level of fees should
reflect a rational pricing model applied consistently across the various product
lines in the Funds' family, while assuring that the overall fees for each fund  
are generally in line with the "pricing philosophy" (i.e., that the total       
expense ratio of each fund, with few exceptions, is at or below the median      
expense ratio of funds in the same comparison group). The Board took into       
account that the Fund's total expense ratio (after considering proposed expense 
caps/waivers) was below the peer group's median expense ratio shown in the      
reports. Based on its

review, the Board concluded that the Fund's management fee was fair and         
reasonable in light of the extent and quality of services that the Fund         
receives.                                                                       

The Board also considered the expected profitability of RiverSource Investments 
and its affiliates in connection with RiverSource Investments providing         
investment management services to the Fund. In this regard, the Board referred  
to a detailed profitability report, discussing the profitability to RiverSource 
Investments and Ameriprise Financial from managing and operating the Fund,      
including data showing comparative profitability over the past two years. The   
Board also considered the services acquired by the investment manager through   
the use of commission dollars paid by the Funds on portfolio transactions. The  
Board noted that the fees paid by the Fund should permit the investment manager 
to offer competitive compensation to its personnel, make necessary investments  
in its business and earn an appropriate profit. The Board concluded that        
profitability levels were reasonable.                                           

Economies of Scale to be Realized:  The Board also considered the economies of  
scale that might be realized by RiverSource Investments as the Fund grows and   
took note of the extent to which Fund shareholders might also benefit from such 
growth. The Board considered that the IMS Agreement provides for lower fees as  
assets increase at pre-established breakpoints and concluded that the IMS       
Agreement satisfactorily provided for sharing these economies of scale.         

Based on the foregoing, the Board, including all of the Independent Directors,  
concluded that the investment management service fees were fair and reasonable  
in light of the extent and quality of services provided. In reaching this       
conclusion, no single factor was determinative. On April 10, 2008, the Board,   
including all of the Independent Directors, approved the renewal of the IMS     
Agreement.
