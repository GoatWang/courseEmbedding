Reed’s 
      Inc Announces Appointment of Neal Cohane to Senior Vice President of 
      Sales and Marketing






March 25, 2008 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Reed’s, Inc. (NASDAQ:REED) announced 
      today that Neal Cohane, Senior Vice President of National Sales has been 
      appointed Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, responsible for 
      leading and coordinating all aspects of Reed’s 
      sales, distribution and marketing efforts.
    


      The appointment of Neal Cohane as Senior Vice President of Sales and 
      Marketing reflects Reed’s strategic decision 
      to re-focus its sales efforts on national chain accounts. Utilizing 
      proceeds from Reed’s 2006 IPO, the Company 
      launched into the mainstream through a comprehensive two pronged sales 
      approach. The first approach was to distribute Reed’s 
      products to local and regional retailers through large beer and beverage 
      distributors (DSD) and a team of sales people. The second approach was 
      to direct sales efforts to national chain accounts such as supermarkets, 
      club stores and other large retailers. Mr. Cohane has been in charge of 
      this second effort, national chain account sales. Mr. Cohane’s 
      national chain store success, which includes working with 3,000 natural 
      food supermarkets and 7,500 mainstream supermarkets that carry Reed’s 
      products, has resulted in a shift in the Company’s 
      focus. While the Company will continue with the development of large 
      beer and beverage distributor relationships, for the next 12-18 months 
      the Company will be refocusing its sales efforts on the growth of its 
      national supermarket chain account business which has proven to be the 
      more cost efficient and profitable sales model. Reed’s 
      sees tremendous opportunity to leverage its success in natural foods as 
      the number one, two, three and fourth top selling soft drinks, to expand 
      its position in national grocery store chain accounts. Chain stores 
      throughout the country are making room for successful products from the 
      natural foods industry in order to take advantage of the strong consumer 
      trend toward natural, better-for-you products.
    

      As part of Reed’s refocus in grocery, Rory 
      Ahearn, the former head of the Company’s DSD 
      sales efforts, has left the company. Rory was responsible for leading 
      the Company’s DSD efforts which included the 
      roll out of Reed’s products to local and 
      regional retail accounts throughout the United States. Additionally, as 
      Reed’s refocused sales efforts are less 
      personnel intensive, Reed’s is reducing its 
      DSD sales force by approximately 40%. This reduction is expected to 
      generate approximately $1.5-2.0 million in annualized expense savings.
    

“The realignment of our sales efforts serves 
      to streamline the organization and establish a more focused and 
      profitable basis from which to build the business,” 
      said Christopher Reed, Founder and CEO of Reed’s, 
      Inc. “While we continue to see value in both 
      of our sales models, we have made the strategic decision to focus our 
      current sales efforts on growing our national accounts which has proven 
      to be a more profitable and higher returning model. Reed’s 
      product is currently distributed through approximately 10,500 
      supermarkets in both mainstream and natural foods including Whole Foods, 
      Trader Joes, Safeway, Costco, to name a few. We see tremendous 
      opportunity to leverage the strength of the Reed’s 
      brand within the natural foods and mainstream marketplace to further 
      penetrate existing accounts as well as introduce our products to new 
      supermarket accounts. This will allow us to drive sales, build brand, 
      and demand for our products before reentering fully in an up and down 
      the street sales effort.”
