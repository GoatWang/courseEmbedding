OUR CUSTOMERS


Prof. Dr. Auwärter“… Our co-development of the Toxtyper™ solution has provided us with ultrafast identification of drugsand toxins using LC-MSn, for our research and service needs.”

Dr. Ying Ge“... we showed that the extreme resolution capabilities with Bruker solariX XR™ are beyond what can be achieved by other instruments.”

Dr. Böttcher “We rely on Bruker’s robust LC-MS/MS solution, the Toxtyper™, to rapidly analyze biological samples for drugs and drugs of abuse, with unprecedented accuracy”.

Isabella Felli"While focusing on the subject of IDPs, I was impressed that all we know is largely driven by the technology we have."

Malte Drescher"The main feature of the EMXnano is that is it easy to use."

Patricia Beaune"With the NMR profiling, we are using only one method, in 20 minutes, where previously it took six days."

Bernard Siow"Dr. Siow estimated that with about 30 minutes training and a good protocol, a non-MRI expert can operate the ICON"

Prof. Jonathan Sweedler"For mass spectrometry imaging, Bruker´s Technology leads the way. In particular, their MALDI imaging instruments have incredible figures of merit that other vendors don´t come close to."

Imperial College London"The latest generation of Bruker NMR instruments gives us staggering day to day and long term reproducibility and reliability of spectral acquisition, coupled with the ability to do automated digital quantification of multiple metabolites."

Prof. Craig Rice"The most vital aspect for the successful study of metallo-supramolecular self-assemblies is the production of 3D crystal structures. The solid-state 3D structure is the definitive proof of the correctness of the structure, and the chemistry related to it."

Prof. Bohari M. Yamin"... our new D8 QUEST again pushes the limits still further and we get high quality data from smaller, weakly diffracting samples in shorter space of time."

Prof. Kannan KrishnanAdvances in the field of MPI: an interview with Professor Kannan Krishnan

Prof. Paul Roesch"The Aeon 1 GHz is a breakthrough for our studies of the interaction of transcription factors with bacterial RNA-polymerase. With a molecular mass exceeding 450 kDa, this is one of the largest heteromeric protein systems ever successfully studied by NMR."

Bruker Completes Divestiture of its Gas Chromatography Product Lines


11/03/2014

Download this Press Release ()

FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
Fourth paragraph, fourth sentence of release should read: Bruker will
continue to service and support its GC-TQ and LC-TQ products
indefinitely. (instead of Bruker will continue to service and support
its GC-TQ and LC-TQ products unless Techcomp exercises its option to
acquire the services business in the next twelve months.).


The corrected release reads:

BRUKER COMPLETES DIVESTITURE OF ITS GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY PRODUCT LINES
Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ: BRKR) today announced that it completed the
divestiture of its Gas Chromatography (GC) and GC single-quadrupole
(GC-SQ) mass spectrometry products to Techcomp Europe Ltd., a subsidiary
of Techcomp (Holdings) Ltd, on October 31st, 2014. Techcomp
intends to continue to manufacture the former Bruker GC and GC-SQ SCION™
products in the Fremont, CA, factory previously occupied by Bruker’s
Chemical and Applied Markets (CAM) division.


Select Bruker CAM GC and GC-SQ sales, marketing, applications and
operations employees are expected to be offered positions with Techcomp.
Bruker will continue to provide service and support for all GC and GC-SQ
products worldwide. As part of the transaction, Techcomp has a deferred
option to acquire the service business for GC and GC-SQ products in the
next twelve months.


The GC product line divestiture is an important part of Bruker’s
restructuring of its CAM division, which was announced in July 2014. In
September 2014, Bruker’s CAM division divested its Inductively-Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) product line and service business to
Analytik Jena AG.


Additionally, Bruker is also in the process of relocating the
manufacturing of its GC triple-quadrupole and LC triple-quadrupole
(GC-TQ and LC-TQ) mass spectrometers from Fremont, CA to Bremen,
Germany. This relocation is expected to be finalized in the first half
of 2015. Bruker’s GC-TQ and LC-TQ product research and development will
be transferred to the Company’s major mass spectrometry sites in Bremen
and Billerica, MA.Bruker will continue to service and support its GC-TQ
and LC-TQ products indefinitely.

History[edit]
The company was founded on September 7, 1960, in Karlsruhe, Germany[5] as Bruker-Physik AG[4] by five people, one of them being Günther Laukien, who was a professor at the University of Karlsruhe at the time. The name Bruker originates from co-founder Emil Bruker, as Günther Laukien himself was formally not allowed to commercialize his research whilst being a professor.[5] Bruker produced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) and EMR spectroscopy equipment then. In the early 1960s, the company had around 60 employees and was growing rapidly.[6] One of the early success products was the HFX 90 NMR spectroscopy system, with three independent channels and which was also the first NRM system using only semiconductor transistors.[7] In 1969, Bruker launched the first commercial Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy system (FT-NMR) and in the 1970s the company was the first to commercialize a superconducting FT-NMR. Later, the company would expand their product range with MRI, FTIR and FT-Raman spectrometers and with mass spectrometers.[8]
In 1968, Bruker shipped NMR systems to Yale University in Connecticut. After that, demand from the United States grew, so Bruker opened an office in Elmsford, New York which marked the start of their US activities.[5] In 2008 after a corporate reorganization lasting 8 years, all divisions were merged in a unified Bruker Corporation.[5]
Günther Laukien died in 1997, his son Frank D. Laukien, is currently the CEO of Bruker.[8] His son Jörg C. Laukien, also works for the company.[9] His son Dirk D. Laukien is a former company executive.[10]

Other[edit]
In 1964, the company bought the NMR division of the Swiss Trüb-Täuber.[4]
Bruker made several offers to take over its supplier Oxford Instruments during the 1970s, but after almost a decade of negotiations, an acquisition was eventually rejected by Oxford Instruments.[28]
In 1997, the analytical X-ray division of Siemens was acquired by Bruker.[29]
In 2010 Bruker bought 3 product lines from Agilent, which Agilent had acquired from Varian.[30] These included mass spectrometry and gas chromatography instruments. They have since divested these products to Scion Instruments with the exception of the triple quadrupole[citation needed]
In 2012 Bruker bought parts of Carestream Health, including their in-vivo imaging portfolio and related aspects.[31]

History[edit]
The company was founded on September 7, 1960, in Karlsruhe, Germany[5] as Bruker-Physik AG[4] by five people, one of them being Günther Laukien, who was a professor at the University of Karlsruhe at the time. The name Bruker originates from co-founder Emil Bruker, as Günther Laukien himself was formally not allowed to commercialize his research whilst being a professor.[5] Bruker produced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) and EMR spectroscopy equipment then. In the early 1960s, the company had around 60 employees and was growing rapidly.[6] One of the early success products was the HFX 90 NMR spectroscopy system, with three independent channels and which was also the first NRM system using only semiconductor transistors.[7] In 1969, Bruker launched the first commercial Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy system (FT-NMR) and in the 1970s the company was the first to commercialize a superconducting FT-NMR. Later, the company would expand their product range with MRI, FTIR and FT-Raman spectrometers and with mass spectrometers.[8]
In 1968, Bruker shipped NMR systems to Yale University in Connecticut. After that, demand from the United States grew, so Bruker opened an office in Elmsford, New York which marked the start of their US activities.[5] In 2008 after a corporate reorganization lasting 8 years, all divisions were merged in a unified Bruker Corporation.[5]
Günther Laukien died in 1997, his son Frank D. Laukien, is currently the CEO of Bruker.[8] His son Jörg C. Laukien, also works for the company.[9] His son Dirk D. Laukien is a former company executive.[10]

Other[edit]
In 1964, the company bought the NMR division of the Swiss Trüb-Täuber.[4]
Bruker made several offers to take over its supplier Oxford Instruments during the 1970s, but after almost a decade of negotiations, an acquisition was eventually rejected by Oxford Instruments.[28]
In 1997, the analytical X-ray division of Siemens was acquired by Bruker.[29]
In 2010 Bruker bought 3 product lines from Agilent, which Agilent had acquired from Varian.[30] These included mass spectrometry and gas chromatography instruments. They have since divested these products to Scion Instruments with the exception of the triple quadrupole[citation needed]
In 2012 Bruker bought parts of Carestream Health, including their in-vivo imaging portfolio and related aspects.[31]

OUR CUSTOMERS


Prof. Dr. Auwärter“… Our co-development of the Toxtyper™ solution has provided us with ultrafast identification of drugsand toxins using LC-MSn, for our research and service needs.”

Dr. Ying Ge“... we showed that the extreme resolution capabilities with Bruker solariX XR™ are beyond what can be achieved by other instruments.”

Dr. Böttcher “We rely on Bruker’s robust LC-MS/MS solution, the Toxtyper™, to rapidly analyze biological samples for drugs and drugs of abuse, with unprecedented accuracy”.

Isabella Felli"While focusing on the subject of IDPs, I was impressed that all we know is largely driven by the technology we have."

Malte Drescher"The main feature of the EMXnano is that is it easy to use."

Patricia Beaune"With the NMR profiling, we are using only one method, in 20 minutes, where previously it took six days."

Bernard Siow"Dr. Siow estimated that with about 30 minutes training and a good protocol, a non-MRI expert can operate the ICON"

Prof. Jonathan Sweedler"For mass spectrometry imaging, Bruker´s Technology leads the way. In particular, their MALDI imaging instruments have incredible figures of merit that other vendors don´t come close to."

Imperial College London"The latest generation of Bruker NMR instruments gives us staggering day to day and long term reproducibility and reliability of spectral acquisition, coupled with the ability to do automated digital quantification of multiple metabolites."

Prof. Craig Rice"The most vital aspect for the successful study of metallo-supramolecular self-assemblies is the production of 3D crystal structures. The solid-state 3D structure is the definitive proof of the correctness of the structure, and the chemistry related to it."

Prof. Bohari M. Yamin"... our new D8 QUEST again pushes the limits still further and we get high quality data from smaller, weakly diffracting samples in shorter space of time."

Prof. Kannan KrishnanAdvances in the field of MPI: an interview with Professor Kannan Krishnan

Prof. Paul Roesch"The Aeon 1 GHz is a breakthrough for our studies of the interaction of transcription factors with bacterial RNA-polymerase. With a molecular mass exceeding 450 kDa, this is one of the largest heteromeric protein systems ever successfully studied by NMR."

Bruker Corporation is a manufacturer of scientific instruments for molecular and materials research, as well as for industrial and applied analysis. It is headquartered in Billerica, Massachusetts and is the publicly traded parent company of Bruker Scientific Instruments (Bruker AXS, Bruker BioSpin, Bruker Daltonics and Bruker Optics) and Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies (BEST) divisions.
In April 2010, Bruker created a Chemical Analysis Division (headquartered in Fremont, CA) under the Bruker Daltonics subsidiary. This division contains three former Varian product lines: ICPMS systems, laboratory gas chromatography (GC), and GC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (originally designed by Bear Instruments and acquired by Varian in 2001).
In 2012 it sponsored the Fritz Feigl Prize,[3] and since 1999 the company has also sponsored the Günther Laukien Prize.[4]

History[edit]
The company was founded on September 7, 1960, in Karlsruhe, Germany[5] as Bruker-Physik AG[4] by five people, one of them being Günther Laukien, who was a professor at the University of Karlsruhe at the time. The name Bruker originates from co-founder Emil Bruker, as Günther Laukien himself was formally not allowed to commercialize his research whilst being a professor.[5] Bruker produced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) and EMR spectroscopy equipment then. In the early 1960s, the company had around 60 employees and was growing rapidly.[6] One of the early success products was the HFX 90 NMR spectroscopy system, with three independent channels and which was also the first NRM system using only semiconductor transistors.[7] In 1969, Bruker launched the first commercial Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy system (FT-NMR) and in the 1970s the company was the first to commercialize a superconducting FT-NMR. Later, the company would expand their product range with MRI, FTIR and FT-Raman spectrometers and with mass spectrometers.[8]
In 1968, Bruker shipped NMR systems to Yale University in Connecticut. After that, demand from the United States grew, so Bruker opened an office in Elmsford, New York which marked the start of their US activities.[5] In 2008 after a corporate reorganization lasting 8 years, all divisions were merged in a unified Bruker Corporation.[5]
Günther Laukien died in 1997, his son Frank D. Laukien, is currently the CEO of Bruker.[8] His son Jörg C. Laukien, also works for the company.[9] His son Dirk D. Laukien is a former company executive.[10]

Other[edit]
In 1964, the company bought the NMR division of the Swiss Trüb-Täuber.[4]
Bruker made several offers to take over its supplier Oxford Instruments during the 1970s, but after almost a decade of negotiations, an acquisition was eventually rejected by Oxford Instruments.[28]
In 1997, the analytical X-ray division of Siemens was acquired by Bruker.[29]
In 2010 Bruker bought 3 product lines from Agilent, which Agilent had acquired from Varian.[30] These included mass spectrometry and gas chromatography instruments. They have since divested these products to Scion Instruments with the exception of the triple quadrupole[citation needed]
In 2012 Bruker bought parts of Carestream Health, including their in-vivo imaging portfolio and related aspects.[31]

The company was founded on September 7, 1960, in Karlsruhe, Germany[5] as Bruker-Physik AG[4] by five people, one of them being Günther Laukien, who was a professor at the University of Karlsruhe at the time. The name Bruker originates from co-founder Emil Bruker, as Günther Laukien himself was formally not allowed to commercialize his research whilst being a professor.[5] Bruker produced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) and EMR spectroscopy equipment then.

Bruker made several offers to take over its supplier Oxford Instruments during the 1970s, but after almost a decade of negotiations, an acquisition was eventually rejected by Oxford Instruments.[28]
In 1997, the analytical X-ray division of Siemens was acquired by Bruker.[29]
In 2010 Bruker bought 3 product lines from Agilent, which Agilent had acquired from Varian.[30] These included mass spectrometry and gas chromatography instruments. They have since divested these products to Scion Instruments with the exception of the triple quadrupole[citation needed]
In 2012 Bruker bought parts of Carestream Health, including their in-vivo imaging portfolio and related aspects.[31]

Bruker Corporation is a manufacturer of scientific instruments for molecular and materials research, as well as for industrial and applied analysis. It is headquartered in Billerica, Massachusetts and is the publicly traded parent company of Bruker Scientific Instruments (Bruker AXS, Bruker BioSpin, Bruker Daltonics and Bruker Optics) and Bruker Energy & Supercon Technologies (BEST) divisions.
In April 2010, Bruker created a Chemical Analysis Division (headquartered in Fremont, CA) under the Bruker Daltonics subsidiary. This division contains three former Varian product lines: ICPMS systems, laboratory gas chromatography (GC), and GC-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (originally designed by Bear Instruments and acquired by Varian in 2001).
In 2012 it sponsored the Fritz Feigl Prize,[3] and since 1999 the company has also sponsored the Günther Laukien Prize.[4]

History[edit]
The company was founded on September 7, 1960, in Karlsruhe, Germany[5] as Bruker-Physik AG[4] by five people, one of them being Günther Laukien, who was a professor at the University of Karlsruhe at the time. The name Bruker originates from co-founder Emil Bruker, as Günther Laukien himself was formally not allowed to commercialize his research whilst being a professor.[5] Bruker produced Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) and EMR spectroscopy equipment then. In the early 1960s, the company had around 60 employees and was growing rapidly.[6] One of the early success products was the HFX 90 NMR spectroscopy system, with three independent channels and which was also the first NRM system using only semiconductor transistors.[7] In 1969, Bruker launched the first commercial Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy system (FT-NMR) and in the 1970s the company was the first to commercialize a superconducting FT-NMR. Later, the company would expand their product range with MRI, FTIR and FT-Raman spectrometers and with mass spectrometers.[8]
In 1968, Bruker shipped NMR systems to Yale University in Connecticut. After that, demand from the United States grew, so Bruker opened an office in Elmsford, New York which marked the start of their US activities.[5] In 2008 after a corporate reorganization lasting 8 years, all divisions were merged in a unified Bruker Corporation.[5]
Günther Laukien died in 1997, his son Frank D. Laukien, is currently the CEO of Bruker.[8] His son Jörg C. Laukien, also works for the company.[9] His son Dirk D. Laukien is a former company executive.[10]

Other[edit]
In 1964, the company bought the NMR division of the Swiss Trüb-Täuber.[4]
Bruker made several offers to take over its supplier Oxford Instruments during the 1970s, but after almost a decade of negotiations, an acquisition was eventually rejected by Oxford Instruments.[28]
In 1997, the analytical X-ray division of Siemens was acquired by Bruker.[29]
In 2010 Bruker bought 3 product lines from Agilent, which Agilent had acquired from Varian.[30] These included mass spectrometry and gas chromatography instruments. They have since divested these products to Scion Instruments with the exception of the triple quadrupole[citation needed]
In 2012 Bruker bought parts of Carestream Health, including their in-vivo imaging portfolio and related aspects.[31]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
