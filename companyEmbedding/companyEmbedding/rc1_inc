Vortech Adapter Nuts
These steel prop adapter nuts include prop washers and are also CNC machined to offer the best possible quality. They are available in different crankshaft threads to fit many engines on the market.
To avoid the problem of long screws, which tend to flex and break at the point where they enter the adapter nut, we make 4 lengths of adapter nuts: Short, Long, X-Long and XX- Long. This allows for the use of shorter screws, which dont flex and break. 
The 4x 0.7mm, 5x0.8mm, and 8-32 adapters are different in form than the rest of the adapter nuts. They have a stud on the end of a 5/16 hex rod, which is tapped 10-32 on the other end for the spinner screw. They are, also, shorter than the rest of the adapter nuts, to accomodate the shaft length, or the bolt head thickness, in order to make the length (Long, Xlong, XXlong) the same for a particular spinner size. These adapters screw into the end of the crankshaft, or into the head of the prop bolt.

Although it will depend on the thickness of your prop and the spinner size, as a general rule, always use the longest adapter nut possible.
Use SHORT adapters with spinners 2 1/2 and under.
Use LONG adapters with 2 3/4 to 3 spinners.
Use X-LONG adapters with 3 1/4 to 4" spinners.
Use XX-LONG adapters with spinners 4 1/2" and up.
Use a LOCK NUT with an adapter nut on 4-stroke engines.

								Vortech Spinners (FAI)




Are you tired of having to pay through the nose for a top quality aluminum spinners? We are too and we have done something about it. Vortech spinners are manufactured by Dave Brown Products - right in our own factory.

Vortech spinners are spun from Aluminum sheet - not molded/cast from brittle material, or machined out of expensive bar stock!
Precision CNC machined to exacting tolerances.
Designed to be strong, yet light weight.
Spinner cone locks into backplate to stop spinner cone expansion.
Backplate is knurled for positive grip between engines drive washer and your propeller.
All Vortech Spinners start life the same way - as a flat piece of aluminum sheet which has a CNC machined tip pressed into the center.
This disk is then, spin-formed to shape and turned to high precision.
After the cone is machined, it is polished to a beautiful reflective finish.
Vortech spinners have cutouts with clearance for popular sizes of props.

The FAI shape has a shorter profile than our other spinners - perfect for most of the precision-aerobatic designs available today.





Using a unique CNC manufacturing process insures that every Vortech spinner is precision spun, machined, light-weight, and polished to a brilliant shine.
