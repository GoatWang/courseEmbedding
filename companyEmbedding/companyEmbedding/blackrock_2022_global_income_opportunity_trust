      exchange rates or financial and capital markets, which could result in

      Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and regulatory, supervisory or 
      enforcement actions of government agencies relating to the Fund or 
      BlackRock, as applicable; (8) terrorist activities, international 
      hostilities and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the 
      general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets, 
      specific industries or BlackRock; (9) BlackRock’s ability to attract and 
      retain highly talented professionals; (10) the impact of BlackRock 
      electing to provide support to its products from time to time; and (11)

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release, and other statements that BlackRock or the Fund may
      make, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to the Fund or
      BlackRock’s future financial or business performance, strategies or
      expectations. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by
      words or phrases such as “trend,” “potential,” “opportunity,”
      “pipeline,” “believe,” “comfortable,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “current,”
      “intention,” “estimate,” “position,” “assume,” “outlook,” “continue,”
      “remain,” “maintain,” “sustain,” “seek,” “achieve,” and similar
      expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,”
      “should,” “could,” “may” or similar expressions.
    

      BlackRock cautions that forward-looking statements are subject to
      numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time.
      Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and
      BlackRock assumes no duty to and does not undertake to update
      forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from
      those anticipated in forward-looking statements and future results could
      differ materially from historical performance.
    

      With respect to the Fund, the following factors, among others, could
      cause actual events to differ materially from forward-looking statements
      or historical performance: (1) changes and volatility in political,
      economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment, foreign
      exchange rates or financial and capital markets, which could result in
      changes in demand for the Fund or in the Fund’s net asset value; (2) the
      relative and absolute investment performance of the Fund and its
      investments; (3) the impact of increased competition; (4) the
      unfavorable resolution of any legal proceedings; (5) the extent and
      timing of any distributions or share repurchases; (6) the impact, extent
      and timing of technological changes; (7) the impact of legislative and
      regulatory actions and reforms, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
      Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and regulatory, supervisory or
      enforcement actions of government agencies relating to the Fund or
      BlackRock, as applicable; (8) terrorist activities, international
      hostilities and natural disasters, which may adversely affect the
      general economy, domestic and local financial and capital markets,
      specific industries or BlackRock; (9) BlackRock’s ability to attract and
      retain highly talented professionals; (10) the impact of BlackRock
      electing to provide support to its products from time to time; and (11)
      the impact of problems at other financial institutions or the failure or
      negative performance of products at other financial institutions.
    

      Annual and Semi-Annual Reports and other regulatory filings of the Fund
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are accessible on
      the SEC's website at www.sec.gov
and on BlackRock’s website at www.blackrock.com,
      and may discuss these or other factors that affect the Fund. The
      information contained on BlackRock’s website is not a part of this press
      release.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.54      Net Money Flow ()  47,112    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey. 

Got it >



Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in 
            retirement and how much income
            you'll need each year.

There are two steps you can take to help
            make sure your money lasts.

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years
            is pretty hard. 
            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in

How did we calculate this?
 To calculate how many years it might take to spend your guessed amount 
              in retirement, we used your age, years until retirement, and inflation rate 
              of 3%, and average spending data from the 2012 Expenditure Survey.

Based on national spending averages,
$1,500,000 will likely be spent by the age of 76.
How did we calculate this?
 Come up a little short? Guessing how much money you might
            need 
            to save for retirement that could last 30 or 40 years

            A good place to start: Think about how
            many years you may live in
