Belden's Strategic Priorities


Belden's strategic priorities are centered on three broad principles designed to create shareholder value: strength, growth, and expansion. The foundation of Belden's strategy is managing the product portfolio to increase revenue in higher margin and strategically important products; protecting and enhancing Belden brands; recruiting and developing top talent; continuously improving business processes through lean management; and migrating manufacturing to a coherent global footprint to reduce product landed cost. To grow the business, Belden is pursuing organic and inorganic opportunities in fast-growing regions. Additionally, through its Market Delivery System, it identifies attractive markets; improves channel and end customer relationships, and creates awareness for Belden products. To expand the business, Belden has transformed itself from a cable company to a signal transmission solutions provider with a complete product portfolio including connectivity, networking and cybersecurity.
