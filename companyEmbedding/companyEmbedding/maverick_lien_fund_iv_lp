Maverick Real Estate Partners Completes Closing on Maverick Lien Fund 
      III LP with $25.9 Million Committed






April 02, 2015 04:52 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Maverick 
      Real Estate Partners LLC (“Maverick”), a distressed debt 
      private equity firm, announced the closing for Maverick Lien Fund III LP 
      (“Lien Fund III”) with $25.9 million in commitments.
    


      This discretionary fund will make investments ranging from $500,000 - 
      $5,000,000 in loans, mechanics liens, and judgments secured by property 
      located in NY, NJ, CT, and PA. “By making smaller investments in deals 
      generated from our rigorous research process, Maverick finds 
      non-competitive investment opportunities that are under the 
      institutional radar. This allows Maverick to buy right, providing 
      flexibility in business plan execution,” said Ted Martell, Principal and 
      Director of Asset Management for Maverick.
    

      Lien Fund III raised a total of $25.9 million from a diverse group of 
      investors, including family offices, foundations, wealth managers, and 
      high net worth individuals. “We are very pleased to have a highly 
      diversified group of both new and long-standing investors, and view 
      their enthusiasm as a strong endorsement for our contrarian investment 
      approach,” said David Aviram, Principal and Director of Acquisitions for 
      Maverick.
