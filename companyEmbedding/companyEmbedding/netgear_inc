Product range[edit]




The AC1900 dual band, wireless router.


Netgear's range of products are primarily focused in the networking market, with networking products for home and business use, including wired and wireless technology.
ProSAFE switches[edit]
Netgear markets a range of network products for the business sector, most notably their ProSAFE switch range. As of May 2007[update], Netgear provides limited lifetime warranties across their entire range of ProSAFE products for as long as the original buyer owns the product. Currently focusing on Multimedia segment.[2]
Network appliances[edit]




Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Firewall FVS336G


Netgear also markets various network appliances for the business sector, such as managed switches and wired and wireless VPN firewalls. The firewalls compete in the SoHo and SMB market with Linksys, as well as with software distributions such as IPFire, pfSense, m0n0wall, SmoothWall, and Untangle. The managed switches compete with HP ProCurve Networking and 3Com.
Network-attached storage[edit]
Netgear sells a line of premium NAS devices to small businesses and consumers under the product name ReadyNAS. With this storage hardware line, Netgear vies with competitors like Buffalo and HP to deliver NAS solutions to target market segments. Netgear entered the storage market in May 2007 when it acquired Infrant (originator of the ReadyNAS line).[3][4] In March 2009, Netgear began to offer an integrated online backup solution called the ReadyNAS Vault.[5]
Security concerns[edit]
Various Netgear products that were manufactured by SerComm were found to contain a backdoor that allowed unauthorized remote access to the affected devices.[6] Netgear, along with other companies with products manufactured by SerComm that were affected by the aforementioned backdoor issued firmware updates for some of the affected products, but it was shortly found that the updates merely hid the backdoor but did not remove it.[7]
On January, 2017, various Netgear products were found to be vulnerable to an exploit that allows a third party to access the router and the internal network and turn the router into a botnet.[8]

Product range[edit]




The AC1900 dual band, wireless router.


Netgear's range of products are primarily focused in the networking market, with networking products for home and business use, including wired and wireless technology.
ProSAFE switches[edit]
Netgear markets a range of network products for the business sector, most notably their ProSAFE switch range. As of May 2007[update], Netgear provides limited lifetime warranties across their entire range of ProSAFE products for as long as the original buyer owns the product. Currently focusing on Multimedia segment.[2]
Network appliances[edit]




Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Firewall FVS336G


Netgear also markets various network appliances for the business sector, such as managed switches and wired and wireless VPN firewalls. The firewalls compete in the SoHo and SMB market with Linksys, as well as with software distributions such as IPFire, pfSense, m0n0wall, SmoothWall, and Untangle. The managed switches compete with HP ProCurve Networking and 3Com.
Network-attached storage[edit]
Netgear sells a line of premium NAS devices to small businesses and consumers under the product name ReadyNAS. With this storage hardware line, Netgear vies with competitors like Buffalo and HP to deliver NAS solutions to target market segments. Netgear entered the storage market in May 2007 when it acquired Infrant (originator of the ReadyNAS line).[3][4] In March 2009, Netgear began to offer an integrated online backup solution called the ReadyNAS Vault.[5]
Security concerns[edit]
Various Netgear products that were manufactured by SerComm were found to contain a backdoor that allowed unauthorized remote access to the affected devices.[6] Netgear, along with other companies with products manufactured by SerComm that were affected by the aforementioned backdoor issued firmware updates for some of the affected products, but it was shortly found that the updates merely hid the backdoor but did not remove it.[7]
On January, 2017, various Netgear products were found to be vulnerable to an exploit that allows a third party to access the router and the internal network and turn the router into a botnet.[8]

Product range[edit]




The AC1900 dual band, wireless router.


Netgear's range of products are primarily focused in the networking market, with networking products for home and business use, including wired and wireless technology.
ProSAFE switches[edit]
Netgear markets a range of network products for the business sector, most notably their ProSAFE switch range. As of May 2007[update], Netgear provides limited lifetime warranties across their entire range of ProSAFE products for as long as the original buyer owns the product. Currently focusing on Multimedia segment.[2]
Network appliances[edit]




Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Firewall FVS336G


Netgear also markets various network appliances for the business sector, such as managed switches and wired and wireless VPN firewalls. The firewalls compete in the SoHo and SMB market with Linksys, as well as with software distributions such as IPFire, pfSense, m0n0wall, SmoothWall, and Untangle. The managed switches compete with HP ProCurve Networking and 3Com.
Network-attached storage[edit]
Netgear sells a line of premium NAS devices to small businesses and consumers under the product name ReadyNAS. With this storage hardware line, Netgear vies with competitors like Buffalo and HP to deliver NAS solutions to target market segments. Netgear entered the storage market in May 2007 when it acquired Infrant (originator of the ReadyNAS line).[3][4] In March 2009, Netgear began to offer an integrated online backup solution called the ReadyNAS Vault.[5]
Security concerns[edit]
Various Netgear products that were manufactured by SerComm were found to contain a backdoor that allowed unauthorized remote access to the affected devices.[6] Netgear, along with other companies with products manufactured by SerComm that were affected by the aforementioned backdoor issued firmware updates for some of the affected products, but it was shortly found that the updates merely hid the backdoor but did not remove it.[7]
On January, 2017, various Netgear products were found to be vulnerable to an exploit that allows a third party to access the router and the internal network and turn the router into a botnet.[8]

Product range[edit]




The AC1900 dual band, wireless router.


Netgear's range of products are primarily focused in the networking market, with networking products for home and business use, including wired and wireless technology.
ProSAFE switches[edit]
Netgear markets a range of network products for the business sector, most notably their ProSAFE switch range. As of May 2007[update], Netgear provides limited lifetime warranties across their entire range of ProSAFE products for as long as the original buyer owns the product. Currently focusing on Multimedia segment.[2]
Network appliances[edit]




Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Firewall FVS336G


Netgear also markets various network appliances for the business sector, such as managed switches and wired and wireless VPN firewalls. The firewalls compete in the SoHo and SMB market with Linksys, as well as with software distributions such as IPFire, pfSense, m0n0wall, SmoothWall, and Untangle. The managed switches compete with HP ProCurve Networking and 3Com.
Network-attached storage[edit]
Netgear sells a line of premium NAS devices to small businesses and consumers under the product name ReadyNAS. With this storage hardware line, Netgear vies with competitors like Buffalo and HP to deliver NAS solutions to target market segments. Netgear entered the storage market in May 2007 when it acquired Infrant (originator of the ReadyNAS line).[3][4] In March 2009, Netgear began to offer an integrated online backup solution called the ReadyNAS Vault.[5]
Security concerns[edit]
Various Netgear products that were manufactured by SerComm were found to contain a backdoor that allowed unauthorized remote access to the affected devices.[6] Netgear, along with other companies with products manufactured by SerComm that were affected by the aforementioned backdoor issued firmware updates for some of the affected products, but it was shortly found that the updates merely hid the backdoor but did not remove it.[7]
On January, 2017, various Netgear products were found to be vulnerable to an exploit that allows a third party to access the router and the internal network and turn the router into a botnet.[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
