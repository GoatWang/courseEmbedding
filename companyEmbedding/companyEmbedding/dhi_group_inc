DHI Group, Inc. Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results






Jul 27, 2017, 7:00am EDT














NEW YORK, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --

Second quarter 2017 total revenues of $52.4 million, net income of $1.8 million and diluted EPS of $0.04
Cash flow from operations of $9.2 million; Adjusted EBITDA of $9.5 million, which was impacted by $1.1 million of disposition related and other costs
Commenced process of divesting non-tech businesses to streamline the operating portfolio
DHI Group, Inc. (NYSE: DHX) ("DHI" or the "Company"), a leading online career resource and talent acquisition platform for technology professionals and other select professional communities, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
"Our business performed in line with our expectations in the second quarter as we transitioned to a new organization structure that will enable us to operate as a more focused, flexible, and agile company to execute our tech-focused strategy," said Michael Durney, President and Chief Executive Officer of DHI Group, Inc. "In addition, we made progress on our product initiatives to deepen engagement with professionals and address customer pain points. The positive impact we've seen so far strengthens our conviction in the plan and our ability to change the arc of growth and profitability for the Company, and ultimately enhance shareholder value."
Q2 2017 Tech-Focused Product and Business Highlights

Launched new marketing initiatives for Dice with the "Hack Your Career" campaign to increase engagement with tech professionals, and partnerships with Bustle, a digital media company serving millennial women, and Spiceworks, a tech networking community
"Open Web First" go-to-market strategy that leads with social sourcing drove 103% year-over-year growth in Open Web customers, increasing penetration of Dice recruitment package customers to 34% as of June 30, 2017, up from 30% as of March 31, 2017 and from 16% a year ago

Q2 and Year-to-Date 2017 Financial Highlights
"The market dynamics for our business remained challenging to our renewal and new business efforts. While we're not content with these results, they are consistent with the 2017 outlook we provided in May," said Luc Grégoire, Chief Financial Officer. "However, we advanced our strategy to return the business to growth with the current process to divest our non-tech businesses, redeploying resources in a more effective and cost efficient manner, and increasing the focus on key drivers and levers of our technology talent solutions business. Looking forward, we are optimistic that the steps we have taken will begin to stabilize our business."

(1) The YTD increase in deferred revenue primarily reflects an increase in the Tech & Clearance and Global Industry Group segments of $0.9 million each.

 
Business Outlook
The Company expects its year-over-year rate of decline in revenue to abate progressively in the second half of 2017, while spending should increase only modestly as increased investment in its core tech business will be mostly offset by efficiencies from realigning and simplifying the organization. This outlook does not consider the impact of potential divestitures, as there is no assurance as to their timing or execution. On today's conference call, management will discuss additional details of its tech-focused strategy, including context around the financial impact of the Company's 2017 strategic objectives and operational plans.
Conference Call Information
The Company will host a conference call accompanied by a presentation of supporting materials today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results, recent developments, and progress on its tech-focused strategy. Speaking on the call will be Michael Durney, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Luc Grégoire, Chief Financial Officer.

The Company has provided certain non-GAAP financial information as additional information for its operating results.  These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures reported by other companies.  The Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock based compensation expense, other non-recurring income or expense ("Adjusted EBITDA") and Adjusted EBITDA margin provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company's management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company and for budgeting and planning purposes.  The non-GAAP measures apply to consolidated results and results by segment or other measure as shown within this document.  The Company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures elsewhere in the document.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP metrics used by management to measure operating performance.  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for internal monitoring and planning, including preparation of annual budgets, analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors.  The Company also uses this measure to calculate amounts of performance based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program.  Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement, represents net income plus (to the extent deducted in calculating such net income) interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock option expenses, losses resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business, certain writeoffs in connection with indebtedness, impairment charges with respect to long-lived assets, expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering, extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash expenses or losses, transaction costs in connection with the Credit Agreement up to $250,000, deferred revenues written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, writeoff of non-cash stock compensation expense, and business interruption insurance proceeds, minus (to the extent included in calculating such net income) non-cash income or gains, interest income, and any income or gain resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business.
We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides our board of directors, management and investors with additional information to measure our performance, provide comparisons from period to period and company to company by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense) and tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), and to estimate our value.
We also present Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our Credit Agreement contain ratios based on this measure.  Our Credit Agreement is material to us because it is one of our primary sources of liquidity.  If our Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our Credit Agreement that are based on Adjusted EBITDA may be violated and could cause a default and acceleration of payment obligations under our Credit Agreement.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is computed as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability.
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and oral statements made from time to time by our representatives contain forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on those statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include information without limitation concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategy. These statements often include words such as "may," "will," "should," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate" or similar expressions.  These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute our tech-focused strategy, the review of potential dispositions of certain of our businesses and the terms and timing of any such transactions, competition from existing and future competitors in the highly competitive market in which we operate, failure to adapt our business model to keep pace with rapid changes in the recruiting and career services business, failure to maintain and develop our reputation and brand recognition, failure to increase or maintain the number of customers who purchase recruitment packages, cyclicality or downturns in the economy or industries we serve, the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's future departure from the European Union, including uncertainty in respect of the regulation of data protection and data privacy, failure to attract qualified professionals to our websites or grow the number of qualified professionals who use our websites, failure to successfully identify or integrate acquisitions, U.S. and foreign government regulation of the Internet and taxation, our ability to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility or refinance our indebtedness and restrictions on our current and future operations under such indebtedness.  These factors and others are discussed in more detail in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available on the Investors page of our website at www.dhigroupinc.com, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, under the headings "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made by the Company or its representatives herein, or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which it is made. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible to predict these events or how they may affect us. We have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof, except as required by applicable law.

Strategic DevelopmentsEarlier this year, the Company engaged in a comprehensive business strategy review that culminated in a renewed focus on providing more value within the tech vertical, which is designed to reinvigorate its technology talent acquisition franchise and fast-track development of next-generation talent acquisition solutions. This strategy, which includes launching new products and services targeting the tech talent recruitment and sourcing market, enhances exposure to the favorable fundamentals of the tech employment vertical to drive improved growth opportunities and shareholder value.In light of announced and pending transactions in the human capital management industry, the board of directors has also expressed support for the Company to engage an investment bank to explore strategic alternatives to ensure the Company's ownership structure optimizes the Company's ability to achieve its growth agenda and maximize shareholder value. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in a transaction."Tech is a large and growing global employment vertical that offers our business significant long term growth opportunities, as today most companies need tech talent to succeed," said Mr. Durney. "We are excited about our strategy to place a stronger focus on tech talent solutions and believe it will serve our shareholders' best interests regardless of prospects for a new ownership structure."Executive Management UpdateThe Company announced the appointment of its new Chief Financial Officer, Luc Grégoire, who joined the Company today. Mr. Grégoire comes to the Company from Avepoint, Inc., where he was Chief Financial Officer, and prior to that held senior finance roles with Take-Two Interactive and McGraw Hill, among others, and brings significant experience managing the financial organization for developing and growing SaaS businesses.Stock Repurchase ProgramDuring the third quarter of 2016, the Company purchased approximately 0.4 million shares of its common stock at an average cost of $6.70 per share for a total cost of approximately $2.7 million.  At September 30, 2016, approximately $22.3 million remained authorized for repurchase under a $50 million plan that expires in December 2016.Business Outlook  Current Q4 2016 and Full-Year 2016 Business Outlook     ($ in millions, except diluted earnings per share)   Q4 2016   FY 2016          Revenues   $54.0 - $55.0   $225.3 - $226.3          Talent acquisition brands Adjusted EBITDA (1)   $18.5 - $19.0   $79.1 - $79.6     Corporate expenses   $3.1 - $3.3   $13.7 - $13.9     Talent acquisition brands Adjusted EBITDA less corporate expenses (1)   $15.4 - $15.8   $65.4 - $65.8          Brightmatter Group Adjusted EBITDA   ($2.0) - ($1.9)   ($7.2) - ($7.1)     Total Adjusted EBITDA   $13.4 - $13.8   $58.2 - $58.6          Depreciation and amortization   $2.9 - $3.0   $16.6 - $16.7     Non-cash stock compensation expense   $2.4 - $2.5   $10.2 - $10.3     Interest expense, net   $0.7 - $0.8   $3.3 - $3.4     Income tax rate (2)   36% - 37%   150% - 160%          Net income   $4.6 - $4.8   ($2.2) - ($2.0)     Net income, excluding impairment charge   $4.6 - $4.8   $19.5 - $19.8          Diluted earnings per share   $0.09 - $0.10   ($0.05) - ($0.04)     Diluted earnings per share, excluding impairment charge   $0.09 - $0.10   $0.40 - $0.41     Diluted share count   49 million   49 million          Estimated yearly change in revenue by segment (in US dollars):     Tech & Clearance   (9%) - (8%)   (4.0%) - (3.5%)     Global Industry Group:       eFinancialCareers   (13%) - (11%)   (4%) - (3%)     Rigzone   (57%) - (55%)   (56.0%) - (55.5%)     Hcareers   (7%) - (2%)   (6%) - (5%)     BioSpace   (14%) - (13%)   (14.5%) - (14.0%)     Healthcare   (1%) - 1%   4% - 5%       (1) Talent acquisition brands includes the Company's Tech & Clearance, Global Industry Group, and Healthcare segments (2) Full-year income tax rate is a consequence of the $24.6 million impairment charge with its $2.8 million related tax benefit.

In addition, the Company's management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company and for budgeting and planning purposes.  The Company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures in the section entitled "Supplemental Information and Non-GAAP Reconciliations."Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP metric used by management to measure operating performance.  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for internal monitoring and planning, including preparation of annual budgets, analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors.  The Company also uses this measure to calculate amounts of performance based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program.  Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement, represents net income plus (to the extent deducted in calculating such net income) interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock option expenses, losses resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business, certain writeoffs in connection with indebtedness, impairment charges with respect to long-lived assets, expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering, extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash expenses or losses, transaction costs in connection with the Credit Agreement up to $250,000, deferred revenues written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, writeoff of non-cash stock compensation expense, and business interruption insurance proceeds, minus (to the extent included in calculating such net income) non-cash income or gains, interest income, and any income or gain resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business.We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides our board of directors, management and investors with additional information to measure our performance, provide comparisons from period to period and company to company by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense) and tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), and to estimate our value.We also present Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our Credit Agreement contain ratios based on this measure.  Our Credit Agreement is material to us because it is one of our primary sources of liquidity.  If our Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our Credit Agreement that are based on Adjusted EBITDA may be violated and could cause a default and acceleration of payment obligations under our Credit Agreement.Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability.Adjusted EBITDA Excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costsAdjusted EBITDA excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs is a non-GAAP metric used by management to measure operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs as a measure of our financial performance given our sale of Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs. Adjusted EBITDA excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs, represents Adjusted EBITDA defined above, less Slashdot Media EBITDA and disposition related and other costs.Revenues Excluding Slashdot MediaRevenues excluding Slashdot Media is a non-GAAP metric used by management to measure operating performance.  Revenues excluding Slashdot Media represents Revenues as defined above less Slashdot Media revenue.  We consider Revenues excluding Slashdot Media to be an important measure to evaluate our financial performance given our sale of Slashdot Media.Net Income Excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costsNet Income excluding Slashdot Media is a non-GAAP metric used by management to measure operating performance. Net Income excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs is defined as Net Income less Slashdot Media Net Income (Loss) and disposition related and other costs. We consider Net Income excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs to be an important measure of our financial performance given our sale of Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs.Net Income Excluding Impairment ChargeNet Income excluding impairment charge is a non-GAAP metric used by management to measure operating performance. Net Income excluding impairment charge is defined as Net Income less impairment charge, net of income taxes. We consider Net Income excluding impairment charge to be an important measure of our financial performance, as it better reflects the ongoing operations of the Company.Diluted Earnings per Share Excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costsDiluted earnings per share excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs is a non-GAAP metric used by management to measure operating performance. Diluted earnings per share excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs is defined as diluted earnings per share less impact per share of Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs. We consider diluted earnings per share excluding Slashdot Media and disposition related and other costs to be an important measure of our financial performance.Diluted Earnings per Share Excluding Impairment ChargeDiluted earnings per share excluding impairment charge is a non-GAAP metric used by management to measure operating performance. Diluted earnings per share excluding impairment charge is defined as diluted earnings (loss) per share less impact per share of impairment charge. We consider diluted earnings per share excluding impairment charge to be an important measure of our financial performance, as it better reflects the ongoing operations of the Company.Free Cash FlowWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow is an important non-GAAP measure as it provides useful cash flow information regarding our ability to service, incur or pay down indebtedness or repurchase our common stock.  We use free cash flow as a measure to reflect cash available to service our debt as well as to fund our expenditures.  A limitation of using free cash flow versus the GAAP measure of net cash provided by operating activities is that free cash flow does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance from operations for the period since it includes cash used for capital expenditures during the period and is adjusted for acquisition related payments within operating cash flows.Net DebtNet Debt is defined as total principal outstanding less cash. We consider Net Debt to be an important measure of liquidity and indicator of our ability to meet ongoing obligations.  We also use Net Debt, among other measures, in evaluating our choices for capital deployment.  Net Debt presented herein is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release and oral statements made from time to time by our representatives contain forward-looking statements.

While we're not content with these results, they are consistent with the 2017 outlook we provided in May," said Luc Grégoire, Chief Financial Officer. "However, we advanced our strategy to return the business to growth with the current process to divest our non-tech businesses, redeploying resources in a more effective and cost efficient manner, and increasing the focus on key drivers and levers of our technology talent solutions business. Looking forward, we are optimistic that the steps we have taken will begin to stabilize our business."The following summarizes consolidated financial results for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:   ($ in millions, except per share data)          Q2 2017    Q2 2016    Change      Revenues    $   52.4     $   57.7     (9)%       Net income (1)(2)    $   1.8     $   4.9     (63)%       Diluted earnings per share (3)    $   0.04     $   0.10     (60)%                 Adjusted EBITDA (4) (5)    $   9.5     $   16.0     (41)%       Adjusted EBITDA margin     18.2   %     27.7   %                  (1) Includes the impact of disposition related and others costs, net of tax, of $0.7 million and $0.1 million for Q2 2017 and 2016, respectively.   (2) Net income in Q2 2017 was reduced by $0.2 million due to additional income tax expense related to the adoption of a new accounting standard, ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. No material difference to Q2 2016, had the new standard been applied to that period.   (3) Disposition related and other costs reduced diluted earnings per share in Q2 2017 by $0.01 with no material change to Q2 2016.   (4) Q2 2017 includes the impact of disposition related and other costs of $1.1 million.   (5) Reconciliations of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA and of Operating Cash Flows to Adjusted EBITDA are included toward the end of this press release.             The following summarizes Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin results for the quarter and year-to-date periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 ($ in millions).

This outlook does not consider the impact of potential divestitures, as there is no assurance as to their timing or execution. On today's conference call, management will discuss additional details of its tech-focused strategy, including context around the financial impact of the Company's 2017 strategic objectives and operational plans.Conference Call InformationThe Company will host a conference call accompanied by a presentation of supporting materials today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results, recent developments, and progress on its tech-focused strategy.

In addition, the Company's management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company and for budgeting and planning purposes.  The non-GAAP measures apply to consolidated results and results by segment or other measure as shown within this document.  The Company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures elsewhere in the document.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP metrics used by management to measure operating performance.  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for internal monitoring and planning, including preparation of annual budgets, analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors.  The Company also uses this measure to calculate amounts of performance based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program.  Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement, represents net income plus (to the extent deducted in calculating such net income) interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock option expenses, losses resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business, certain writeoffs in connection with indebtedness, impairment charges with respect to long-lived assets, expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering, extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash expenses or losses, transaction costs in connection with the Credit Agreement up to $250,000, deferred revenues written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, writeoff of non-cash stock compensation expense, and business interruption insurance proceeds, minus (to the extent included in calculating such net income) non-cash income or gains, interest income, and any income or gain resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business.We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides our board of directors, management and investors with additional information to measure our performance, provide comparisons from period to period and company to company by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense) and tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), and to estimate our value.We also present Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our Credit Agreement contain ratios based on this measure.  Our Credit Agreement is material to us because it is one of our primary sources of liquidity.  If our Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our Credit Agreement that are based on Adjusted EBITDA may be violated and could cause a default and acceleration of payment obligations under our Credit Agreement.Adjusted EBITDA Margin is computed as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release and oral statements made from time to time by our representatives contain forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on those statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include information without limitation concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategy. These statements often include words such as "may," "will," "should," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate" or similar expressions.  These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute our tech-focused strategy, the review of potential dispositions of certain of our businesses and the terms and timing of any such transactions, competition from existing and future competitors in the highly competitive market in which we operate, failure to adapt our business model to keep pace with rapid changes in the recruiting and career services business, failure to maintain and develop our reputation and brand recognition, failure to increase or maintain the number of customers who purchase recruitment packages, cyclicality or downturns in the economy or industries we serve, the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's future departure from the European Union, including uncertainty in respect of the regulation of data protection and data privacy, failure to attract qualified professionals to our websites or grow the number of qualified professionals who use our websites, failure to successfully identify or integrate acquisitions, U.S. and foreign government regulation of the Internet and taxation, our ability to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility or refinance our indebtedness and restrictions on our current and future operations under such indebtedness.  These factors and others are discussed in more detail in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available on the Investors page of our website at www.dhigroupinc.com, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, under the headings "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made by the Company or its representatives herein, or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which it is made. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible to predict these events or how they may affect us. We have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof, except as required by applicable law.

This outlook does not consider the impact of potential divestitures, as there is no assurance as to their timing or execution. On today's conference call, management will discuss additional details of its tech-focused strategy, including context around the financial impact of the Company's 2017 strategic objectives and operational plans.Conference Call InformationThe Company will host a conference call accompanied by a presentation of supporting materials today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results, recent developments, and progress on its tech-focused strategy.

In addition, the Company's management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company and for budgeting and planning purposes.  The non-GAAP measures apply to consolidated results and results by segment or other measure as shown within this document.  The Company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures elsewhere in the document.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP metrics used by management to measure operating performance.  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for internal monitoring and planning, including preparation of annual budgets, analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors.  The Company also uses this measure to calculate amounts of performance based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program.  Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement, represents net income plus (to the extent deducted in calculating such net income) interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock option expenses, losses resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business, certain writeoffs in connection with indebtedness, impairment charges with respect to long-lived assets, expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering, extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash expenses or losses, transaction costs in connection with the Credit Agreement up to $250,000, deferred revenues written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, writeoff of non-cash stock compensation expense, and business interruption insurance proceeds, minus (to the extent included in calculating such net income) non-cash income or gains, interest income, and any income or gain resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business.We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides our board of directors, management and investors with additional information to measure our performance, provide comparisons from period to period and company to company by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense) and tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), and to estimate our value.We also present Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our Credit Agreement contain ratios based on this measure.  Our Credit Agreement is material to us because it is one of our primary sources of liquidity.  If our Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our Credit Agreement that are based on Adjusted EBITDA may be violated and could cause a default and acceleration of payment obligations under our Credit Agreement.Adjusted EBITDA Margin is computed as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release and oral statements made from time to time by our representatives contain forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on those statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include information without limitation concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategy. These statements often include words such as "may," "will," "should," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate" or similar expressions.  These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute our tech-focused strategy, the review of potential dispositions of certain of our businesses and the terms and timing of any such transactions, competition from existing and future competitors in the highly competitive market in which we operate, failure to adapt our business model to keep pace with rapid changes in the recruiting and career services business, failure to maintain and develop our reputation and brand recognition, failure to increase or maintain the number of customers who purchase recruitment packages, cyclicality or downturns in the economy or industries we serve, the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's future departure from the European Union, including uncertainty in respect of the regulation of data protection and data privacy, failure to attract qualified professionals to our websites or grow the number of qualified professionals who use our websites, failure to successfully identify or integrate acquisitions, U.S. and foreign government regulation of the Internet and taxation, our ability to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility or refinance our indebtedness and restrictions on our current and future operations under such indebtedness.  These factors and others are discussed in more detail in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available on the Investors page of our website at www.dhigroupinc.com, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, under the headings "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

NEW YORK, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --

Second quarter 2017 total revenues of $52.4 million, net income of $1.8 million and diluted EPS of $0.04 
Cash flow from operations of $9.2 million; Adjusted EBITDA of $9.5 million, which was impacted by $1.1 million of disposition related and other costs 
Commenced process of divesting non-tech businesses to streamline the operating portfolio



DHI Group, Inc. (NYSE:    DHX) ("DHI" or the "Company"), a leading online career resource and talent acquisition platform for technology professionals and other select professional communities, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.
"Our business performed in line with our expectations in the second quarter as we transitioned to a new organization structure that will enable us to operate as a more focused, flexible, and agile company to execute our tech-focused strategy," said Michael Durney, President and Chief Executive Officer of DHI Group, Inc. "In addition, we made progress on our product initiatives to deepen engagement with professionals and address customer pain points. The positive impact we've seen so far strengthens our conviction in the plan and our ability to change the arc of growth and profitability for the Company, and ultimately enhance shareholder value."
Q2 2017 Tech-Focused Product and Business Highlights

Launched new marketing initiatives for Dice with the "Hack Your Career" campaign to increase engagement with tech professionals, and partnerships with Bustle, a digital media company serving millennial women, and Spiceworks, a tech networking community 
"Open Web First" go-to-market strategy that leads with social sourcing drove 103% year-over-year growth in Open Web customers, increasing penetration of Dice recruitment package customers to 34% as of June 30, 2017, up from 30% as of March 31, 2017 and from 16% a year ago 
Dice Careers app new downloads grew 28% year-over-year in the second quarter. As of June 30, 2017, cumulative downloads were 81% higher than June 30, 2016, which drove 52% growth in average monthly unique visitors 
Launched ClearanceJobs Voice, which adds live discussion between employers and candidates through the website

Q2 and Year-to-Date 2017 Financial Highlights
"The market dynamics for our business remained challenging to our renewal and new business efforts. While we're not content with these results, they are consistent with the 2017 outlook we provided in May," said Luc Grégoire, Chief Financial Officer. "However, we advanced our strategy to return the business to growth with the current process to divest our non-tech businesses, redeploying resources in a more effective and cost efficient manner, and increasing the focus on key drivers and levers of our technology talent solutions business. Looking forward, we are optimistic that the steps we have taken will begin to stabilize our business."
The following summarizes consolidated financial results for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016:

Business Outlook
The Company expects its year-over-year rate of decline in revenue to abate progressively in the second half of 2017, while spending should increase only modestly as increased investment in its core tech business will be mostly offset by efficiencies from realigning and simplifying the organization. This outlook does not consider the impact of potential divestitures, as there is no assurance as to their timing or execution. On today's conference call, management will discuss additional details of its tech-focused strategy, including context around the financial impact of the Company's 2017 strategic objectives and operational plans.
Conference Call Information
The Company will host a conference call accompanied by a presentation of supporting materials today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results, recent developments, and progress on its tech-focused strategy. Speaking on the call will be Michael Durney, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Luc Grégoire, Chief Financial Officer.

The Company has provided certain non-GAAP financial information as additional information for its operating results.  These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures reported by other companies.  The Company believes that its presentation of non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock based compensation expense, other non-recurring income or expense ("Adjusted EBITDA") and Adjusted EBITDA margin provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company's management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the Company and for budgeting and planning purposes.  The non-GAAP measures apply to consolidated results and results by segment or other measure as shown within this document.  The Company has provided required reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures elsewhere in the document.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA MarginAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP metrics used by management to measure operating performance.  Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for internal monitoring and planning, including preparation of annual budgets, analyzing investment decisions and evaluating profitability and performance comparisons between us and our competitors.  The Company also uses this measure to calculate amounts of performance based compensation under the senior management incentive bonus program.  Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement, represents net income plus (to the extent deducted in calculating such net income) interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock option expenses, losses resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business, certain writeoffs in connection with indebtedness, impairment charges with respect to long-lived assets, expenses incurred in connection with an equity offering, extraordinary or non-recurring non-cash expenses or losses, transaction costs in connection with the Credit Agreement up to $250,000, deferred revenues written off in connection with acquisition purchase accounting adjustments, writeoff of non-cash stock compensation expense, and business interruption insurance proceeds, minus (to the extent included in calculating such net income) non-cash income or gains, interest income, and any income or gain resulting from certain dispositions outside the ordinary course of business.
We present Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that this measure provides our board of directors, management and investors with additional information to measure our performance, provide comparisons from period to period and company to company by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense) and tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses), and to estimate our value.
We also present Adjusted EBITDA because covenants in our Credit Agreement contain ratios based on this measure.  Our Credit Agreement is material to us because it is one of our primary sources of liquidity.  If our Adjusted EBITDA were to decline below certain levels, covenants in our Credit Agreement that are based on Adjusted EBITDA may be violated and could cause a default and acceleration of payment obligations under our Credit Agreement.
Adjusted EBITDA Margin is computed as Adjusted EBITDA divided by Revenues. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability.
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release and oral statements made from time to time by our representatives contain forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on those statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include information without limitation concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategy. These statements often include words such as "may," "will," "should," "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "estimate" or similar expressions.  These statements are based on assumptions that we have made in light of our experience in the industry as well as our perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual financial results or results of operations and could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements.  These factors include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute our tech-focused strategy, the review of potential dispositions of certain of our businesses and the terms and timing of any such transactions, competition from existing and future competitors in the highly competitive market in which we operate, failure to adapt our business model to keep pace with rapid changes in the recruiting and career services business, failure to maintain and develop our reputation and brand recognition, failure to increase or maintain the number of customers who purchase recruitment packages, cyclicality or downturns in the economy or industries we serve, the uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom's future departure from the European Union, including uncertainty in respect of the regulation of data protection and data privacy, failure to attract qualified professionals to our websites or grow the number of qualified professionals who use our websites, failure to successfully identify or integrate acquisitions, U.S. and foreign government regulation of the Internet and taxation, our ability to borrow funds under our revolving credit facility or refinance our indebtedness and restrictions on our current and future operations under such indebtedness.  These factors and others are discussed in more detail in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, all of which are available on the Investors page of our website at www.dhigroupinc.com, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, under the headings "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." 
You should keep in mind that any forward-looking statement made by the Company or its representatives herein, or elsewhere, speaks only as of the date on which it is made. New risks and uncertainties come up from time to time, and it is impossible to predict these events or how they may affect us. We have no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date hereof, except as required by applicable law.
