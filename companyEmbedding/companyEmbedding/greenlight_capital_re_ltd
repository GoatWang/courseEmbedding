	NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(UNAUDITED)




	 




	March 31, 2017






	 




	 








	1


	.  


	ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION






	 




	Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE”) was incorporated as an exempted company under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands on July 13, 2004. GLRE’s principal wholly-owned subsidiary, Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd. (“Greenlight Re”), provides global specialty property and casualty reinsurance. Greenlight Re has a Class D insurer license issued in accordance with the terms of The Insurance Law, 2010 and underlying regulations thereto (the “Law”) and is subject to regulation by the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (“CIMA”), in terms of the Law. Greenlight Re commenced underwriting in April 2006. During 2008, Verdant Holding Company, Ltd. (“Verdant”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GLRE, was incorporated in the state of Delaware. During 2010, GLRE established Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company (“GRIL”), a wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiary based in Dublin, Ireland. GRIL is authorized as a non-life reinsurance undertaking in accordance with the provisions of the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (“Irish Regulations”). GRIL provides multi-line property and casualty reinsurance capacity to the European broker market and provides GLRE with an additional platform to serve clients located in Europe and North America.  As used herein, the “Company” refers collectively to GLRE and its consolidated subsidiaries.









	The Class A ordinary shares of GLRE are listed on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GLRE”.









	These unaudited


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. These unaudited


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	. In the opinion of management, these unaudited


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements reflect all of the normal recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position and results of operations as of the dates and for the periods presented.









	The results for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full calendar year.









	Reclassifications




	During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company revised its classification of the lines of business presented in Note


	10


	 of the


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements. As a result the gross written premiums relating to certain lines of business previously reported for the three months ended March 31, 2016 , have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The reclassification resulted in no changes to net income (loss) or retained earnings for any of the periods presented.

	.  


	SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 




	Use of Estimates




	 




	The preparation of


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

	Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 




	The Company is required to maintain certain cash in segregated accounts with prime brokers and derivative counterparties. The amount of restricted cash held by prime brokers is primarily used to support the liability created from securities sold, not yet purchased and derivatives. Additionally, restricted cash and cash equivalent balances are held to collateralize regulatory trusts and letters of credit issued to cedents (see Notes


	4


	 and


	9


	). The amount of cash encumbered varies depending on the market value of the securities sold, not yet purchased, and the collateral required by the cedents in the form of trust accounts and letters of credit. In addition, derivative counterparties require cash collateral to support the current value of any amounts that may be due to the counterparty based on the value of the underlying financial instrument.









	Premium Revenue Recognition 









	The Company accounts for reinsurance contracts in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the event that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk, deposit accounting is used and the contract is reported as a deposit liability. 









	The Company writes excess of loss contracts as well as quota share contracts. The Company estimates the ultimate premiums for the entire contract period. These estimates are based on information received from the ceding companies and estimates from actuarial pricing models used by the Company. For excess of loss contracts, the total ultimate estimated premiums are recorded as premiums written at the inception of the contract. For quota share contracts, the premiums are recorded as written based on cession statements from cedents which typically are received monthly or quarterly depending on the terms specified in each contract. For any reporting lag, premiums written are estimated based on the portion of the ultimate estimated premiums relating to the risks underwritten during the lag period. 









	Premium estimates are reviewed by management at least quarterly. Such review includes a comparison of actual reported premiums to expected ultimate premiums along with a review of the aging and collection of premium estimates. Based on management’s review, the appropriateness of the premium estimates is evaluated, and any adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Changes in premium estimates, including premium receivable on both excess of loss and quota share contracts, are expected and may result in significant adjustments in any period. A significant portion of amounts included in reinsurance balances receivable represent estimated premiums written, net of commissions and brokerage, and are not currently due based on the terms of the underlying contracts.









	Certain contracts allow for reinstatement premiums in the event of a full limit loss prior to the expiry of a contract. A reinstatement premium is not due until there is a full limit loss event and therefore, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company records a reinstatement premium as written only in the event that a client incurs a full limit loss on the contract and the contract allows for a reinstatement of coverage upon payment of an additional premium. For catastrophe contracts which contractually require the payment of a reinstatement premium equal to or greater than the original premium upon the occurrence of a full limit loss, the reinstatement premiums are earned over the original contract period. Reinstatement premiums that are contractually calculated on a pro-rata basis of the original premiums, are earned over the remaining coverage period. For additional premiums which are due on a contract that has no remaining coverage period, the additional premiums are earned in full when due.









	Certain contracts may provide for a penalty to be paid if the contract is terminated and canceled prior to its expiration term. Cancellation penalties are recognized in the period the notice of cancellation is received and are recorded in the consolidated statements of income under “other income (expense), net”.






	Premiums written are generally recognized as earned over the contract period in proportion to the period of risk covered. Unearned premiums consist of the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided.









	Deferred Acquisition Costs




	 




	Policy acquisition costs, such as commission and brokerage costs, relate directly to, and vary with, the writing of reinsurance contracts. Acquisition costs relating solely to bound contracts are deferred subject to ultimate recoverability and are amortized over the related contract term. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs by determining if the sum of future earned premiums and anticipated investment income is greater than the expected future claims and expenses. If a loss is probable on the unexpired portion of policies in force, a premium deficiency loss is recognized. At


	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016


	, the deferred acquisition costs were considered fully recoverable and


	no


	 premium deficiency loss was recorded. 













	8









	Return to table of contents














	Acquisition costs also include profit commissions which are expensed when incurred. Profit commissions are calculated and accrued based on the expected loss experience for contracts and recorded when the current loss estimate indicates that a profit commission is probable under the contract terms. As of


	March 31, 2017


	,


	$17.9 million


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$15.2 million


	) of profit commission reserves were included in reinsurance balances payable on the


	condensed consolidated


	 balance sheets. 


	For the three months ended March 31, 2017


	,


	$2.7 million


	 (


	2016


	:


	$1.1 million


	) of net profit commission expense was included in acquisition costs in the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of income.




	  




	Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves and Recoverable




	 




	The Company establishes reserves for contracts based on estimates of the ultimate cost of all losses including losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). These estimated ultimate reserves are based on the Company’s own actuarial estimates derived from reports received from ceding companies, industry data and historical experience. These estimates are reviewed by the Company periodically on a contract by contract basis and adjusted as necessary. Since reserves are estimates, the final settlement of losses may vary from the reserves established and any adjustments to the estimates, which may be material, are recorded in the period they are determined.




	 




	Loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable include the amounts due from retrocessionaires for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses on retrocession agreements. Ceded losses incurred but not reported are estimated based on the Company’s actuarial estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and adjusted when deemed necessary. The Company may not be able to ultimately recover the loss and loss adjustment expense recoverable amounts due to the retrocessionaires’ inability to pay. The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires and records provisions for uncollectible reinsurance expenses recoverable when recovery is no longer probable.









	Consideration paid by the Company for retroactive reinsurance that meets the conditions for reinsurance accounting (e.g. loss portfolio transfers) are reported as loss and loss adjustment expenses recoverable to the extent those amounts do not exceed the associated liabilities. If the amounts paid for retroactive reinsurance exceed the liabilities, the Company increases the related liabilities, at the time the reinsurance contract is effective, and the excess is charged to net income as losses incurred. If the liabilities exceed the amounts paid, the recoverable balance is increased to reflect the difference, and the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the estimated loss payout period. Changes in the estimated amount of liabilities relating to the underlying reinsured contracts are recognized in net income in the period of the change.









	 


	Notes Receivable




	 




	Notes receivable include promissory notes receivable from third party entities. These notes are recorded at cost along with accrued interest, if any, which approximates the fair value. Interest income and realized gains or losses on sale of notes receivable are included under net investment income (loss) in the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of income.









	The Company regularly reviews all notes receivable individually for impairment and records valuation allowance provisions for uncollectible and non-performing notes. The Company places notes on non-accrual status when the recorded value of the note is not considered impaired but there is uncertainty as to the collection of interest in accordance with the terms of the note. For notes receivable placed on non-accrual status, the notes are recorded excluding any accrued interest amount. The Company resumes accrual of interest on a note when none of the principal or interest remains past due, and the Company expects to collect the remaining contractual principal and interest. Interest collected on notes that are placed on non-accrual status is treated on a cash-basis and recorded as interest income when collected, provided that the recorded value of the note is deemed to be fully collectible. Where doubt exists as to the collectability of the remaining recorded value of the notes placed on non-accrual status, any payments received are applied to reduce the recorded value of the notes.









	At


	March 31, 2017


	,


	$17.4 million


	 of notes receivable (net of any valuation allowance) were on non-accrual status




	(


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$18.6 million


	) and any payments received were applied to reduce the recorded value of the notes.




	 




	At


	March 31, 2017


	 and


	December 31, 2016


	, there was


	no


	 accrued interest included in the notes receivable balance. Based on management’s assessment, the recorded values of the notes receivable, net of valuation allowance, at


	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016


	, were expected to be fully collectible.

	Financial Instruments




	 




	Investments in Securities and Investments in Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased




	 




	The Company’s investments in debt instruments and equity securities that are classified as “trading securities” are carried at fair value. The fair values of the listed equity investments are derived based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 inputs). The fair values of listed equities that have restrictions on sale or transfer which expire within one year, are determined by adjusting the observed market price of the equity using a liquidity discount based on observable market inputs. The fair values of debt instruments are derived based on inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as market maker or broker quotes reflecting recent transactions (Level 2 inputs), and are generally derived based on the average of multiple market maker or broker quotes which are considered to be binding. Where quotes are not available, debt instruments are valued using cash flow models using assumptions and estimates that may be subjective and non-observable (Level 3 inputs).









	The Company’s “other investments” may include investments in private and unlisted equity securities, limited partnerships and commodities, which are all carried at fair value. The fair values of commodities are determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1). The Company maximizes the use of observable direct or indirect inputs (Level 2 inputs) when deriving the fair values for “other investments”. For limited partnerships and private and unlisted equity securities, where observable inputs are not available, the fair values are derived based on unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs) such as management’s assumptions developed from available information using the services of the investment advisor, including the most recent net asset values obtained from the managers of those underlying investments. For certain private equity fund investments the Company has elected to measure the fair value using the net asset value practical expedient allowed under U.S. GAAP, and accordingly these investments are not classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 in the fair value hierarchy.









	For securities classified as “trading securities” and “other investments”, any realized and unrealized gains or losses are determined on the basis of the specific identification method (by reference to cost or amortized cost, as appropriate) and included in net investment income (loss) in the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of income.









	Dividend income and expense are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The ex-dividend date is the date as of when the underlying security must have been traded to be eligible for the dividend declared. Interest income and interest expense are recorded on an accrual basis.




	 




	Derivative Financial Instruments




	 




	U.S. GAAP requires that an entity recognize all derivatives in the balance sheet at fair value. It also requires that unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value be included in income or comprehensive income, depending on whether the instrument qualifies as a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. The Company’s derivative financial instrument assets are included in financial contracts receivable. Derivative financial instrument liabilities are included in financial contracts payable. The Company’s derivatives generally do not qualify as hedges for financial reporting purposes and are recorded in the


	condensed consolidated


	 balance sheets on a gross basis and not offset against any collateral pledged or received. Pursuant to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) master agreements, securities lending agreements and other agreements, the Company and its counterparties typically have the ability to net certain payments owed to each other in specified circumstances. In addition, in the event a party to one of the ISDA master agreements, securities lending agreements or other agreements defaults, or a transaction is otherwise subject to termination, the non-defaulting party generally has the right to set off outstanding balances due from the defaulting party against payments owed to the defaulting party or collateral held by the non-defaulting party. The Company may from time to time enter into underwriting contracts such as industry loss warranty contracts (“ILW”) that are treated as derivatives for U.S GAAP purposes.




	 




	Financial Contracts









	The Company enters into financial contracts with counterparties as part of its investment strategy. Financial contracts, which include total return swaps, credit default swaps (“CDS”), futures, options, currency forwards and other derivative instruments, are recorded at their fair value with any unrealized gains and losses included in net investment income (loss) in the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of income. Financial contracts receivable represents derivative contracts whereby, based upon the contract’s current fair value, the Company will be entitled to receive payments upon settlement of the contract. Financial contracts payable represents derivative contracts whereby, based upon each contract’s current fair value, the Company will be obligated to make payments upon settlement of the contract.




	 








	10









	Return to table of contents














	Total return swap agreements, included on the


	condensed consolidated


	 balance sheets as financial contracts receivable and financial contracts payable, are derivative financial instruments whereby the Company is either entitled to receive or obligated to pay the product of a notional amount multiplied by the movement in an underlying security, which the Company may not own, over a specified time frame. In addition, the Company may also be obligated to pay or receive other payments based on interest rates, dividend payments and receipts, or foreign exchange movements during a specified period. The Company measures its rights or obligations to the counterparty based on the fair value movements of the underlying security together with any other payments due. These contracts are carried at fair value, based on observable inputs (Level 2 inputs) with the resultant unrealized gains and losses reflected in net investment income (loss) in the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of income. Additionally, any changes in the value of amounts received or paid on swap contracts are reported as a gain or loss in net investment income (loss) in the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of income.




	 




	Financial contracts may also include exchange traded futures or options contracts that are based on the movement of a particular index, equity security, commodity, currency or interest rate. Where such contracts are traded in an active market, the Company’s obligations or rights on these contracts are recorded at fair value based on the observable quoted prices of the same or similar financial contracts in an active market (Level 1) or on broker quotes which reflect market information based on actual transactions (Level 2). Amounts invested in exchange traded options and over the counter (“OTC”) options are recorded either as an asset or liability at inception. Subsequent to initial recognition, unexpired exchange traded option contracts are recorded at fair value based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). For OTC options or exchange traded options where a quoted price in an active market is not available, fair values are derived based upon observable inputs (Level 2) such as multiple quotes from brokers and market makers, which are considered to be binding.




	 




	The Company may purchase and sell CDS for strategic investment purposes. A CDS is a derivative instrument that provides protection against an investment loss due to specified credit or default events of a reference entity. The seller of a CDS guarantees to pay the buyer a specified amount if the reference entity defaults on its obligations or fails to perform. The buyer of a CDS pays a premium over time to the seller in exchange for obtaining this protection. A CDS trading in an active market is valued at fair value based on broker or market maker quotes for identical instruments in an active market (Level 2) or based on the current credit spreads on identical contracts (Level 2).









	Comprehensive Income (Loss)









	The Company has no comprehensive income or loss, other than the net income or loss disclosed in the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of income.









	Earnings (Loss) Per Share




	 




	Basic earnings per share are based on the weighted average number of common shares and participating securities outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of restricted stock units (“RSU”) and additional potential common shares issuable when stock options are exercised and are determined using the treasury stock method. The Company treats its unvested restricted stock as participating securities in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires that unvested stock awards which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, whether paid or unpaid (referred to as “participating securities”), be included in the number of shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. In the event of a net loss, all RSUs, stock options outstanding and participating securities are excluded from the calculation of both basic and diluted loss per share since their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

	Under current Cayman Islands law, no corporate entity, including GLRE and Greenlight Re, is obligated to pay taxes in the Cayman Islands on either income or capital gains. The Company has an undertaking from the Governor-in-Cabinet of the Cayman Islands, pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Concessions Law, as amended, that, in the event that the Cayman Islands enacts any legislation that imposes tax on profits, income, gains or appreciations, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, such tax will not be applicable to GLRE, Greenlight Re nor their respective operations, or to the Class A or Class B ordinary shares or related obligations, until February 1, 2025.




	 




	Verdant is incorporated in Delaware and therefore is subject to taxes in accordance with the U.S. federal rates and regulations prescribed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). Verdant’s taxable income is generally expected to be taxed at a rate of


	35%


	.









	GRIL is incorporated in Ireland and therefore is subject to the Irish corporation tax rate of


	12.5%


	 on its trading income, and


	25%


	 on its non-trading income, if any.









	Any deferred tax asset is evaluated for recovery and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future. The Company has not taken any income tax positions that are subject to significant uncertainty or that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company. 









	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	    




	In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-09, “Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2015-09”). ASU 2015-09 requires additional disclosures for short-duration contracts including incurred and paid claims development information, claims duration information, quantitative claims frequency information (unless impracticable), and an explanation of significant changes in methodologies and assumptions used to calculate the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. ASU 2015-09 is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2015-09 during 2016 and disclosed the additional information in its


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The Company has implemented the interim disclosures commencing from the first quarter of 2017. Please refer to Note


	5


	 “Loss and Loss Adjustments Expense Reserves” for the interim disclosures relating to ASU 2015-09.









	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU 2016-01”)


	.


	 The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. ASU 2016-01, among other things, requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income or loss, requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes and requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset. ASU 2016-01 affects public and private companies, not-for-profit organizations, and employee benefit plans that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-01 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s net income or loss or retained earnings since the Company’s investments are currently classified as “trading” and the unrealized gains and losses are already recognized in net income or loss.









	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”)


	.


	Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. The Company currently has two operating leases for its office spaces as disclosed in Note


	9


	  of the


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and anticipates implementing ASU 2016-02 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.

	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting” (“ASU 2016-09”)


	.


	 ASU 2016-09 is intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments and affects all organizations that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including: 


	(a)


	 income tax consequences; 


	(b)


	 classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and 


	(c)


	classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. The Company adopted ASU 2016-09 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.









	In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASU 2016-13”)


	.


	 ASU 2016-13 amends the guidance on reporting credits losses and affects loans, debt securities, trade receivables, reinsurance recoverables and other financial assets that have the contractual right to receive cash. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any organization for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the requirements of ASU 2016-13 on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and anticipates implementing ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.









	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, “Statements of Cash Flows - Restricted Cash (Topic 230)” (“ASU 2016-18”). ASU 2016-18 requires restricted cash and cash equivalents to be included with cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows and disclose the nature of the restrictions on cash and cash equivalents. ASU 2016-18 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company currently presents changes in restricted cash and cash equivalents under investing activities in the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of cash flows. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-18, the Company will amend the presentation in the statement of cash flows to include the restricted cash and cash equivalents with cash and cash equivalents in the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of cash flows and will retrospectively reclassify all periods presented.

	 Fair Value Hierarchy









	The Company’s financial instruments are carried at fair value, and the net unrealized gains or losses are included in net investment income (loss) in the

	. The private equity funds have varying lock-up periods and, as of

	Investments in Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased


	 









	Securities sold, not yet purchased, are securities that the Company has sold, but does not own, in anticipation of a decline in the market value of the security. The Company’s risk is that the value of the security will increase rather than decline. Consequently, the settlement amount of the liability for securities sold, not yet purchased, may exceed the amount recorded in the


	condensed consolidated


	 balance sheet as the Company is obligated to purchase the securities sold, not yet purchased, in the market at prevailing prices to settle its obligations. To establish a position in a security sold, not yet purchased, the Company needs to borrow the security for delivery to the buyer. On each day the transaction is open, the liability for the obligation to replace the borrowed security is marked-to-market and an unrealized gain or loss is recorded. At the time the transaction is closed, the Company realizes a gain or loss equal to the difference between the price at which the security was sold and the cost of replacing the borrowed security. While the transaction is open, the Company will also incur an expense for any dividends or interest which will be paid to the lender of the securities.

	Options are derivative financial instruments that give the buyer, in exchange for a premium payment, the right, but not the obligation, to either purchase from (call option) or sell to (put option) the writer, a specified underlying security at a specified price on or before a specified date. The Company enters into option contracts to meet certain investment objectives. For exchange traded option contracts, the exchange acts as the counterparty to specific transactions and therefore bears the risk of delivery to and from counterparties of specific positions.

	DUE TO PRIME BROKERS






	 




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, the amount due to prime brokers was comprised of margin-borrowing from prime brokers relating to investments purchased on margin, as well as margin-borrowing for providing collateral to support some of the Company’s outstanding letters of credit (see Note


	9


	) and trust accounts. Under term margin agreements and certain letter of credit facility agreements, the Company pledges certain investment securities to borrow cash from the prime brokers. The borrowed cash is placed in a custodial account in the name of the Company and this custodial account provides collateral for any letters of credit issued. Similarly for the trust accounts, the Company may borrow cash from prime brokers which is placed in a trust account for the benefit of the cedent. Since there is no legal right of offset, the Company’s liability for the cash borrowed from the prime brokers is included on the


	condensed consolidated


	 balance sheets as due to prime brokers while the cash held in the custodial account and trust account is included on the


	condensed consolidated


	 balance sheets as restricted cash and cash equivalents. 









	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, Greenlight Re’s investment guidelines, (which may be amended from time to time by the board of directors) allows for up to

	RETROCESSION






	 




	The Company, from time to time, purchases retrocessional coverage for one or more of the following reasons: to manage its overall exposure, to reduce its net liability on individual risks, to obtain additional underwriting capacity or to balance its underwriting portfolio. Additionally, retrocession can be used as a mechanism to share the risks and rewards of business written and, therefore, can be used as a tool to align the Company’s interests with those of its counterparties. The Company currently has coverage that provides for recovery of a portion of loss and loss expenses incurred on certain contracts. Loss and loss adjustment expense recoverable from the retrocessionaires are recorded as assets.









	For the three months ended March 31, 2017


	, loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred of


	$104.8 million


	 (


	2016


	:


	$90.7 million


	), reported on the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of income are net of loss and loss expenses recovered and recoverable of


	$0.1 million


	 (


	2016


	:


	$0.4 million


	).









	Retrocession contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to the insureds. Failure of retrocessionaires to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. At


	March 31, 2017


	, the Company had losses receivable and loss reserves recoverable of


	$2.1 million


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$2.2 million


	) from unrated retrocessionaires which were secured by cash collateral held by the Company. At


	March 31, 2017


	,


	$0.5 million


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$0.5 million


	) of losses recoverable were from a retrocessionaire rated A- by A.M. Best.









	 The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires to assess the ability of the retrocessionaires to honor their respective obligations. At


	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016


	,


	no


	 provision for uncollectible losses recoverable was considered necessary.

	SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION






	 




	The Company has a stock incentive plan for directors, employees and consultants that is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company’s shares authorized for issuance pursuant to the stock incentive plan include


	3,500,000


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:

	) Class A ordinary shares remained available for future issuance under the Company’s stock incentive plan.




	 




	Employee and Director Restricted Shares




	 




	As part of its stock incentive plan, the Company issues restricted shares for which the fair value is equal to the price of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares on the grant date. Compensation based on the grant date fair market value of the shares is expensed on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period, net of any estimated forfeitures.

	,

	) restricted Class A ordinary shares were issued to employees pursuant to the Company’s stock incentive plan. These shares contain certain restrictions relating to, among other things, vesting, forfeiture in the event of termination of employment and transferability. Each of these restricted shares cliff vest after


	three years


	 from the date of issuance, subject to the grantee’s continued service with the Company. During the vesting period, the holder of the restricted shares retains voting rights and is entitled to any dividends declared by the Company.

	RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS


	 




	 




	Investment Advisory Agreement




	 




	The Company and its reinsurance subsidiaries are party to a joint venture agreement with DME Advisors, LP (“DME Advisors”) under which the Company, its reinsurance subsidiaries and DME Advisors LLC (“DME”) are participants of a joint venture for the purpose of managing certain jointly held assets, as may be amended from time to time (the “venture agreement”). In addition, the Company, its reinsurance subsidiaries and DME have entered into a separate investment advisory agreement with DME Advisors, as may be amended from time to time (the “advisory agreement”). Effective January 1, 2017, the venture agreement and the advisory agreement were amended and restated to replace the previous agreements dated January 1, 2014, and will expire on


	December 31, 2019


	 and renew automatically for successive three-year periods. DME and DME Advisors are related to the Company and each is an affiliate of David Einhorn, Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors.




	 




	Pursuant to the venture agreement, performance allocation equal to


	20%


	 of the net investment income of the Company’s share of the account managed by DME Advisors is allocated, subject to a loss carry forward provision, to DME’s account. The loss carry forward provision requires DME to earn a reduced performance allocation of


	10%


	 on net investment income in any year subsequent to the year in which the investment account incurs a loss, until all the losses are recouped and an additional amount equal to


	150%


	 of the aggregate investment loss is earned. DME is not entitled to earn a performance allocation in a year in which the investment portfolio incurs a loss.


	For the three months ended March 31, 2017


	,


	$1.2 million


	 performance allocation (


	2016


	:


	$3.1 million


	) was deducted from gross investment income.  









	Pursuant to the advisory agreement, a monthly management fee, equal to


	0.125%


	 (


	1.5%


	 on an annual basis) of the Company’s investment account managed by DME Advisors, is paid to DME Advisors. Included in the net investment income for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 were management fees of


	$4.3 million


	 (


	2016


	:


	$4.2 million


	). The management fees have been fully paid as of


	March 31, 2017


	.




	 




	Pursuant to the venture and advisory agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify DME and DME Advisors for any expense, loss, liability, or damage arising out of any claim asserted or threatened in connection with DME Advisors serving as the Company’s investment advisor. The Company will reimburse DME and DME Advisors for reasonable costs and expenses of investigating and/or defending such claims, provided such claims were not caused due to gross negligence, breach of contract or misrepresentation by DME or DME Advisors.


	For the three months ended March 31, 2017


	, there were no indemnification payments payable or paid by the Company.









	Green Brick Partners, Inc.









	David Einhorn also serves as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Green Brick Partners, Inc. (“GRBK”), a publicly traded company. As of

	$34.5 million


	 (


	December 31, 2016

The Company along with certain affiliates of DME Advisors, collectively own 49% of the issued and outstanding common shares of GRBK. Under applicable securities laws, DME Advisors may be limited at times in its ability to trade GRBK shares on behalf of the Company.

	Given the nature of these investments, the Company is unable to determine with any degree of accuracy when these commitments will be called.

	Litigation




	 




	From time to time, in the normal course of business, the Company may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution procedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine the rights and obligations under the Company’s reinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, the Company may seek to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds owing to it. In other matters, the Company may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company does not believe that any existing dispute, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or operating results.

	Item 2.    MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	 




	References to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our company,”  or “the Company” refer to Greenlight Capital Re, Ltd. (“GLRE”) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Greenlight Reinsurance, Ltd, (“Greenlight Re”), Greenlight Reinsurance Ireland, Designated Activity Company (“GRIL”) and Verdant Holding Company, Ltd. (“Verdant”), unless the context dictates otherwise. References to our “Ordinary Shares” refers collectively to our Class A Ordinary Shares and Class B Ordinary Shares.




	 




	The following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016


	 and financial condition as of


	March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016


	. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, which appear in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended


	December 31, 2016


	.




	 








	Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements




	 




	Certain statements in Management’s Discussion and Analysis, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words “believe,” “project,” “predict,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “may,” “should,” “will,” “would,” “will be,” “will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in the section entitled “Risk Factors” (refer to Part I, Item 1A) contained in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended


	December 31, 2016


	. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements which speak only to the dates on which they were made.




	 




	We intend to communicate certain events that we believe may have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position, including property and casualty catastrophic events and material losses in our investment portfolio, in a timely manner through a public announcement. Other than as required by the Exchange Act, we do not intend to make public announcements regarding reinsurance or investment events that we do not believe, based on management’s estimates and current information, will have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial position.













	General




	 




	We are a global specialty property and casualty reinsurer, headquartered in the Cayman Islands, with a reinsurance and investment strategy that we believe differentiates us from most of our competitors. Our goal is to build long-term shareholder value by selectively offering customized reinsurance solutions, in markets where capacity and alternatives are limited, which we believe will yield favorable long-term returns on equity.




	 




	We aim to complement our underwriting results with a non-traditional investment approach in order to achieve higher rates of return over the long term than reinsurance companies that employ more traditional, fixed-income investment strategies. We manage our investment portfolio according to a value-oriented philosophy, in which we take long positions in perceived undervalued securities and short positions in perceived overvalued securities.




	 




	Because we employ an opportunistic underwriting philosophy, period-to-period comparisons of our underwriting results may not be meaningful. In addition, our historical investment results may not necessarily be indicative of future performance. Due to the nature of our reinsurance and investment strategies, our operating results will likely fluctuate from period to period.













	Segments




	 




	We manage our business on the basis of one operating segment, property and casualty reinsurance, in accordance with the qualitative and quantitative criteria established by U.S. GAAP. Within the property and casualty reinsurance segment, we analyze our underwriting operations using two categories:








	30









	Return to table of contents































	 






	●






	frequency business; and 








	 






	●






	severity business.









	Frequency business is generally characterized as contracts containing a potentially large number of small losses emanating from multiple events. Clients generally buy this protection to increase their own underwriting capacity and typically select a reinsurer based upon the reinsurer’s financial strength, service and expertise. We expect the results of frequency business to be less volatile than those of severity business from period to period due to greater predictability. We also expect that over time the profit margins and return on equity of our frequency business will be lower than those of our severity business.




	 




	Severity business is generally characterized as contracts with the potential for significant losses emanating from one event or multiple events. Clients generally buy this protection to remove volatility from their balance sheets, and accordingly, we expect the results of severity business to be volatile from period to period. However, over the long term, we also expect that our severity business will generate higher profit margins and return on equity than those of our frequency business.













	Outlook and Trends









	The reinsurance industry has experienced significant consolidation in the last several years, fueled by many traditional participants with excess capital looking to strengthen their positions in their respective core markets. We believe further consolidation will likely continue but do not believe that consolidation will result in a significant reduction in total capital within the industry. Rather, we expect the industry consolidation to create concentrations of capital in fewer, larger participants, and that with a reduction in the number of competitors in the industry, pricing may partially stabilize. Further, while some opportunities may become available on an attractive basis to only the largest reinsurance companies in the industry, we believe that the consolidation trend may create new opportunities for us if less capacity is available in the market as a result of industry consolidation.









	We do not believe that the over-capitalization of the market is uniform across all industry participants and there are many insurers and reinsurers with lower financial security profiles than ours that, we believe, have and will continue to suffer disproportionately. We believe the value proposition of our reinsurance capabilities and our differentiated underwriting strategy positions us well to compete for new, targeted business in niche areas that we know and can service well.









	A key part of our underwriting strategy is to identify and partner with companies that have suffered dislocation. Accordingly, given declining or flat investment earnings for fixed income investors resulting from a prolonged low interest rate environment, we believe underwriting opportunities may increase, which we intend to pursue where we believe pricing is economically rational. Conversely, if attractive opportunities are not available on economically rational terms, we anticipate that we will seek to maintain or even reduce premium writings rather than accept mispriced risk in order to conserve our capital for a more opportune environment. We believe that significant price increases could occur if financial and credit markets experience adverse shocks that result in the loss of capital of insurers and reinsurers, or if there are major catastrophic events, especially in North America.









	We have recently observed stability and favorable trends in our underlying rates for our non-standard automobile business, which we believe adequately compensates insurers for increased claims frequency trends in private passenger auto. We expect to have a high concentration of premium in this line for the foreseeable future.









	We have observed an increase in the demand for U.S. health stop loss insurance as more employers seek to control health care costs by pursuing alternatives to first dollar health care plans subject to the Affordable Care Act. We believe that the majority of the demand has been underwritten by large carriers that elect to not purchase reinsurance, although we also believe that a portion has been underwritten by managing general underwriters, who often rely heavily on quota share reinsurance. We will to seek to increase our market share from managing general underwriters that operate in this line. We will continue to monitor any proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act under the new U.S. administration and react to potential impacts to this line of business.









	Private U.S. mortgage insurers appear to be increasingly seeking quota share reinsurance options as a result of the implementation of the Private Mortgage Insurers Eligibility Requirements (PMIERS) in the United States, which effectively increases the cost of capital for the private mortgage insurers. We believe the credit underwriting standards for U.S. mortgages are good and, as a result, the risk-adjusted profitability of these portfolios is satisfactory. We expect that reinsurance of U.S. mortgage risk will become a growing part of our underwriting portfolio during 2017.













	31









	Return to table of contents














	Our casualty business is generally comprised of larger, syndicated reinsurance placements for general casualty, professional liability and workers’ compensation. For most of this business, we are not the lead underwriter, and instead, we generally follow the market on these transactions. This business has a longer duration of claim payments than other types of business that we have historically written, which leads to a build-up of reserves and exposure over a longer period of time. While our casualty business has grown in recent years, we expect this portion of our business to remain at 2016 levels during 2017 unless we find additional attractive opportunities.









	We note that pricing for property catastrophe retro and other property catastrophe business has been and continues to be under severe competitive pressure and we believe much of the business in the market is being priced below expected losses. As such, we have decreased our focus on property catastrophe retro over the past several years until there is a market changing event that improves expected profitability.









	Underlying rates for Florida homeowners’ insurance continue to decline and water damage claims and fraudulent assignment of benefit (“AOB”) claims continue to increase expected losses. The Florida Legislature did not address the AOB problem during legislative sessions in 2016. Our expectation is that AOB claims will continue during 2017, which will result in less attractive profit margins on this business. Despite this, we believe that the reinsurance terms and conditions continue to be highly competitive. We have significantly reduced our exposure to Florida homeowners’ insurance and are monitoring changes to the legal and political environment with regards to the AOB issue.




	 




	While competitive market conditions have made it challenging to find and successfully underwrite new business that meets our targeted return hurdles, we believe that we have a strong pipeline of attractive opportunities with counterparties that seek highly customized structures, terms and conditions, which aligns well with our underwriting strategy. During the January 1, 2017 renewal period, our renewals were at historically comparable levels and we continue to see new opportunities. We will continue to monitor market conditions and pursue opportunities to best position ourselves to participate in future under-served or capacity-constrained markets as they arise, and intend to offer products that we believe will generate favorable returns on equity over the long term. Accordingly, our underlying results and product line concentrations in any given period may vary, perhaps significantly, and are not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations.









	Our investment portfolio had a net long exposure of


	27.3%


	 as of


	March 31, 2017


	. Our goal for 2017 is to protect capital in an uncertain environment and to find investment opportunities on both our long and short portfolios that we believe will generate positive returns. Despite the recent Federal Reserve interest rate increases, monetary policy remains very accommodative globally.  Additionally, there are many global economic, investment and political uncertainties and risks that may impact our business. Given the uncertainties, we deem it appropriate to maintain comparatively lower net equity exposures and to hold a significant position in gold and other macro positions.













	Critical Accounting Policies




	 




	Our


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and have required management to make assumptions and best estimates to determine reported values. If certain factors, including those described in “Part I. Item IA. — Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, cause actual events or results to differ materially from our underlying assumptions or estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We believe that the critical accounting policies set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended


	December 31, 2016


	 affect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements. These accounting policies pertain to premium revenues and risk transfer, valuation of investments, loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, acquisition costs, bonus accruals and share-based payments.




	 




	Recently issued accounting standards and their impact to the Company, if any, are presented under “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note


	2


	 of the accompanying


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements. 













	Key Financial Measures and Non-GAAP Measures









	In addition to the consolidated financial statements, management uses certain key financial measures, some of which are not prescribed under U.S. GAAP rules and standards (“non-GAAP financial measures”), to evaluate our financial performance and the overall growth in shareholder value. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined in SEC Regulation G, is a numerical measure of a company’s historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that these measures, which may be calculated or defined differently by other companies, provide a consistent and comparable measure of performance of its businesses to help shareholders understand








	32









	Return to table of contents














	performance trends and allow for a more complete understanding of the Company’s business. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The key non-GAAP financial measures used in this report are:


















	•






	Basic adjusted book value per share;
















	•






	Fully diluted adjusted book value per share;
















	•






	Net underwriting income (loss);












	Basic Adjusted Book Value Per Share and Fully Diluted Adjusted Book Value Per Share









	We believe that long-term growth in fully diluted adjusted book value per share is the most relevant measure of our financial performance because it provides management and investors a yardstick by which to monitor the shareholder value generated. In addition, fully diluted adjusted book value per share may be useful to our investors, shareholders and other interested parties to form a basis of comparison with other companies within the property and casualty reinsurance industry.









	Basic adjusted book value per share is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes from the total equity the non-controlling interest in a joint venture. Fully diluted adjusted book value per share is also considered a non-GAAP financial measure and represents basic adjusted book value per share combined with the impact from dilution of all in-the-money stock options and RSUs issued and outstanding as of any period end. We adjust the total equity by excluding the non-controlling interest in a joint venture because it does not reflect the equity attributable to our shareholders. Basic adjusted book value per share and fully diluted adjusted book value per share should not be viewed as substitutes for the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.









	The following table presents a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures basic adjusted and fully diluted adjusted book value per share to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure.

	Net Underwriting Income (Loss)









	One way that management evaluates the Company’s underwriting performance is through the measurement of net underwriting income (loss). We do not use premiums written as a measure of performance. Net underwriting income (loss) is a performance measure used by management as it measures the underlying fundamentals of the Company’s underwriting operations. Management believes that the use of net underwriting income (loss) enables investors and other users of the Company’s financial information to analyze its performance in a manner similar to how management analyzes performance. Management also believes that this measure follows industry practice and, therefore, allows the users of financial information to compare the Company’s performance with its industry peer group.









	Net underwriting income (loss) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes items used in the calculation of net income before taxes under U.S. GAAP. The measure includes underwriting expenses which are directly related to underwriting activities as well as an allocation of other general and administrative expenses. Net underwriting income (loss) is calculated as net premiums earned, less net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred, less, acquisition costs and less underwriting expenses. The measure excludes, on a recurring basis: (1) net investment income; (2) any foreign exchange gains or losses; (3) corporate general and administrative expenses; (4) other income (expense) not related to underwriting, and (5) income taxes and income attributable to non-controlling interest. We exclude net investment income and foreign exchange gains or losses as we believe these are influenced by market conditions and other factors not related to underwriting decisions. We exclude corporate general and administrative expenses because these expenses are generally fixed and not incremental to or directly related to our underwriting operations. We believe all of these amounts are largely independent of our underwriting process and including them distorts the analysis of trends in our underwriting operations. Net underwriting income (loss) should not be viewed as a substitute for U.S. GAAP net income.









	The reconciliations of net underwriting income (loss) to income (loss) before income taxes (the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure) on a consolidated basis is shown below:

	Our primary financial goal is to increase the long-term value in fully diluted adjusted book value per share. For the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, the fully diluted adjusted book value per share


	increased


	 by


	$0.19


	 per share, or


	0.8%


	, to


	$23.57


	 per share from


	$23.38


	 per share at


	December 31, 2016


	. For the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, the basic adjusted book value per share


	increased


	 by


	$0.20


	 per share, or


	0.9%


	, to

	 was


	$11.6 million


	, compared to net investment income of


	$28.4 million


	 reported for the same period in 


	2016


	. Our investment portfolio reported a gain of


	0.9%


	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, compared to a gain of


	2.5%


	 for the same period in


	2016


	. The net underwriting loss for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017

	$0.2 million


	, compared to underwriting income of


	$3.7 million


	 reported for the same period in 


	2016


	. The decrease in underwriting income for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017

	Explanation








	Financial






	 






	The acquisition cost ratio for the transactional liability business is higher than other severity contracts. There was no transactional liability business during the comparable period in 2016. Therefore the acquisition cost ratio for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was higher than the same period in 2016.








	Specialty - Marine






	 






	An excess of loss contract written during 2016 had a low acquisition cost ratio which had helped reduce the overall severity acquisition cost ratio for the comparative three months ended March 31, 2016. Since this contract was not renewed during 2017, the overall severity acquisition cost ratio increased for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

	For the three months ended March 31, 2017


	, investment income, net of fees and expenses, resulted in a


	gain


	 of


	0.9%


	 on our investments managed by DME Advisors, compared to a


	gain


	 of


	2.5%


	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2016


	. The long portfolio and macro positions gained


	4.3%


	 and


	0.2%


	, respectively, while the short portfolio lost


	3.0%


	 during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	. For the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, the largest contributors to net investment income were long positions in Chemours ( CC), Apple (AAPL) and gold, while the largest detractors were long positions in Rite Aid Corp (RAD), and short positions in Tesla (TSLA) and a group of perceived overpriced momentum driven securities that we refer to as the “bubble basket”.









	For the three months ended March 31, 2017


	, included under “Investment advisor compensation” in the above table was


	$4.3 million


	 (


	2016


	:


	$4.2 million


	), relating to management fees paid to DME Advisors in accordance with the advisory agreement with DME Advisors. For the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	,


	$1.2 million


	 of performance allocation compensation was recorded for the period (


	2016


	:


	$3.1 million


	).









	We expect our investment income, including realized and unrealized gains (or losses), to fluctuate from period to period. Fluctuations in realized and unrealized gains (or losses) are a function of both the market performance of the securities held in our investment portfolio, and the timing of additions to and dispositions of securities in our investment portfolio. Our investment advisor uses its discretion over when a gain (or loss) is realized on a particular investment. We believe that net investment income, which includes both realized and unrealized gains (or losses), is the best way to assess our investment performance, rather than analyzing the realized gains (or losses) and unrealized gains (or losses) separately.











	For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016


	, the gross investment gain (loss) on our investment portfolio managed by DME Advisors (excluding investment advisor performance allocation) was


	1.0%


	 and


	2.8%


	, respectively. These were comprised of the following:

	DME Advisors and its affiliates manage and expect to manage other client accounts besides ours, some of which have investment objectives similar to ours. To comply with Regulation FD, our investment returns are posted on our website on a monthly basis. Additionally, our website (


	www.greenlightre.ky


	) provides the names of the largest disclosed long positions in our investment portfolio as of the last business day of the month of the relevant posting, as well as information on our long and short exposures. Although DME Advisors regularly discloses all investment positions to us, it may choose not to disclose certain positions to its other clients in order to protect its investment strategy. Therefore, we present on our website the relevant largest long positions and exposure information as disclosed by DME Advisors or its affiliates to their other clients.

	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, a deferred tax asset of


	$1.2 million


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$1.3 million


	) was included in other assets on the


	condensed consolidated


	 balance sheets. Based on the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income to realize the future tax benefit, management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully realized in the future and therefore no valuation allowance has been recorded. The Company has not taken any other tax positions that management believes are subject to uncertainty or that are reasonably likely to have a material impact to the Company, GRIL or Verdant.









	 


	   Ratio Analysis




	 






	Due to the unique and customized nature of our underwriting operations, we expect to report different loss and expense ratios in both our frequency and severity businesses from period to period.

	   The loss ratio is calculated by dividing loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned. We expect that the loss ratio will be volatile for our severity business and may exceed that of our frequency business in certain periods. Given that we opportunistically underwrite a concentrated portfolio across several lines of business that have varying expected loss ratios, we can expect there to be significant annual variations in the loss ratios reported from our frequency business. In addition, the loss ratios for both frequency and severity business can vary depending on the mix of the lines of business written. 









	The acquisition cost ratio is calculated by dividing acquisition costs by net premiums earned. We expect that this ratio will generally be higher for our frequency business than for our severity business.




	 




	The composite ratio is the ratio of underwriting losses incurred, loss adjustment expenses and acquisition costs, excluding underwriting related general and administrative expenses, to net premiums earned. Similar to the loss ratio, we expect that this ratio will be more volatile for our severity business depending on loss activity in any particular period.









	The combined ratio is the sum of the composite ratio and the underwriting expense ratio. The combined ratio measures the total profitability of our underwriting operations and does not take into account corporate expenses, net investment income or any foreign exchange gain or loss. Given the nature of our unique underwriting strategy, we expect that our combined ratio may also be volatile from period to period.













	Financial Condition

	Our long investments and financial contracts receivable reported in the

	March 31, 2017


	, were


	$1,240.2 million


	, compared to


	$1,098.9 million


	 as of


	December 31, 2016

	The significant changes in our long investments and financial contracts receivable for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 were as follows:

	Explanation








	$(18.4)






	 






	Commodities - Gold






	 






	Decrease primarily due to the reduction of physical gold holdings.








	$(38.1)






	 






	Financial contracts receivable

	Equities - Listed






	 






	Increase primarily due to acquisition of equity securities.








	$(14.4)






	 






	Corporate debt






	 






	Decrease due to disposal of certain corporate debt instruments.















	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, our exposure to long investments decreased to


	95.3%


	, compared to


	99.5%


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	. This exposure analysis is conducted on a delta-adjusted basis and excludes macro positions which consist of CDS, interest rate swaps, sovereign debt, currencies, commodities, volatility indexes and derivatives on any of these instruments. Therefore a change in the exposure may not directly translate into a corresponding change in the long investments.




	 




	Financial contracts payable as of


	March 31, 2017


	 increased by


	$1.0 million


	, or


	43.7%


	, compared to


	December 31, 2016


	, primarily due to a total return equity swaps that depreciated in value and were reclassified from financial contracts receivable to financial contracts payable as of


	March 31, 2017


	.









	From time to time, we incur indebtedness to our prime brokers to implement our investment strategy in accordance with our investment guidelines. Additionally, under term margin agreements we pledge certain investment securities to borrow cash from prime brokers in order to provide collateral for trust accounts and for some of our letters of credit outstanding. The borrowed amount is held in accounts for the benefit of the beneficiaries and is included in the restricted cash and cash equivalents balance on the


	condensed consolidated


	 balance sheet. As of 


	March 31, 2017


	, we had borrowed


	$558.8 million


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$319.8 million


	) from our prime brokers for investing activities (including short positions) and to provide collateral for trust accounts and letters of credit. The increase in the amount borrowed from prime brokers was partially a result of the higher level of margin borrowing required for the current composition of the investment portfolio as of


	March 31, 2017


	 and partially a result of the increase in collateral provided to our cedents in the form of trusts and letters of credit.









	In accordance with Greenlight Re’s investment guidelines in effect as of


	March 31, 2017


	, DME Advisors may employ up to 15% (GRIL: 5%) net margin leverage for extended periods of time and up to 30% (GRIL: 20%) net margin leverage relating to investing activities for periods of less than 30 days.




	 




	Our investment portfolio, including any derivatives, is valued at fair value and any unrealized gains or losses are reflected in net investment income (loss) in the


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of income. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, 


	91.8%


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	88.3%


	) of our investment portfolio (excluding restricted and unrestricted cash and cash equivalents) was comprised of investments valued based on quoted prices in actively traded markets (Level 1), 


	7.2%


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	10.7%


	) was comprised of securities valued based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2) and 


	0.3%


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	0.7%


	) was comprised of securities valued based on non-observable inputs (Level 3). As of


	March 31, 2017


	,


	0.7%


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	0.3%


	) of our investment portfolio was comprised of private equity funds valued using the funds’ net asset values as a practical expedient. (Refer to Note 3 “Financial Instruments” in the


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements for details of transfers into and out of Level 3 during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	).




	 




	In determining whether a market for a financial instrument is active or inactive, we obtain information from DME Advisors, based on feedback it receives from executing brokers, market makers, analysts and traders to assess the level of market activity and available liquidity for any given financial instrument. Where a financial instrument is valued based on broker quotes, DME Advisors requests multiple quotes. The ultimate value is based on an average of the quotes obtained. Broker quoted prices are generally not adjusted in determining the ultimate values and are obtained with the expectation of the quotes being binding. As of


	March 31, 2017


	,


	$112.0 million


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$140.1 million


	) of our investments (longs, shorts and derivatives) were valued based on broker quotes, of which


	$111.3 million


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$137.6 million


	) were based on broker quotes that utilized observable market information and classified as Level 2 fair value measurements, and

	million


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$2.4 million


	) were based on broker quotes that utilized non-observable inputs and classified as Level 3 fair value measurements.




	 




	Non-observable inputs used by our investment advisor include the use of investment manager statements and management estimates based on third party appraisals of underlying assets for valuing private equity investments. 









	Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased; Restricted Cash and Cash Equivalents









	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, our securities sold, not yet purchased, were


	$867.7 million


	, compared to


	$859.9 million


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	. However, the short exposure decreased to


	68.0%


	 as of


	March 31, 2017


	, compared to


	72.9%


	 at


	December 31, 2016


	, primarily due to the increase in assets under management by our investment advisor. The exposure analysis is conducted on a delta-adjusted basis and excludes macro positions which consist of CDS, interest rate swaps, sovereign debt, currencies, commodities, volatility indexes and derivatives on any of these instruments. Therefore a change in the exposure may not directly translate into a corresponding change in the securities sold, not yet purchased.









	Unlike long investments, short sales theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since there is no limit as to how high the market price of a security may rise. While it is not possible to list all of the reasons why a loss on a short sale may occur, a loss on a short sale may be caused by one or more of the following factors:


















	•






	Fluctuations in the share price due to an overall positive investment market;
















	•






	Sudden unexpected changes in the underlying business model of the issuer;
















	•






	Changes in laws and regulations relating to short sales;
















	•






	Press releases and earnings guidance issued by the issuer;
















	•






	A merger or acquisition of the issuer at a price in excess of the current share price;
















	•






	The shares of the issuer becoming difficult to borrow; or
















	•






	A short squeeze.












	Given the various scenarios under which a loss may occur on a short sale, it is not possible to quantify the risk and uncertainty of loss relating to short sales. However, DME Advisors typically performs a detailed analysis prior to entering into a short sale. Thereafter, the investment is routinely monitored by DME Advisors. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, Greenlight Re’s investment guidelines limit any single investment from constituting more than 20% of the portfolio (10% for GRIL’s portfolio) at any given time, which limits the potential adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position from any one position.









	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, restricted cash included


	$867.7 million


	 relating to collateral for securities sold, not yet purchased, compared to


	$859.9 million


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	.









	Overall, our restricted cash


	increased


	 by


	$141.4 million


	, or


	11.8%


	, from


	$1,202.7 million


	 to


	$1,344.1 million


	, partially due to the increase in collateral posted for our reinsurance obligations to our clients which increased by


	$114.4 million


	 during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	. To a lesser extent, the increase in restricted cash was caused by an increase in swap counterparty collateral, which


	increased


	 by


	$19.2 million


	, during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	.




	 




	Reinsurance Balances Receivable; Deferred Acquisition Costs, Net; Unearned Premium Reserves




	 




	At


	March 31, 2017


	, reinsurance balances receivable were


	$268.4 million


	, compared to


	$219.1 million


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	,


	an increase


	 of


	$49.3 million


	, or


	22.5%


	. The increase in reinsurance balances receivable was primarily attributable to premiums on contracts currently in force including net premiums held by ceding insurers on certain deals that allow for funds to be withheld by the ceding insurer. At


	March 31, 2017


	, funds withheld were $46.1 million, compared to $28.4 million as of


	December 31, 2016


	. We believe the reinsurance balances receivable are fully collectible and no allowance for bad debt was considered necessary at


	March 31, 2017


	.









	At


	March 31, 2017


	, deferred acquisition costs (net of retrocession)


	increased


	 by


	$12.4 million


	, or


	20.4%


	, compared to


	December 31, 2016


	. The increase was consistent with and related to the increase in unearned premium reserves during the same period. We evaluate the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs by determining if the sum of future earned premiums and anticipated investment income is greater than the expected future claims and expenses. If a loss is probable on the unexpired portion of policies in force, a premium deficiency loss is recognized. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we believe that the deferred acquisition costs were fully recoverable and no premium deficiency loss was recorded.

	During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, the frequency loss reserves increased by


	$32.6 million


	, or


	12.3%


	, to


	$297.5 million


	 from


	$264.8 million


	 as of


	December 31, 2016


	. The increases in both case reserves and IBNR were primarily related to the premiums earned during the period on active frequency contracts.









	The severity loss reserves increased by


	$0.7 million


	, or


	1.8%


	, primarily relating to case reserves.









	 For most of our contracts written as of


	March 31, 2017


	, our risk exposure is limited by defined limits of liability. Once the loss limit for a contract has been reached, we have no further exposure to additional losses from that contract. However, certain contracts, particularly quota share contracts that relate to first dollar exposure, may not contain aggregate limits. Our severity business, and to a lesser extent our frequency business, include certain contracts that contain or may contain natural peril loss exposure. As of


	April 1, 2017


	, our maximum aggregate loss exposure to any series of natural peril events was


	$229.9 million


	. For purposes of the preceding sentence, aggregate loss exposure is net of any retrocession (including any ILWs) and is equal to the difference between the aggregate limits available in the contracts that contain natural peril exposure minus reinstatement premiums, if any, for the same contracts. We categorize peak zones as: United States, Canada and the Caribbean; Europe; Japan; and the rest of the world. The following table provides single event loss exposure and aggregate loss exposure information for the peak zones of our natural peril coverage as of


	April 1, 2017

	Since our maximum loss exposures are theoretical maximums based on contract limits, these limits may be significantly higher than modeled loss estimates which are commonly used in the insurance industry. Therefore, we also estimate catastrophe losses in terms of the probable maximum loss (“PML”). We define PML as the anticipated loss, taking into account contract terms and limits, caused by a catastrophe affecting a broad geographic area, such as that caused by an earthquake or hurricane. We anticipate that the PML will vary depending upon the modeled simulated losses and the composition of the in-force book of business. The projected severity levels are described in terms of a 1-in-250 year return period. The 1-in-250 year return period PML means that there is a 0.4% chance in any given year that an occurrence of a natural catastrophe will lead to losses exceeding the stated estimate. In other words, it corresponds to a 99.6% probability that the loss from an event will fall below the indicated PML.









	PMLs are estimates and as a result, we cannot provide any assurance that any actual event will align with the modeled event or that actual losses from events similar to the modeled events will not vary materially from the modeled event PML. The PML estimate includes all significant exposure from our reinsurance operations. This includes coverage for property, motor, marine, energy, aviation and workers’ compensation.

	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	General









	Greenlight Capital Re is organized as a holding company with no operations of its own. As a holding company, Greenlight Capital Re has minimal continuing cash needs, most of which are related to the payment of administrative expenses. All of our underwriting operations are conducted through our wholly-owned reinsurance subsidiaries, Greenlight Re and GRIL, which underwrite property and casualty reinsurance. There are restrictions on each of Greenlight Re’s and GRIL’s ability to pay dividends, which are described in more detail below. It is our current policy to retain earnings to support the growth of our business. We currently do not expect to pay dividends on our ordinary shares.









	As of 


	March 31, 2017


	, Greenlight Re and GRIL were each rated “A- (Excellent)” with a stable outlook, by A.M. Best. The ratings reflect A.M. Best’s opinion of our reinsurance subsidiaries’ financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet obligations and it is not an evaluation directed toward the protection of investors or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our Class A ordinary shares. If A.M. Best downgrades our ratings below “A- (Excellent)” or withdraws our rating, we could be severely limited or prevented from writing any new reinsurance contracts, which would significantly and negatively affect our business. Our A.M. Best ratings may be revised or revoked at the sole discretion of the rating agency. 









	Sources and Uses of Funds




	 




	Our sources of funds consist primarily of premium receipts (net of brokerage and ceding commissions), investment income (net of advisory compensation and investment expenses), including realized gains, and other income. We use cash from our operations to pay losses and loss adjustment expenses, profit commissions and general and administrative expenses. Substantially all of our funds, including shareholders’ capital, net of funds required for business operations, are invested by DME Advisors in accordance with our investment guidelines. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, approximately 


	95%


	 (December 31,


	2016


	:


	94%


	) of our long investments were comprised of publicly-traded equity securities and other holdings, which can be readily liquidated to meet current and future liabilities. Given our value-oriented long and short investment strategy, if markets are distressed, we would expect the liability of the short portfolio to decline. Any reduction in the liability would cause our need for restricted cash to decrease and thereby free up cash to be used for any purpose. Additionally, since the majority of our invested assets can be readily liquidated, even in distressed markets, we believe sufficient securities can be readily sold or covered in a timely manner to generate cash to pay claims. Since we classify our investments as “trading,” we book all gains and losses (including unrealized gains and losses) on all our investments (including derivatives) as net investment income or loss in our


	condensed consolidated


	 statements of income for each reporting period.

	For the


	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016


	, the net cash provided by or (used in) operating activities was


	$15.4 million


	 and


	$(7.3) million


	, respectively. Included in the net cash used in operating activities were investment related expenses, such as investment advisor compensation, and net interest and dividend expenses of


	$7.0 million


	 and


	$7.5 million


	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016


	, respectively. Excluding the investment related expenses from the net cash from operating activities, the net cash primarily provided by (used in) our underwriting activities was


	$22.4 million


	 and


	$0.2 million


	 for the


	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016


	, respectively. Generally, in a given period if the premiums collected are sufficient to cover claim payments, we would generate cash from our underwriting activities. Due to the inherent nature of our underwriting portfolio, claims are often paid several months or even years after the premiums are collected. The cash generated from underwriting activities, however, may be volatile from period to period depending on the underwriting opportunities available.









	For the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, our investing activities used cash of


	$17.9 million


	 (


	2016


	: provided cash of


	$92.2 million


	), driven primarily by increase in restricted cash and cash equivalents compared to the same period in


	2016


	. Cash used for, or provided by, investing activities is net of any withdrawals from the joint venture by DME (


	nil


	 for


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	). There were no financing activities during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	 and


	2016


	.




	   




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we believe we have sufficient cash flow from operating and investing activities to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements. We expect that our operational needs for liquidity will be met by cash, funds generated from underwriting activities and investment income, including realized gains and the disposition of investment securities. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we had no plans to issue debt and expect to fund our operations for the next twelve months from operating cash flow. However, we cannot provide assurances that in the future we will not incur indebtedness to implement our business strategy, pay claims or make acquisitions.




	 




	Although GLRE is not subject to any significant legal prohibitions on the payment of dividends, Greenlight Re and GRIL are each subject to regulatory minimum capital requirements and regulatory constraints that affect their ability to pay dividends to us. In addition, any dividend payment would have to be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities prior to payment. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, Greenlight Re and GRIL both exceeded the regulatory minimum capital requirements. 









	Letters of Credit and Trust Arrangements




	 




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, neither Greenlight Re nor GRIL was licensed or admitted as a reinsurer in any jurisdiction other than the Cayman Islands and the European Economic Area, respectively. Because many jurisdictions do not permit domestic insurance companies to take credit on their statutory financial statements for loss recoveries or ceded unearned premiums unless appropriate measures are in place for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non-admitted insurers, we anticipate that all of our U.S. clients and some of our non-U.S. clients will require us to provide collateral through funds withheld, trust arrangements, letters of credit or a combination thereof.









	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we had


	three


	 letter of credit facilities available with an aggregate capacity of


	$600.0 million


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$600.0 million


	) with various financial institutions. See Note


	9


	 of the accompanying


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements for details on each of the available facilities. We provide collateral to cedents in the form of letters of credit and trust arrangements. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, the aggregate amount of collateral provided to cedents under such arrangements was


	$457.0 million


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$341.7 million


	). The letters of credit and trust accounts are secured by equity and debt securities as well as cash and cash equivalents with a total fair value of


	$470.4 million


	 as of


	March 31, 2017


	 (


	December 31, 2016


	:


	$397.2 million


	).









	Each of the letter of credit facilities contain customary events of default and restrictive covenants, including but not limited to, limitations on liens on collateral, transactions with affiliates, mergers and sales of assets, as well as solvency and maintenance of certain minimum pledged equity requirements, and restricts issuance of any debt without the consent of the letter of credit provider. Additionally, if an event of default exists, as defined in the letter of credit facilities, Greenlight Re would be prohibited from paying dividends to its parent company. The Company was in compliance with all the covenants of each of these facilities as of


	March 31, 2017


	.

	Capital




	 




	Our capital structure currently consists entirely of equity issued in two separate classes of ordinary shares. We expect that the existing capital base and internally generated funds will be sufficient to implement our business strategy for the foreseeable future. Consequently, we do not presently anticipate that we will incur any material indebtedness in the ordinary course of our business other than temporary borrowing directly related to the management of our investment portfolio. However, in order to provide us with flexibility and timely access to public capital markets should we require additional capital for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purposes, we have filed a Form S-3 registration statement, which expires in June 2018 unless renewed. We did not make any significant commitments for capital expenditures during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	.









	Our Board of Directors has adopted a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to repurchase up to


	2.0 million


	 Class A ordinary shares or securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. The current share repurchase plan expires on June 30, 2017 unless renewed by the Board of Directors. As of


	March 31, 2017


	,


	2.0 million


	 Class A ordinary shares remained authorized for repurchase under the repurchase plan. The Company is not required to repurchase any of the Class A ordinary shares and the repurchase plan may be modified, suspended or terminated at the election of our Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. During the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	,


	no


	 Class A ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company.









	As of 


	March 31, 2017


	, there were


	345,592


	 Class A ordinary shares available for future issuance under the Company’s stock incentive plan. On April 26, 2017, our shareholders approved an amendment to our stock incentive plan to increase the number of Class A ordinary shares available for issuance from 3.5 million to 5.0 million. The stock incentive plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.

	 As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we had made total commitments of


	$25.3 million


	 in private investments of which we had invested


	$17.3 million


	, and our remaining commitments to these investments total


	$8.0 million


	. Given the nature of private equity commitments, we are unable to determine with any degree of accuracy as to when the commitments will be called. As such, for the purposes of the above table, we have assumed that all commitments with no fixed payment schedule will be made within one year. Under our investment guidelines, in effect as of the date hereof, no more than 10% of the assets in the investment portfolio may be held in private equity securities without specific approval from the Board of Directors.  





	(3)



	    Due to the nature of our reinsurance operations, the amount and timing of the cash flows associated with our reinsurance contractual liabilities will fluctuate, perhaps materially, and, therefore, are highly uncertain.









	As of


	March 31, 2017


	,


	$867.7 million


	 of securities sold, not yet purchased, were secured by


	$867.7 million


	 of restricted cash held by prime brokers to cover obligations relating to securities sold, not yet purchased. These amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above because there is no maturity date for securities sold, not yet purchased, and their maturities are not set by any contract and as such their due dates cannot be estimated.




	 




	Greenlight Re has entered into lease agreements for office space in the Cayman Islands. The leases expire on June 30, 2018 and Greenlight Re has the option to renew the leases for a further five year term.

	The Company and its reinsurance subsidiaries are party to a joint venture agreement with DME Advisors and a separate investment advisory agreement with DME. Effective January 1, 2017, the venture agreement and the advisory agreement were amended and restated to replace the previous agreements dated January 1, 2014, and will expire on


	December 31, 2019


	 and renew automatically for successive three-year periods.









	Pursuant to the venture agreement, we pay DME Advisors a monthly management fee of 0.125% on our share of the assets managed by DME Advisors and we provide DME a performance allocation equal to 20% of the net profit, calculated per annum, of the Company’s share of the capital account managed by DME Advisors, subject to a loss carry forward provision. The loss carry forward provision allows DME to earn a reduced performance allocation of 10% of profits in any year subsequent to the year in which the investment account incurs a loss, until all the losses are recouped and an additional amount equal to 150% of the aggregate investment loss is earned. DME is not entitled to earn a performance allocation in a year in which the investment portfolio incurs a loss. For the


	three months ended March 31, 2017


	, performance allocation of


	$1.2 million


	 and management fees of


	$4.3 million


	 were included in net investment income.




	 




	We have entered into a service agreement with DME Advisors pursuant to which DME Advisors will provide investor relations services to us for compensation of


	$5,000


	 per month plus expenses. The service agreement had an initial term of one year, and continues for sequential one-year periods until terminated by us or DME Advisors. Either party may terminate the service agreement for any reason with 30 days prior written notice to the other party.

	Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements




	 




	We have no obligations, assets or liabilities, other than those derivatives in our investment portfolio that are disclosed in the


	condensed consolidated


	 financial statements, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. 









	Effects of Inflation




	 




	We consider the effects of inflation in our pricing and when estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The actual effects of inflation on our results of operations cannot be accurately known until claims are ultimately settled. For the


	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016


	, inflation had no significant impact on our revenues or net income. We do not believe that inflation has had or will have a material effect on our combined results of operations, except insofar as inflation may affect interest rates and the asset values in our investment portfolio.

	Equity Price Risk




	As of


	March 31, 2017


	, our investment portfolio consisted of long and short equity securities, along with certain equity-based derivative instruments, the carrying values of which are primarily based on quoted market prices. Generally, market prices of common equity securities are subject to fluctuation, which could cause the amount to be realized upon the closing of the position to differ significantly from their current reported value. This risk is partly mitigated by the presence of both long and short equity securities within our investment portfolio. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, a 10% decline in the price of each of these listed equity securities and equity-based derivative instruments would result in a


	$28.6 million


	, or


	2.4%


	, decline in the fair value of our total investment portfolio.




	 




	Computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical equity price changes are based on numerous assumptions, including the maintenance of the existing level and composition of investment securities and should not be relied on as indicative of future results.









	Commodity Price Risk




	Generally, market prices of commodities are subject to fluctuation. Our investment portfolio periodically includes long or short investments in commodities or in derivatives directly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of commodities. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, our investment portfolio included unhedged exposure to changes in gold prices, through ownership of physical gold and derivative instruments with underlying exposure to changes in gold prices. Additionally, as of


	March 31, 2017


	, our investment portfolio included derivative instruments with underlying exposure to changes in natural gas and oil prices.




	The following table summarizes the net impact that a 10% increase and decrease in commodity prices would have on the value of our investment portfolio as of


	March 31, 2017


	. The below table excludes the indirect effect that changes in commodity prices might have on equity securities in our investment portfolio.

	We, along with our investment advisor, periodically monitor our exposure to any other commodity price fluctuations and generally do not expect changes in other commodity prices to have a materially adverse impact on our operations.




	 




	Foreign Currency Risk




	Certain of our reinsurance contracts provide that ultimate losses may be payable or calculated in foreign currencies depending on the country of original loss. Foreign currency exchange rate risk exists to the extent that our foreign currency loss reserves (case reserves and IBNR) are in excess of the corresponding foreign currency cash balances and there is an increase in the exchange rate of that foreign currency. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, we had a net unhedged foreign currency exposure on GBP denominated loss reserves of


	£(0.1) million


	. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, a 10% decrease in the U.S. dollar against the GBP (all else being constant) would result in additional estimated loss reserves of


	$0.0 million


	 and a corresponding foreign exchange loss. Alternatively, a 10% increase in the U.S dollar against the GBP, would result in a reduction of


	$0.0 million


	 in our recorded loss reserves and a corresponding foreign exchange gain.




	 




	While we do not seek to specifically match our liabilities under reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies with investments denominated in such currencies, we continually monitor our exposure to potential foreign currency losses and may use foreign currency cash and cash equivalents or forward foreign currency exchange contracts in an effort to mitigate against adverse foreign currency movements.

	We are also exposed to foreign currency risk through cash, forwards, options and investments in securities denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the potential for adverse changes in the U.S. dollar value of investments (long and short), speculative foreign currency options and cash positions due to a change in the exchange rate of the foreign currency in which cash and financial instruments are denominated. As of


	March 31, 2017


	, some of our currency exposure resulting from foreign denominated securities (longs and shorts) was reduced by offsetting cash balances denominated in the corresponding foreign currencies. 









	The following table summarizes the net impact that a 10% increase and decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar against select foreign currencies would have on the value of our investment portfolio as of


	March 31, 2017

	Interest Rate Risk




	Our investment portfolio includes interest rate sensitive securities, such as corporate and sovereign debt instruments and interest rate options. The primary market risk exposure for any debt instrument is interest rate risk. As interest rates rise, the market value of our long fixed-income portfolio falls, and the opposite is also true as interest rates fall. Additionally, some of our derivative investments may also be sensitive to interest rates and their value may indirectly fluctuate with changes in interest rates. 









	The following table summarizes the impact that a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio as of


	March 31, 2017


	:

	For the purposes of the above table, the hypothetical impact of changes in interest rates on debt instruments was determined based on the interest rates applicable to each instrument individually. We periodically monitor our net exposure to interest rate risk and generally do not expect changes in interest rates to have a materially adverse impact on our operations.

	Credit Risk









	We are exposed to credit risk primarily from the possibility that counterparties may default on their obligations to us. The amount of the maximum exposure to credit risk is indicated by the carrying value of our financial assets including notes receivable. We evaluate the financial condition of our notes receivable counterparties and monitor our exposure to them on a regular basis. We are also exposed to credit risk from our business partners and clients relating to balances receivable under the reinsurance contracts, including premiums receivable, losses recoverable and commission adjustments recoverable. We monitor the collectability of these balances on a regular basis.









	In addition, the securities, commodities, and cash in our investment portfolio are held with several prime brokers, subjecting us to the related credit risk from the possibility that one or more of them may default on their obligations to us. We closely and regularly monitor our concentration of credit risk with each prime broker and, if necessary, transfer cash or securities between prime brokers to diversify and mitigate our credit risk. Other than our investment in derivative contracts and corporate debt, if any, and the fact that our investments and majority of cash balances are held by prime brokers on our behalf, we have no other significant concentrations of credit risk. 









	Political Risk









	We are exposed to political risk to the extent that we underwrite business from entities located in foreign markets and to the extent that DME Advisors, on our behalf and subject to our investment guidelines, trades securities that are listed on various U.S. and foreign exchanges and markets. The governments in any of these jurisdictions could impose restrictions, regulations or other measures, which may have a material adverse impact on our underwriting operations and investment strategy. We currently do not write political risk coverage on our insurance contracts; however, changes in government laws and regulations may impact our underwriting operations (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended


	December 31, 2016


	).










	 










	Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES




	 




	Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	 




	As required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, the Company has evaluated, with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in such rules) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all frauds. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.




	 




	Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	 




	There have been no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended


	March 31, 2017


	 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to review its disclosure controls and procedures, including its internal controls over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that the Company’s systems evolve with its business.











	  










	PART II — OTHER INFORMATION




	 










	Item 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS




	 




	From time to time, in the normal course of business, we may be involved in formal and informal dispute resolution procedures, which may include arbitration or litigation, the outcomes of which determine our rights and obligations under our reinsurance contracts and other contractual agreements. In some disputes, we may seek to enforce our rights under an agreement or to collect funds owing to us. In other matters, we may resist attempts by others to collect funds or enforce alleged rights. While the final outcome of legal disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that any of our existing contractual disputes, when finally resolved, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.





	 










	Item 1A. RISK FACTORS




	 




	Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in Item 1A “Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended


	December 31, 2016


	 as filed with the SEC. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.




	 




	As of 


	March 31, 2017


	, there have been no other material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended


	December 31, 2016


	 as filed with the SEC. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.










	 










	Item 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 




	 




	Our board of directors has adopted a share repurchase plan authorizing the Company to repurchase Class A ordinary shares. On April 26, 2017, our Board of Directors amended the share repurchase plan to extend the duration of the repurchase plan to June 30, 2018 and reinstated the authorization for the Company to purchase up to


	2.0 million


	 Class A ordinary shares or securities convertible into Class A ordinary shares in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions or Rule 10b5-1 stock trading plans. As of


	March 31, 2017


	,


	2.0 million


	 Class A ordinary shares remained authorized for repurchase under the repurchase plan. No Class A ordinary shares were repurchased by the Company during the three months ended


	March 31, 2017

	RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES AND PREFERRED SHARE DIVIDENDS




	 




	 




	The following table sets forth our consolidated ratios:




	 























	 






	Three months ended March 31, 2017






	 






	Three months ended March 31, 2016

	Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges (1)






	16.49






	 






	13.87















	(1) The ratio of earnings to fixed charges was determined by dividing consolidated earnings by total fixed charges. For purposes of the ratios of earnings to fixed charges (i) earnings consist of consolidated net income before considering income taxes, minority interest and fixed charges and (ii) fixed charges consist of interest on indebtedness, interest expense on funds withheld from reinsurers and that portion of rent expense that is deemed by our management to be an appropriate interest factor. We have estimated that one-third of rent expense represents a reasonable approximation of the interest factor.




	 




	(2) No preferred shares were outstanding during the


	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016


	, and no preferred share dividends were paid during those periods.
