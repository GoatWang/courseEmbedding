CBAM machines and parts services offer industrial strength 3D printed parts. Impossible Objects brings the power of 3D printing from prototyping through high-volume production.


Our composite-based additive manufacturing technology – CBAM – delivers stronger parts, at faster speeds and from a wider range of materials. CBAM can replace expensive, time-consuming conventional techniques like machining, tooling, and injection molding, while offering greater geometric complexity.
CBAM’s completely new approach to 3D printing makes parts from fiber-reinforced composites, such as carbon, Kevlar and glass fiber fabrics bonded with thermoplastic matrix materials, ranging from nylon/polyamide to polyethylene, PEEK, and more. These strong, lightweight composite parts are in high demand, saving energy, reducing environmental impact, and enhancing user experiences. CBAM makes functional parts and tools that have enormous advantage in the automotive, aerospace, electronics, defense, athletics, industrial, and medical device industries.




CBAM Machines
With CBAM machines, users go directly from CAD models to build blocks of fiber-reinforced materials, with no tooling and minimal touch labor. Fiber fabrics and thermoplastic powders are automatically combined in a system to rapidly produce strong, lightweight 3D parts. The parts in a single build operation can all be the same or different, and the process is completed with simple heating and finishing steps. Our customers have applications in which CBAM produces parts more competitively than conventional manufacturing processes. If you are interested in our machine products please contact us at machines@impossible-objects.com.



CBAM Parts
We make parts for customers who want high-strength, functional parts or who want to understand the capabilities of the CBAM process. Whether you need a single part or many, it’s easy to get started. For a quote or other information, simply send your CAD model and contact information to us at parts@impossible-objects.com.

About - Impossible Objects




























































































Search
















We are a science-driven company pioneering advancements in the additive manufacturing and composites manufacturing industries. Based on years of research and development, our composite-based additive manufacturing technology (CBAM) is an entirely new process that is fundamentally different from conventional additive manufacturing technologies.
CBAM is designed specifically for composites. It produces parts stronger than other additive manufacturing technologies, faster than traditional composite methods and with more design freedom, and has a broader selection of materials, including carbon fiber, Kevlar and fiberglass. And we’re just getting started. Our goal is to produce the world’s strongest additively manufactured composite parts, rivaling hand layup materials, at injection molding speeds.
