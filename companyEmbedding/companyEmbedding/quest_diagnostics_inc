New York Giants training camp capsule











 





































NEW YORK GIANTS (11-6) OPEN CAMP: July 28, Quest Diagnostics Training Center, East Rutherford, New Jersey. LAST YEAR: Turnaround season in Ben McAdoo's first year as coach. Surprisingly, it was defense that carried team. S Landon Collins had MVP-type year in his second season. Additions of DE Olivier Vernon and DT Damon Harrison and return of DE Jason Pierre-Paul to form after 2015 fireworks accident transformed Steve Spagnuolo's unit. Offense, which led team in 2015 with McAdoo as coordinator, was major disappointment. Two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning was under too much pressure and there was no running game to help. Giants won close games: New York had eight wins by seven points or less. Its biggest winning margin was 14. Only time it was blown out was in wild-card game by Packers, game overshadowed by Odell Beckham Jr. and other receivers taking ill-advised boating trip in Florida on off day during week before contest game. General manager Jerry Reese told Beckham to start maturing in season-ending interviews. IMPORTANT ADDITIONS: WR Brandon Marshall, rookie TE Evan Engram, OL D.J. Fluker, rookie DT Dalvin Tomlinson, PK Aldrick Rosas. IMPORTANT LOSSES: DT Johnathan Hankins, PK Robbie Gould, RT Marshall Newhouse, WR Victor Cruz, RB Rashad Jennings. CAMP NEEDS: While defense went from one of NFL's worst to very good unit, offense went downhill. Line was bad, running game was nonexistent, and Manning rarely had third option at receiver outside of Beckham and Sterling Shepard. With exception of Newhouse, line returns. Entering third season, LT Ereck Flowers has to start playing like first-round pick. Either Bobby Hart or Fluker will replace Newhouse. Hope is fleet Engram proves difficult matchup at tight end, and Marshall gives Manning third option. Second-year pro Paul Perkins expected to replace Jennings. Spagnuolo needs to find safety (Darian Thompson, Andrew Adams) to play opposite Collins, and DT (Tomlinson, Jay Bromley) to play beside All-Pro Harrison. Rosas has big leg but he has never kicked in regular-season game. Will Giants go fishing for veteran on waiver wire after final cutdown? EXPECTATIONS: If defense plays as well as last year and offense returns to 2015 form, Giants can challenge Cowboys in NFC East. New York should make  playoffs for second straight year after missing five in row. --- AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP-NFL © 2017 The Associated Press.  All rights reserved.

Quest Diagnostics Closes Deal to Acquire 2 Labs in Texas

 Well ahead of the expected time of completion, Quest Diagnostics DGX  closed the earlier-announced deal to acquire two laboratory businesses in Lewisville, TX, namely, Med Fusion and Clear Point. This is in line with the company's plan to fast expand in the high-growth cancer diagnostic market. The businesses jointly provide a complete range of diagnostic services to physicians and provider networks. This acquisition will allow Quest Diagnostics to establish a center of excellence to provide diagnostic services for the detection and management of cancer.  Baylor Scott & White Health (BSWH), The US Oncology Network or the Network (supported by McKesson Specialty Health), Texas Oncology and Pathologists Bio-Medical Laboratories (PBM) are co-owners of one or both the businesses.    Quest Diagnostics will team up with McKesson Specialty Health, The Network and Texas Oncology to enhance Med Fusion's model, which has been created to standardize next-generation gene sequencing panels to help in selecting the therapy and monitoring of cancer. After completion of the deal, Quest Diagnostics is now a preferred provider of advanced oncology diagnostics for The Network and Texas Oncology. Primarily, Quest Diagnostics will offer services to 12 BSWH hospitals in North Texas and 400 independent, community-based physicians nationally that are affiliated with The Network, including Texas Oncology. We believe that the deal is perfectly aligned with Quest Diagnostics' goal to capture the high-potential global oncology diagnostic market. On account of the data provided by American Cancer Society, nearly 1.7 million people are likely to be diagnosed with cancer in the U.S. in 2017. In this regard, Quest Diagnostics is taking strategic steps to capture the market. According to Markets and Markets, the global cancer diagnostics market is expected to reach a worth of $13.1 billion by 2020, and is poised to see a CAGR of 12.9% during the of 2015 to 2020 period. The company clearly has bountiful opportunities in this niche market. Over the last three months, Quest Diagnostics has been observed to outperform the Zacks categorized  Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare  industry. As per the latest share price movement, the company has gained 6.4%, as compared to the 5.7% gain of the broader industry.  Recent Developments  Recently, Quest Diagnostics announced plans to acquire the outreach laboratory services business of Cape Cod Healthcare (CCHC).  Notably, CCHC provides healthcare services to residents and visitors of Cape Cod.  The deal, if concluded, is expected to provide quality, affordable and convenient laboratory services to Cape Cod residents. Within its advanced diagnostics business, Quest Diagnostics, along with its onchology francise partner Memorial Sloan Kettering, has teamed up with IBM to form IBM Health Watson. With about 70% of the oncology prospects being in community healthcare centers instead of large urban centers, this is a huge opportunity for the companies.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks  Quest Diagnostics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks are Mesa Laboratories, Inc. MLAB  , INSYS Therapeutics, Inc. INSY  and Align Technology, Inc. ALGN  . Notably, INSYS Therapeutics sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Mesa Laboratories and Align Technology carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.   Mesa Laboratories has a positive earnings surprise of 2.84% for the last four quarters. The stock has added roughly 8.9% over the last three months. INSYS Therapeutics has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 20%. The stock has gained around 24.3% over the last three months.

Can Quest Diagnostics (DGX) Pull a Surprise in Q2 Earnings?


July 18, 2017, 10:34:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com









































Shutterstock photo


  Quest Diagnostics Inc. DGX  is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings results before the opening bell on Jul 25. Last quarter, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16 cents, delivering a positive earnings surprise of 13.68%. It is worth noting that Quest Diagnostics outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters at an average of 5.15%. Let's take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.  Factors at Play  Posing a threat to Quest Diagnostics' revenue per requisition performance, the last reported first-quarter 2017 saw a 20-basis points (bps) decrease in the same. Moreover, we remain apprehensive, as the company's two Professional Lab Services (PLS) engagement, WJ Barnabas Health and HealthONE System of HCA Holdings, Inc. (HCA) carry lower revenue per requisition due to the nature of work. This apart, unit price headwinds had  less than 100 bps in the first quarter. While unit price headwinds stayed in moderate ranges (at approximately 1%) over the last few years, the company continues to expect the same for 2017 too.  Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS   Surprise         Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Price and EPS   Surprise    |      Quest Diagnostics Incorporated Quote  Also, over the last two years, Quest Diagnostics faced several reimbursement issues that affected its revenues. The company is concerned about the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) proposal related to Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA). However, while reimbursement pressure has likely acted as an overhang on performance in the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects to beat the pressure through test and business mix. On a positive note, as observed in the reported first quarter of fiscal 2017, Quest Diagnostics seems to be determined to stimulate performance by adhering to its two-point growth strategy - Accelerate growth and Drive operational Excellence. We are also optimistic about the successful execution of the company's strategy to grow its esoteric testing business and drive profitable growth. Also, in the recent past, Quest Diagnostics witnessed significant growth through infectious disease testing, prescription drug monitoring and industry-leading wellness business. We expect these growth drivers to remain active through the second quarter as well, driving the same metrics as in the preceding quarter. We believe all these recent developments will significantly contribute to the company's top line in the second quarter. The company currently expects full-year 2017 revenues within the range of $7.64 billion to $7.72 billion (annualized growth of 2-3%). The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $7.69 billion, close to the low end of the company's guided range. In addition, the company's 2017 adjusted earnings per share have been forecasted between $5.45 and $5.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.56 is within this range.  Earnings Whispers  Our proven model does not conclusively show that Quest Diagnostics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive   Earnings ESP    and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.  Zacks ESP  : Quest Diagnostics has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.41 You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .  Zacks Rank  : Quest Diagnostics has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.  Stocks to Consider  Here are a few companies you may want to consider as our proven model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:   Becton, Dickinson and Company BDX  has an Earnings ESP of +0.41% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here   . Align Technology, Inc. ALGN  has an Earnings ESP of +4.11% and a Zacks Rank #2.

PITTSBURGH –  A former University of Pittsburgh medical researcher wants a new trial in the cyanide poisoning of his neurologist wife claiming, among other things, that a lab test confirming a lethal level of the poison in her blood was suspect.






Robert Ferrante's appeals brief filed in Superior Court on Wednesday was first reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which objected when the initial appeal was filed under seal in February. The court agreed the filing was in the public interest and last month ordered defense attorney Chris Rand Eyster to file a new brief within 14 days.
Ferrante, 68, is serving life in prison without parole after being convicted of first-degree murder in November 2014. Allegheny County prosecutors contend Ferrante killed Dr. Autumn Klein, 41, by putting cyanide in her energy drink in 2013, which text messages show he urged her to drink to enhance her fertility.
Klein collapsed and fell suddenly ill — she could be heard gasping for air in the background as Ferrante called 911 for an ambulance — on April 17, 2013. She died three days later.
Ferrante's attorney contests the reliability of Quest Diagnostics lab results that concluded Klein was poisoned. The defense also argues 89 search warrants were overly broad and the case lacked enough evidence to convict Ferrante.
"We believe that the claims being raised in the appeal have no merit," Mike Manko, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said Thursday.



Eyster filed the initial appeal brief under seal, arguing that it would violate an earlier court order protecting Quest's standard operating procedures from public view. Eyster was ordered to redact any such information in the new brief.
The defense attorney contends the prosecutor's office didn't reveal that a Quest subsidiary, the Nichols Institute, paid a $40 million fine for a 2009 federal misbranding conviction and $241 million more to settle related litigation. In that case, federal prosecutors contend Quest/Nichols sold misbranded tests to various laboratories that were unreliable in measuring parathyroid hormone levels in patients.
Eyster argued that information could have been used to impeach the credibility of the Quest results, which Ferrante's previous defense attorney repeatedly attacked at trial.
"The cause of death determination depended on whether the Quest result was reliable," Eyster wrote.
Ferrante and his trial attorneys argued Klein suffered cardiac arrhythmia or some kind of brain abnormality relating to headaches and fainting spells she had suffered in the previous months. They acknowledged he ordered cyanide in the weeks before her death, but said Ferrante, who was a well-known researcher into Lou Gehrig's disease, used the poison to mimic the disease's symptoms in lab animals.
Prosecutors focused on evidence suggesting Klein was pressuring Ferrante to have another child, which they contend he didn't want. The couple, married in 2001, had a 6-year-old daughter when Klein died, and prosecutors noted Ferrante had texted Klein to suggest the energy drink might help them conceive.
Other testimony showed someone used Ferrante's computers to search for information on cyanide poisoning in the weeks before Klein died and, after she died but before he was arrested, on how a coroner might detect the poison.
An autopsy didn't detect the cyanide, but Quest's post-mortem test on Klein's blood — which had been drawn to treat her while she was still alive — showed lethal levels of the poison.

Acid-fast bacterium detection and identification from paraffin-embedded tissues using a PCR-pyrosequencing method 

 







Jian R Bao, Richard B Clark, Ronald N Master, Kileen L Shier, Lynn L EklundDepartment of Microbiology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute Chantilly, Chantilly, Virginia, USACorrespondence to Dr Richard B Clark, Department of Microbiology, Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute Chantilly, Chantilly, Virginia 20151, USA; richard.b.clark{at}questdiagnostics.com 



 



AbstractAims Acid-fast bacterium (AFB) identification from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues is challenging and may not be readily available to the clinical laboratory. A method to detect and identify AFB from FFPE tissues using PCR and pyrosequencing (PCR-Seq) was developed and evaluated.Methods The method was validated using spiked cell-clotted paraffin blocks before use with patients’ specimens. DNA was extracted from tissue sections, and a 16S rRNA gene fragment was amplified and a signature sequence was produced on a PyroMark ID system. Sequences were aligned to established databases for AFB identification. Additional tissue sections were stained and examined for AFB.Results Both sensitivity and specificity were 100% on spiked cell-clotted blocks without cross-reactivity with non-AFB. Of 302 FFPE tissues from patients, 116 (38%) were AFB-stain positive; 83 (72%) of these had AFB identified. The 21 AFB identified included Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (14 cases), Mycobacterium leprae (3), Mycobacterium genavense (2), Mycobacterium marinum-ulcerans group (3) and 17 other AFB (61). Thirteen cases were AFB-stain indeterminate and 4 were positive by the PCR-Seq method. Of the AFB stain-negative cases, 167 were negative and 6 were positive by PCR-Seq.Conclusions The PCR-Seq method provided specific identification of various AFB species or complexes from FFPE tissues.paraffin-embedded tissueacid-fast bacterial identificationPCR-sequencing

Giants 2017 Positional Breakdown: Special Teams

With New York Giants training camp beginning in late July, BigBlueInteractive.com (BBI) breaks down each of the team’s positional groups until the players report at Quest Diagnostics Training Center.
FIND A COMPLETE LIST OF ALL BREAKDOWNS HERE
POSITIONAL BREAKDOWN: Special Teams

2016 YEAR IN REVIEW: The Giants place-kicking situation was upended midway through 2016 when super-steady Josh Brown – who had made over 91 percent of his field goal attempts since joining the Giants in 2013 – was unceremoniously cut due to significant off-the-field issues. The Giants replaced him with long-time Chicago Bear Robbie Gould who was a perfect 10-of-10 on field goal attempts in 10 regular-season games.
Punter Brad Wing had a strong season in 2016, averaging 46.2 yards per punt (40.9 yard net). He had 28 kicks downed inside the 20-yard line. Wing was also named “NFC Special Teams Player of the Week” twice.
In his second year with the Giants, Dwayne Harris suffered through a frustrating, injury-plagued season. While he played in all 16 regular-season games, Harris was hampered by a variety of nagging injuries all season. His special teams return numbers plummeted with his punt return average falling from 10.0 yards to 5.9 yards and his kickoff return average falling from 28.7 yards to 24.2 yards. He also did not score a year after becoming the first Giants player in 60 years to return a kickoff and punt for a touchdown in the same season in 2015. Harris did remain a force on punt coverage and he was voted to his first Pro Bowl. With Harris ailing, Bobby Rainey (six punt and eight kickoff returns) and Odell Beckham, Jr. (10 punt returns) shared return duties.
Overall, the Giants finished 2016 7th in kickoff return average (23.8 yards per return) and 29th in punt return average (6.1 yards per return). On the flip side, the Giants were 23rd in covering kickoffs (22.8 yards per return) and 19th in covering punts (8.9 yards per return). The Giants neither scored nor allowed touchdowns on returns, but the Giants did return a blocked field goal attempt for a touchdown.
ADDITIONS/SUBTRACTIONS: Robbie Gould signed a 2-year contract with the San Francisco 49ers in March. Place kicker Aldrick Rosas was signed by the Giants to a reserve/future contract in January 2017. Rosas was originally signed as an undrafted rookie free agent by the Tennessee Titans after the 2016 NFL Draft, but he did not make the team.
TRAINING CAMP STORY LINES: On special teams, the story clearly is the unknown and unproven 22-year old Aldrick Rosas. Currently, Rosas is facing no competition for the job. Games and seasons often come down to field goal kicks. Indeed, Rosas may be THE most important player to follow in the preseason.
A secondary story line is whether or not Dwayne Harris can rebound from a disappointing and injury-plagued 2016 season. Harris is due to make $2.475 million salary in 2017 and $3.225 million in 2018 and 2019. He needs to justify those high salary figures.
ON THE BUBBLE: Even though he is currently facing no veteran competition, clearly Aldrick Rosas is on the hot seat. A discarded veteran kicker could be added at any time.
FROM THE POSITIONAL COACH: Tom Quinn on Aldrick Rosas: “Aldrick has done well. He’s really progressed from when we first put hands on him and started working with him. He’s gotten better every day, so that’s really been encouraging. He’s been consistent. Big guys we try to tighten them up a little bit and he’s done really well. Very coachable. Very strong leg, and he’s had good accuracy this spring.”
Quinn on Brad Wing: “He’s got a tremendous work ethic… I think as his confidence grows and you could see the true ability come out, and he’s got a lot of ability. He’s very talented.”
Quinn on Dwayne Harris: “Yes (we view him as our primary returner). We’ve always needed two or three guys since I’ve been here to be able to handle those roles. You have Dwayne, you have Odell. Kickoff returns, he was fine. On punt returns, he took a step back, which we don’t like. We’ve talked about it and addressed the things we want to improve on… When you get beaten down so much like he does because he plays some tough positions and throws his body around and is relentless, every time you return it, you’re going to take hits. He got hurt early and never really rebounded from it. It was a tough year, but he had a heck of a year as a coverage man. First year, we saw what we wanted returner wise. Second year, we saw coverage, so hopefully this year we can throw it all together.”
PREDICTIONS: It’s impossible to make an informed prediction on Aldrick Rosas because he is such an unknown commodity. He has the tools and the Giants obviously like what they have seen in the spring from him. But you cannot replicate real-game pressure. It is those pressure kicks and consistency that define a place kicker. If he falters in the preseason, look for the Giants to quickly add a veteran to the mix.
FINAL DEPTH CHART: Brad Wing and Dwayne Harris are givens. Right now, it is Aldrick Rosas’ job to lose.

AncestryDNA Collaborates with Quest Diagnostics to Provide Home DNA Testing to Healthcare Consumers
July 21, 2017 By jude Leave a Comment Pathologists should note that this agreement is not without controversy as the question over who owns patients’ DNA information sparks warnings from legal experts
Did you ever wonder which lab does all the genetic testing for Ancestry as it offers to help consumers learn more about their family histories? Also, were you ever curious about the actual number of genetic tests that Ancestry has generated? After all, its advertisements for these genetic tests are ubiquitous.
You won’t have to wonder any longer, because Dark Daily has the answers. To the first question, it is Quest Diagnostics, Incorporated (NYSE:DGX)—one of the world’s largest clinical laboratory companies—that does the genetic sequencing on the consumer samples provided to it by Ancestry.
To the second question, the number of individual samples in the Ancestry repository and database is now four million, according to information on its website.
AncestryDNA (Ancestry) and Quest Diagnostics (Quest) now collaborate to help consumers learn about their family histories and unlock secrets in their DNA. Since August of 2016, Quest has performed the genomic testing for home DNA kits ordered through Ancestrydna.com. What impact might this have on medical laboratories that perform DNA testing for health and medical reasons?
DNA Testing Reveals Who We Truly Are
“We are very excited to be partnering with Quest Diagnostics to offer our consumer DNA test to more consumers around the world,” stated Tim Sullivan, President and CEO at Ancestry in a news release that announced the genetic testing agreement between the two companies.
To utilize the AncestryDNA service, consumers must first order a DNA kit online through the Ancestry website. The cost of the kit is $99. This includes instructions, a saliva collection tube, and a pre-paid return mailer.
 DNA collection kits like the one shown above let people at home do much of the work normally performed in clinical laboratory settings. Though it’s inexpensive compared to standard DNA testing, there is controversy over privacy and ownership of the DNA information. (Photo copyright: BBC/Getty Images.)
After collecting a saliva sample, the customer sends it in for processing. Once the test is completed, an e-mail notification informs the patient that the results can be viewed on AncestryDNA’s website. Typically, a test is completed within six to eight weeks.
The DNA test uses microarray-based autosomal DNA testing, analyzing as many as 700,000 changes in an individual’s genome. These changes (or variations) are called single-nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs for short. They are useful in identifying a person’s true ethnicity and can distinguish possible relatives from among people who have previously taken the AncestryDNA test.
“Our focus is on helping consumers around the world take advantage of the latest technology and science to help them learn more about themselves, their families, and their place in the world,” stated Sullivan in another news release.
Managing One’s Health with DNA Information
As noted earlier, AncestryDNA has collected more than four-million DNA samples. Remarkably, its genetic testing service is currently available in more than 30 countries around the globe, according to Ancestry’s website.
The two companies hope to expand their relationship to include the development of applications to explore valuable medical and health information for consumers.
“People are very interested in their family history, and knowing one’s family health history is very important in helping us manage our health,” noted Stephen Rusckowski, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Quest Diagnostics.
The actual genetic testing is being performed at Quest Diagnostics’ 200,000 square foot facility located in Marlborough, Mass. Quest Diagnostics was chosen for the collaboration after Ancestry requested proposals from several laboratory organizations.
“Adding a second diagnostic partner is a critical step forward as we work to continue to meet the consumer demand we’re seeing for our DNA tests in the US and markets around the world,” stated Ken Chahine, PhD, JD, Executive Vice President at Ancestry and professor at University of Utah S. J. Quinney College of Law in Salt Lake City, in a press release. “We’ll also now be able to move toward an East-West logistical approach, testing kits closer to where our consumers live and, ideally, reducing the time they need to wait to receive their results.”
Concerns Over Patient Privacy and DNA Ownership
Ancestry’s genetic testing program is not without its critics. There are concerns regarding privacy issues and DNA ownership for consumers who use AncestryDNA. Joel Winston, Esq. is a New York attorney who specializes in consumer protection law and commercial litigation. In an article, Winston claimed that Ancestry’s privacy policy and terms of service gave the company complete ownership and control of submitted DNA.
“There are three significant provisions in the AncestryDNA Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to consider on behalf of yourself and your genetic relatives: (1) the perpetual, royalty-free, world-wide license to use your DNA; (2) the warning that DNA information may be used against “you or a genetic relative”; (3) your waiver of legal rights,” Winston wrote.
He claims that Ancestry customers are relinquishing their genetic privacy when they agree to the terms online. Winston urged consumers to fully read, consider, and understand the terms before agreeing to them.
Ancestry responded to the claims by releasing updated terms and conditions for clarity regarding ownership of DNA and information sharing. The company maintains they do not claim ownership rights to DNA submitted to them for testing, and that they do not share DNA testing results with other entities and organizations without customer permission.
In an interview with BBC Radio 4, a spokesperson for Ancestry stated, “We do not share user data for research unless the user has voluntarily opted-in to that sharing.” Adding, “We always de-identify data before it’s shared with researchers, meaning the data is stripped of any information that could tie it back to its owner.”
Nevertheless, Ancestry also stated they would be removing the “perpetuity clause” in AncestryDNA’s online terms and agreements.
The controversy continues and has sparked much debate and reportage from outlets that follow trends in DNA testing and medical laboratories. One such report by the debunking site Snopes attempts to clarify the issues.
Regardless of the debate over ownership of a person’s DNA, this collaboration between Ancestry and Quest Diagnostics is an example of a company relying on diagnostic industry vendors and clinical laboratories to perform services for its customers. It illustrates the need for clinicians and laboratory professionals to remain current on industry trends in ways that might help their labs to increase profits and provide value-added services to consumers. Ancestry’s growing volume of consumer testing demonstrates that there is a potential market for medical laboratories that make themselves available to consumers to answer questions and concerns about DNA testing.

        SMA Included in Quest Diagnostics' New Genetic Carrier Screening Test                                                                                                                Quest Diagnostics’ New Genetic Carrier Screening Test, QHerit, Includes SMA    July 20, 2017 by Magdalena Kegel In News.        Click Here to receive SMA News via e-mail        Quest Diagnostics has launched a new screening test to assess the possibility that parents carry genes that might cause spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and a range of other diseases in their future children. The test, called QHerit, takes into account that people today often have a mixed ethnic background, and included SMA after the American College of Gynecology (ACOG) changed its screening guidelines in March 2017 to include SMA tests for all women who are — or are considering becoming — pregnant. This was a change from earlier recommendations, where only people with a family history of SMA were encouraged to be screened. The new test has also done away with assumptions that people are of an assumed ancestry. “The United States is truly a melting pot, and it no longer makes sense for physicians to assume genetic screening is appropriate for an individual based on presumed race or ethnicity,” Felicitas Lacbawan, MD, executive medical director of advanced diagnostics at Quest Diagnostics, said in a press release. “QHerit is designed for any woman and her partner, not just those in a specific, so-called high-risk ethnic or racial group,” Lacbawan said. Earlier carrier screening tests were developed with people of a specific ethnicity in mind, and focused on a few diseases that are more common in people with that ancestry. But the latest ACOG guideline recommends that people should be screened in a pan-ethnic manner, meaning that screening should be performed across all ethnicities. Screening should also be extended to the partner of a woman who wishes to become pregnant. The changes reflect that particular disorders are increasingly less likely to be found only in specific ethnic groups as changing socio-demographic factors have made ethnically mixed ancestry much more common. A recent study from the Pew Research Center found that 18 percent of people living together have a partner of another race or ethnicity. For newly married couples, the number is 17 percent. People with Asian or Hispanic ancestry were most likely to have a partner of a different ethnicity, while increases in mixed marriages were most obvious among African Americans. “We carefully designed our new QHerit screening test to provide highly accurate insights about heritable risk in a wide variety of patients. It complements our menu of innovations in women’s health, with tests that provide insights at every age and stage of a woman’s life, including when she and her partner are considering starting a family,” Lacbawan said. “It is critical that we expand our dialogue with patients who are considering pregnancy to include a discussion on expanded genetic carrier screening,” added Jeff Dlott, MD, medical director of Quest. “Screening with QHerit allows us to follow a guidelines-recommended approach to counsel our patients on their risk of passing on heritable genetic diseases and their options in planning and the preconception.” Print This Page        Click Here to receive SMA News via e-mail        Leave a Comment Cancel reply  Your email address will not be published.

Drug-testing companies can’t find workers

By Paul Danish -  July 19, 2017 1 



 
Heh.
Other than the mass arrests (25 million and counting for pot alone since 1965), probably the ugliest thing that came out of the war on drugs has been the introduction of drug testing into American life.
This filthy, totalitarian practice has, to a large extent, become the new normal for people seeking everything from jobs to insurance.
It’s become so widely practiced by employers that Colorado’s Amendment 64, which legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, contained language specifically allowing companies to continue testing. (Politics is the art of the possible, and Amendment 64 would have drawn too much business opposition if it had prohibited employers from testing and firing pot users, even if pot use was legal.)
But now some of the businesses that test for marijuana and practice zero tolerance, are getting their comeuppance: It turns out they’re having a hard time finding employees.
According to a story that appeared earlier this year in the Washington Post, the McLane Company, a grocery supplier whose workers “drive forklifts and load hefty boxes into trucks” is finding that prospective hires at a warehouse it operates in Colorado keep failing drug tests.
“Some weeks this year, 90 percent of applicants would test positive for something,” according to Laura Stephens, a human resources manager for the company. A positive test disqualified the applicants.
“Finding people to fill jobs is really challenging,” she said.
She added that companies such as hers, where employees operate heavy equipment, continue to test for marijuana out of concern for everyone’s safety.
Hogwash.
McLane uses “follicle tests,” which look for pot traces in a hair sample. Such tests can detect marijuana traces three months or more after someone smokes. The test tells you nothing about whether someone is high, impaired or hung-over on the job, which is what really matters if the company is concerned about safety.
McLane probably doesn’t disqualify employees for off-work alcohol use — if it did, finding employees would probably go from “really challenging” to “mission impossible”— which means it is willing to hire someone who has a few drinks less than 24 hours before coming to work, but not someone who smokes pot a few weeks before coming to work.
If safety is the issue, the company should test for impairment before a worker starts a shift. Video-game-like devices that do this have been on the market for 20 years, and reveal impairment from all sources, not just pot.
The fact that the company doesn’t use these devices means that when it comes to safety, it’s blowing smoke.
According to Quest Diagnostics, the lab which conducted 10 million drug tests from across the country last year, two percent of the samples they tested were positive for marijuana. Compare that with McLane’s experience of 90 percent of prospective employees testing positive.
One reason for the difference is that most of the tests that Quest conducts are urine tests, which are much easier to defeat, either by drying out for a few weeks before the test or substituting a clean sample.
What this suggests is that large numbers of people who are required to take drug tests to get a job cheat — which means their employers are hiring employees who began their relationship with the company by lying to the boss. In other words, millions of employer-employee relationships begin with mutual distrust and deceit. Hell of a way to run a company.
Truck and school bus drivers are required by law to prove they don’t have pot in their systems before they’re hired. According to Curtis Graves, the information manager at the Mountain States Employers Council, “some employers are extremely worried about filling jobs” that require a test.
Well, here’s a way to take some of the challenge and worry out of filling all those jobs: set the pay for workers who are required not to use drugs high enough to make it worth their while not to get high.
Alternatively quit trying to tell people how to live their lives when they’re not at work.

Four Easy Steps to Market Your Practice OnlineThanks to advancing technology, marketing a medical practice online doesn't have to be costly and confusing. In fact, it can be distilled down into four basic steps that anyone can take. These are: (1) Creating a viable, enhanced practice website, (2) utilizing techniques to be found by patients online, (3) engaging in social media and mobile health apps, and (4) monitoring your online reputation. We'll discuss these in this whitepaper as well as the best practices for each.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

Quest Diagnostics set a record in April 2009 when it paid $302 million to the government to settle a Medicare fraud case alleging the company sold faulty medical testing kits. It was the largest qui tam (whistleblower) settlement paid by a medical lab for manufacturing and distributing a faulty product.[13] In May 2011, Quest paid $241 million to the state of California to settle a False Claims Act case that alleged the company had overcharged Medi-Cal, the state’s Medicaid program, and provided illegal kickbacks as incentives for healthcare providers to use Quest labs.[14]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
