We are very proud and humbled to be able to simplify and assist countless consumers in their everyday lives from the fields mentioned with such a innovative product that is composed of FDA approved medical grade plastics and is environmentally safe.

Our Representatives will be pleased to come to your business or residence and demonstrate The MedTainer™ for your team, answer any of their questions and make certain that they are confident and efficient when they introduce their patients to the product.   Markets   The MedTainer™ was originally developed for geriatric and pediatric patients who had difficulty swallowing pills or needed an effective alternative to costly name-brand medications. The MedTainer™ has been sold and is being successfully used throughout the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America and Europe. Our association with the Medical Marijuana community was an unexpected windfall that has given Acology, Inc. the necessary funding to expand into the growing hospice and palliative care markets, and to help countless patients who are living at home or in small home-like settings and need help swallowing pills. The addition of three important and influential members of the medical community, Dr. Vince Nguyen, Director of the Hoag Hospital CARES Program, Dr. Michael Demoratz, Administrator of 24/7 Supportive Care Network and Dr. Josh Luke, Director of the National Re-Admission Prevention Collaborative, has given Acology, Inc. a vital and growing presence and acceptance in the national medical care community. We are seeking distributors throughout the world with a successful record of distributing products, financial stability and a sales staff with the size and capacity to create demand for our products.        RECENT NEWS    October 24, 2016 08:30 ET Partnership Between Acology and Kush Shows Early Momentum CORONA, CA--(Marketwired - October 24, 2016) - The announcement on September 20 of the partnership between Acology Inc. (OTC PINK: ACOL) and Kush Bottles (OTCQB: KSHB) sent shockwaves through the cannabis packaging industry and created stock gains for both companies as the US moves toward the pivotal November election. California is now expected to ratify Prop.64, legalizing cannabis for recreational use and sending orders for compliant packaging soaring.   Nicholas Kovacevich, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Kush Bottles, said, "The MedTainer™ is a great addition to our growing portfolio of customizable products, which have been shown to create a steady stream of recurring revenue, as customers typically reorder customized products. The MedTainer™ was particularly appealing to us because our customers can use it as a promotional giveaway or accessory cross-sell to help build their brand. Our customers can use this product as a premium packaging solution or continue to purchase other forms of branded packaging, such as barrier bags or labels, while ordering custom MedTainers as a promotional item," concluded Mr. Kovacevich. Acology's signature product, the MedTainer™, has been gaining traction with sales exceeding expectations for calendar 2016. In addition to the revenues generated by customizing and branding MedTainers, as the states that are positioning for legalization begin to codify compliant packaging regulations, including certified child-resistance, proper labeling and product track-ability, the MedTainer™ is seen as the perfect packaging solution for cannabis end-users. The MedTainer's certificate for child-resistance comes from Child Related Research Inc. in Murray, Utah. Accredited here in the US and internationally, and given an A+ rating by the BBB, CRR Inc. gave a rare 100% rating to the MedTainer™ along with its Child-Resistance Certificate.  For investor or sales information please visit Acology Inc. and D&C Distributors online or by phone. The company is located in their production and distribution facility at 1620 Commerce St. Corona, California, 92880.  Acology trades on the OTC under the call letters ACOL. The company's websites are www.Acologyinc.com for the hospice and palliative care industry and www.themedtainer.com for the recreational and medical marijuana industry.

November 07, 2016 10:07 ET Acology Poised to Capture Canada CORONA, CA--(Marketwired - November 07, 2016) - Acology Inc. (OTC PINK: ACOL) announced today that agreements are pending between their agents in Canada and the national Canadian healthcare service (Health Canada) to adopt the MedTainer™ as the premier packaging solution for cannabis users throughout the country. There is a growing voice throughout the country for total legalization for recreational use. At this moment, 3 of the top 5 medical cannabis consumer companies, Aurora, Organigram Pharm and Redecan Pharm, use MedTainers exclusively for their customer bases. Cannabis is legal to possess, consume, or grow for medicinal purposes under conditions outlined in the Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations[6] issued by Health Canada. In June 2015, the City of Vancouver regulated the sale of medical cannabis from municipally licensed dispensaries. The Liberal Party of Canada supports the legalization and regulation of cannabis for recreational use. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau supports ending the prohibition of marijuana and has advocated his and the party's stance for complete legalization multiple times since his ascendancy as Prime Minister.  Acology has had a strong presence in Canada since January 2014, with more than 200K sales units sold and high six-figure revenues. Acology is actively positioning the Medtainer to be the packaging system for what is believed to be a National Canadian cannabis industry sanctioned by the government in Ottawa. Fulfilling the mandate laid down for child-resistance, labeling and track-ability, the MedTainer has been shown to be an excellent solution for medical retailers and wholesalers in Canada. Acology is uniquely positioned to take advantage of new changes in the law when cannabis is legalized for recreational use nationally. Most importantly, it is also in position to fulfill the mandates for compliance when the US Federal Government lifts sanctions on cannabis use, using its Canadian experience as a template. For investor or sales information please visit Acology Inc. and D&C Distributors online or by phone. The company is located in their production and distribution facility at 1620 Commerce St. Corona, California, 92880.  Acology trades on the OTC under the call letters ACOL. The company's websites are www.Acologyinc.com for the hospice and palliative care industry and www.themedtainer.com for the recreational and medical marijuana industry. Orders for Acology products can be taken online and by phone. Custom orders are especially welcome. Please send any and all inquiries to info@acologyinc.com or call (844) ACOLOGY (844-226-5649). Ask for Jack Rein, National Services Director.

Because such statements deal with future events they are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results for fiscal year 2016 and beyond could differ materially from the company's current expectations. Forward-looking statements are identified by such words as "anticipates", "projects", "expects", "planned", "intends" and "believes" "estimate" "targets" and other similar expressions that indicate trends and future events. It is understood that investment entails risk on the part of the investor and could result in the loss of some or all of his or her investment.   Acology Revenues Advance Following Elections CORONA, CA--(Marketwired - November 21, 2016) - Acology Inc. (OTC PINK: ACOL) published its 10Q today and is pleased to report that revenues have increased substantially from this same period last year. The unexpected presidential election results could give Acology's American-Made products and services more traction than was previously projected. The Trump Administration has stated publicly that American manufacturers and sales organizations would receive preferential treatment. Many of the packaging products that are currently used in the US cannabis industry come from China and other countries, which could face much tougher tariffs under the Trump administration. Acology's signature product, The MedTainer™, is 100% manufactured and sold in the United States. Acology intends to exploit this advantage against other foreign-made and inferior competitors' products.  The national elections were a successful referendum for the cannabis industry with 8 more states voting to legalize the use of recreational or medical cannabis products. This brings to 26 the number of states that have legalized cannabis use. Acology's home state, California, is the biggest winner, with potential tax revenues rising into the billions as more licenses are granted and operators rush to enter the industry. Acology's location advantages are evident, both in the volume of products sold and the steady increase of new vendors seen in the past year.

January 03, 2017 08:30 ET Acology Announces Partnership with Boveda Inc. CORONA, CA--(Marketwired - January 03, 2017) - Prior to traveling to Canada this week to conclude business that may dramatically expand business throughout North America, Acology Inc. (OTC PINK: ACOL) announced a partnership with Boveda Inc. and will begin immediately to place the state-of-the-art, patented 2-way humidity packs into their signature product, the MedTainer™.  Available in multiple sizes and humidity levels, Boveda is the only company in the world that can solve intermediate moisture needs and maintain the ideal humidity content of the items inside containers, whether they be plastic or glass. Boveda is FDA-compliant and is manufactured primarily from natural elements, salt and water. Boveda humidity packs have become one of the key components for cannabis growers and manufacturers in keeping their products properly hydrated. In addition, each Boveda pack also contains a mold-inhibitor. With the addition of a Boveda pack in each retail and wholesale MedTainer offered for sale internationally the end-user can be assured of a fresh, properly-maintained product. Please visit the attached media describing the relationship of how Boveda and the MedTainer will work together. Acology begins the new year in the enviable position of being the only pharmaceutical container made from FDA approved PP#5 that is certified child-resistant and can be purchased world-wide. Vendors, retailers and end-users can now be assured that wherever Acology products are sent the contents will arrive properly maintained and ready for use.

Acology Inc. Announces New Product Line: Potential Big Bottom Line Increase




CORONA, CA--(Marketwired - May 2, 2016) -  Acology Inc. (OTC PINK: ACOL) is announcing today that the company has entered into an exclusive agreement with Crocs Lighters Inc., based in Brea, California, to provide affordable custom lighters to their more than 1500 national and global vendors. The first shipment from Croc's is due this week. Acology anticipates initial sales to fall between 15,000 and 30,000 units in the first 45 days and increase to 100,000 per month by the end of the 3rd calendar quarter of 2016. The net sales revenue would add an additional $100k per month to Acology's bottom line by the end of the year. Acology chose Croc's Lighters Inc. over many competitors due to their excellent track record, premium-quality products and full EDI capabilities.

Triple Production Efficiency 

In addition, Acology announced today that they have perfected a proprietary printing capability to print custom, durable and high-resolution images and information on many products in addition to their signature product, The MedTainer™. Acology has installed and made operational a new, larger-format printer. Acology required printing that provided several distinctive features: sharp image resolution, a much higher production capacity, multiple-surface diversity and speed of production. Acology's custom-built printers now provide excellent solutions to these challenges. These custom-built printers' capabilities and the solutions they are providing to Acology's expanding vendor base will accomplish several different goals: Precise reproduction of artwork, multi-surface/size capability, increased product flexibility and triple production volume. 
Acology's main purpose has always been to associate with excellent business partners that can move the proverbial needle. The early sales success of 2016, coupled with enhanced capabilities and product diversity, will create the proper environment for sustained growth for the remainder of this year and for the foreseeable future.
