Glint is an organizational development platform for the digital age.








Get a clear picture of engagement in real time, anytime.

 

The health of your organization can be difficult to assess—especially when your data is weeks or months old and lives in static reports only a few leaders can access. But what if you had complete visibility into employee engagement in real time and could use that information to develop effective strategies?

 

Glint gives HR teams, leaders, and managers on-demand access to the most current data and displays it in ways that highlight strengths, weaknesses, trends and areas of concern at a glance.

 



Every organization has a unique engagement formula—find yours.

 

Each organization and each team has a unique combination of people, culture and mission. How do you determine your own formula across a global, diverse workforce and identify what's working or what needs improvement? 

 

Glint does the data analysis for you and surfaces insights that help you focus on engagement issues at the heart of your organization—issues that prevent you from meeting your business goals.

 



The power to effect real change.

 

Uncovering insights from employee engagement data is only valuable if your organization takes action—and at Glint, we understand how critical managers are to any employee engagement strategy.

 

Our platform is uniquely designed to overcome the typical barriers to action by guiding leaders and managers through the process of strengthening engagement and driving results.

 
















             
        


Keep your finger on the pulse.

                    Glint Pulses gather powerful data in no time, providing actionable results in real time. Use Glint’s standard questions based on proven drivers of engagement, add your own and tailor them by team as needed. Confidential Pulses take just minutes for employees to complete from desktop, mobile or kiosk—and update to Glint instantly.  
                









Start with the big picture.

                    Glint’s interactive Dashboard displays a holistic visual breakdown of an entire organization’s health, identifies areas that need attention and allows users to drill down into data as deep as they want. 
                
HR, leaders and managers all see the engagement results specific to their roles, giving them quick visibility into response rates, scores, trends and alerts. 
                




















Pinpoint the hot spots.
Glint Heat Maps are visual reports that compare engagement levels across employee populations, on demand. From team to tenure, geography to gender—pick any attribute, and Glint instantly maps your organization’s strengths and opportunities.
                
















Get to the bottom of it.
Nearly every number you see in Glint is a starting point for further analysis. Filter results by any combination of attributes to explore data as deeply as you want. If you need to move quickly, Glint’s ready-to-run reports instantly provide response rates, engagement results and presentation-ready visualizations. 
                








Know where you stand.
To see how your organization measures up, Glint compares your performance with external benchmarks, internal company averages and your own past performance to help you quickly assess your strengths, weaknesses and trends.



 
        














Connect the dots between drivers and impact.
Glint reveals each organization’s particular path to improvement by linking driver scores to engagement levels, as well as other business outcomes. A low-scoring driver is only part of the story—Glint combines scores and their potential impact to highlight which weaknesses need immediate attention.
This gives the HR team and senior leadership a clear priority list of where to invest first and how it should improve the health of the organization.























Install an early warning system.
Glint’s AI-for-HR™ technology uses predictive analytics and machine learning to generate real-time alerts for employee populations at risk of increased attrition, decreased performance or changes to other key performance indicators.
This revolutionary capability helps you spot anomalies hidden in the data before they impact engagement, giving leaders and managers time to put informed plans in place.









True understanding of open-ended feedback.

                Glint’s Narrative Intelligence™ is a next-generation natural language processing (NLP) engine that extracts meaning from thousands of open-ended responses. Drawing from Glint’s organizational taxonomy framework and AI-for-HR™ technology, Narrative Intelligence connects the dots between what your employees say, how they feel, and the relationship to engagement and other outcomes — all in real time.

                The result? True understanding that leads to effective action.

























Show managers where to focus their energy.
As soon as a pulse survey is completed, Glint’s artificial intelligence provides managers with recommended Focus Areas specific to the engagement dynamics of their teams. Glint also explains why a Focus Area has been recommended—typically a low comparative score on a high-impact engagement driver—so managers fully understand why it’s important.

















Build simple plans. Trigger real action.
Within each Focus Area, Glint suggests best practices and provides a knowledge base to help managers quickly and easily create an Action Plan. Managers can explore Glint’s proprietary content, developed through academic research and consulting expertise, or your existing learning content for a deeper dive into the best way to approach the necessary tasks. 










Monitor the impact of Action Plans. 
As Action Plans are being completed, managers can monitor progress and receive timely reminders to maintain focus on the end goal. HR leaders are able to see a wider view of Action Plan progress across the entire organization, allowing them to make smarter program and support investments to help managers succeed.

Glint is an organizational development platform for the digital age.








Get a clear picture of engagement in real time, anytime.

 

The health of your organization can be difficult to assess—especially when your data is weeks or months old and lives in static reports only a few leaders can access. But what if you had complete visibility into employee engagement in real time and could use that information to develop effective strategies?

 

Glint gives HR teams, leaders, and managers on-demand access to the most current data and displays it in ways that highlight strengths, weaknesses, trends and areas of concern at a glance.

 



Every organization has a unique engagement formula—find yours.

 

Each organization and each team has a unique combination of people, culture and mission. How do you determine your own formula across a global, diverse workforce and identify what's working or what needs improvement? 

 

Glint does the data analysis for you and surfaces insights that help you focus on engagement issues at the heart of your organization—issues that prevent you from meeting your business goals.

 



The power to effect real change.

 

Uncovering insights from employee engagement data is only valuable if your organization takes action—and at Glint, we understand how critical managers are to any employee engagement strategy.

 

Our platform is uniquely designed to overcome the typical barriers to action by guiding leaders and managers through the process of strengthening engagement and driving results.

Glint is the People Success Platform.
People fuel the success of your organization. And it’s never been so easy — and so costly — to lose touch with what they need.
It’s not enough to modify the employee engagement survey to try to meet their changing needs. Glint uses a different approach — one that combines modern organizational science, revolutionary technology, and intuitive design to help you empower your people, not just respond to them.









             
        


Architected for people, not surveys.
The success of your people is a complex combination of empowerment, purpose, growth, and more. It’s a formula that continually evolves throughout the employee experience.
Unlike survey providers, Glint is built on a people-centric architecture that captures data throughout the employee lifecycle, giving you a more complete picture of your people. And it’s designed to support complex, global organizations, regardless of how they’re organized — or how often they’re reorganized.









Insight on where you’re going, not where you’ve been.
Many engagement solutions are a lot like history class — detailed information about a time long ago. Others offer speed, but not deep insight.
Glint delivers speed and insight. Proactive intelligence immediately surfaces opportunities, predicts risks, and most importantly, prescribes action. Our customers often refer to Glint as their “crystal ball,” helping them address problems before they become major issues that impact results.
















             
        


More frequent conversations about growth and development.
Your people don’t assess their job satisfaction, or their career options, once a year. When they think your organization has stopped listening, your people are at risk — and so is your business.
Glint is designed for continuous improvement, facilitating an ongoing cycle of feedback, learning, and change between managers and employees. It’s a process that helps employees feel heard and everyone feel empowered to do their best work.










Engagement isn’t the end, it’s the beginning
To know whether your people initiatives are working, you need the ability to quantify their effect on business outcomes. With too many solutions, understanding what drives business results is a slow, disconnected process.
Glint delivers integrated business linkage that helps you see and take action on the relationship between your people’s experiences and business outcomes like retention, customer satisfaction, and much more. These complex relationships are displayed visually, in your dashboard, on demand.



“We’ve reduced our regrettable turnover by 26% since we started using Glint. A big part of this improvement is our ability to form more targeted people strategies.”
SCOTT WALKER, OPOWER

Our Story
At some organizations, engagement seems to happen naturally. People feel it. They’re committed, energetic, attached. Positive attitudes and behaviors are transmitted to each new hire. A virtuous cycle.
At other organizations, engagement is uneven and difficult to sustain. People feel this too. Some do only what’s necessary to get by. Why go the extra mile when others are coasting? Energy ebbs. People leave. Momentum never takes hold.
We created Glint to help organizations measure and improve employee engagement. We want to provide the same type of real-time, data-driven platform that can be found in almost any other business function (sales, marketing, manufacturing, service) for the most important part of any organization — its people.









Culture
At Glint, we believe in awe-inspiring design. We are real, curious, collaborative and fun. We strive to create ecstatic customers. And, we really do want to make people’s work lives better.
