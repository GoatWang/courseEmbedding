CUSIP No. 141633107 
This Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D (Amendment) amends and supplements the Schedule 13D previously filed on July 11, 2016 (the
Statement) by the Reporting Persons (as defined below) relating to common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock), of Care.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company). Unless otherwise indicated
herein, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment shall have the same meaning ascribed to such terms in the Statement. Except as set forth herein, this Amendment does not modify any information previously reported by the Reporting
Persons in the Statement.  This Amendment is being filed to report a change in beneficial ownership of the Common Stock in an amount equal to one percent
or more of the Common Stock, as a result of a decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and an increase in the Liquidation Preference of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock by the amount of cumulative dividend accrued. As
used in this Amendment, the term Reporting Persons collectively refers to:   


 

 
CapitalG LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Fund);   


 

 
CapitalG GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the General Partner)1; 
 


 

 
Google Inc., a Delaware corporation; and   


 

 
Alphabet Inc., a Delaware corporation.  Item 4. Purpose of Transaction. 
Item 4 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following: 
On December 29, 2016, the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) of each share of Convertible
Preferred Stock increased by an amount equal to the cumulative dividend, which had accrued at a rate of 5.50% per annum during the period from the Closing Date to and including December 29, 2016, and is payable semi-annually in additional
Liquidation Preference. As a result of such increase, the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Convertible Preferred Stock may convert also increased. 
Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.  Items
5(a)-(b) are hereby amended and restated to read as follows:  (a) and (b)
Based on information in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 1,
2016, there were 28,819,449 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of October 26, 2016. As a result of its purchase pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Fund holds 46,350 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock,
convertible at any time at the Funds option into 4,535,679 shares of Common Stock, or 13.6% of the Common Stock deemed issued and outstanding as of October 26, 2016, based on the initial conversion price of $10.50 per share, subject
to certain adjustments.  Each of the General Partner, Google Inc. (as the managing member of the General Partner), and Alphabet Inc. (as
the sole stockholder of Google Inc.) may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the securities owned directly by the Fund, and each disclaims beneficial ownership of such securities. 
 


1 
The General Partner is beneficially owned by Alphabet Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which is in turn wholly owned by Google Inc. Alphabet Holdings LLC may be deemed to have the power to vote and
dispose of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock directly owned by the Fund, and disclaims beneficial ownership of such shares, except to the extent of any pecuniary interest therein. 


SIGNATURES 
After reasonable inquiry and to the best of each of the undersigneds knowledge and belief, each of the undersigned certifies that the information set
forth in this statement is true, complete and correct.

CUSIP No. 141633107 
This Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D (Amendment) amends and supplements the Schedule 13D previously filed on July 11, 2016 (the
Statement) by the Reporting Persons (as defined below) relating to common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock), of Care.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company). Unless otherwise indicated
herein, capitalized terms used but not defined in this Amendment shall have the same meaning ascribed to such terms in the Statement. Except as set forth herein, this Amendment does not modify any information previously reported by the Reporting
Persons in the Statement.  This Amendment is being filed to report a change in beneficial ownership of the Common Stock in an amount equal to one percent
or more of the Common Stock, as a result of a decrease in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and an increase in the Liquidation Preference of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock by the amount of cumulative dividend accrued. As
used in this Amendment, the term Reporting Persons collectively refers to:   


 

 
CapitalG LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the Fund);   


 

 
CapitalG GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the General Partner)1; 
 


 

 
Google Inc., a Delaware corporation; and   


 

 
Alphabet Inc., a Delaware corporation.  Item 4. Purpose of Transaction. 
Item 4 is hereby amended and supplemented by adding the following: 
On December 29, 2016, the Liquidation Preference (as defined in the Certificate of Designations) of each share of Convertible
Preferred Stock increased by an amount equal to the cumulative dividend, which had accrued at a rate of 5.50% per annum during the period from the Closing Date to and including December 29, 2016, and is payable semi-annually in additional
Liquidation Preference. As a result of such increase, the number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Convertible Preferred Stock may convert also increased. 
Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.  Items
5(a)-(b) are hereby amended and restated to read as follows:  (a) and (b)
Based on information in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 1,
2016, there were 28,819,449 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of October 26, 2016. As a result of its purchase pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the Fund holds 46,350 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock,
convertible at any time at the Funds option into 4,535,679 shares of Common Stock, or 13.6% of the Common Stock deemed issued and outstanding as of October 26, 2016, based on the initial conversion price of $10.50 per share, subject
to certain adjustments.  Each of the General Partner, Google Inc. (as the managing member of the General Partner), and Alphabet Inc. (as
the sole stockholder of Google Inc.) may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the securities owned directly by the Fund, and each disclaims beneficial ownership of such securities. 
 


1 
The General Partner is beneficially owned by Alphabet Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, which is in turn wholly owned by Google Inc. Alphabet Holdings LLC may be deemed to have the power to vote and
dispose of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock directly owned by the Fund, and disclaims beneficial ownership of such shares, except to the extent of any pecuniary interest therein. 


SIGNATURES 
After reasonable inquiry and to the best of each of the undersigneds knowledge and belief, each of the undersigned certifies that the information set
forth in this statement is true, complete and correct.
