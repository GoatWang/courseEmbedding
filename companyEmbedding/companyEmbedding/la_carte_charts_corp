Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

required if seeking foreign qualification in any
other state.

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is
required to file the Articles of Incorporation / Organization.



Should I reserve my company name before placing an order?

Absolutely not, in most cases we file the company within one day of receiving an order.

please contact us immediately upon placing an order so that we can submit the filing with
the name reservation attached to the articles of formation.

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

No, documents requiring signature will be signed by our staff. For the corporation we will
sign as the incorporator and as the organizer for an LLC.

The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Selling 
Shareholder Shares.


Within this massive market, on a broad scale, the Company competes with a host
of investment websites and traditional brokerages/advisors that have blogs,
newsletters, websites, apps, and segments on TV shows. So while the Company has
found no exact competition to it’s a La Carte Charts product, there are similar
apps out there. While most brokerage companies offer “stock screeners,” they are
very difficult to setup for your average investor and one needs to be in front
of a computer to do so. The Company’s apps offer the list at the users’
fingertips without need of technical know-how.

Other than brokerages, the biggest competition is from sites like
www.TheStreet.com, Yahoo Finance, Stocktwits, and others that offer subscription
services. They are not direct competition, though, and should be considered
parallel businesses. They offer stock picks based on subjective analysis and
commentary. A La Carte Charts applications simply deliver a list of stocks that
match the chart that the purchaser selects. In fact, all of the aforementioned
sites are great places to advertise.

With the rapidly growing size of the retail investor market, however, new
competitors will continually enter the market. Robinhood, for example, is a new
crowd-sourced investor app that uses a “social investing” algorithm to provide
watch lists for popular stocks, along with financial articles, trends, and a
personalized stock-trading feed.

The Company and its Chart apps will exist to supplement and enhance the market
for the everyday investor.


Company Description
A La Carte Charts Corporation (“ALCC”), is a United States-based startup web and
mobile application company designed to deliver informative products to the 
common investor in today’s global markets. The Company intends to offer 
investors and traders a sophisticated, trustworthy, and


 individualized way to 
get actionable daily information for the burgeoning self-directed market. Over 
the past few years, David Meyers, the Company’s founder and CEO, has developed a
unique collection of daily information sources that provide systematic and 
common sense insights for making trades on virtually any market. Mr. Meyers has
become renowned as a go-to investment expert, having appeared on CNBC and 
TheStreet.com, offering investment guidance to the public. The Company intends 
to apply its founder’s acumen and insight and offer the same to the public 
through development of a mobile application and web service, (the “Common Man 
Investor Platform”), which the Company intends to launch upon completion of 
development. Following development of the software and completion of web build,
the Company shall offer a series of digital products for the everyday, “Common 
Man” investor.

The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in April 2016, and was
formerly known as Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation.

In December 2016, the Company implemented a change of control by redeeming
shares of existing shareholders, issuing shares to new shareholders, electing
new officers and directors and accepting the resignations of its then existing
officers and directors. In connection with the change of control, the
shareholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the
change of the Company’s name from Ruby Island Acquisition Corporation to A La
Carte Charts Corporation.

The main product of the Company will be its daily “charts,” delivered via web
and mobile applications (the A La Carte “Apps”), to be compatible with Android,
iPhone and other smart devices on the market. The Company’s Apps will each
revolve around a specific trading strategy or market trend, such as the Head and
Shoulders App, Bullish Wedge App, Commodities in Contango App, and Ascending
Triangles App, among others. Through nuts-and-bolts data on market trends and
sound real-world advice, the Company intends to enable its subscribers to find
practical information they can use in their trading and investing.

As of the date of this Prospectus, an affiliate of the Company, A La Carte
Charts LLC, an Arizona Limited Liability Company (“La Carte LLC”) of which the
Company’s founder, David Meyers, is sole member and 100% owner, has invested
$150,000 in development of its proprietary software and mobile Apps. In January
and June 2017, pursuant to a two-phase development proposal (the “Software
Contracts”) that have been attached altogether as an Exhibit to this
Registration Statement, La Carte LLC has engaged Vuria LLC (“Vuria”), an
eSolutions provider, to provide state of the art mobile application development
and functionality (the “Apps Development”). The Apps Development includes
integrated solutions for iPhone and Android mobile device platforms, including
optimal graphic design, user-friendly digital architecture and programming. Upon
completion of the Apps Development, The Company anticipates that its affiliate
will assign all rights, including intellectual property and otherwise, of and
relating to the Apps Development.

Pursuant to the Software Contracts, La Carte LLC invested $80,000 in May 2017
and an additional $70,000 in June 2017 for further upgrades to optimize and
enhance functionality and design of the Apps. The Company’s affiliate
anticipates completion of the upgrades, pursuant to the Software Contract, by
year-end 2017.

Upon completion of the Apps Development, the Company intends to secure
assignment from La Carte LLC to all rights, including intellectual property and
otherwise, of and relating to the Apps Development.

In addition, as of the date of this Prospectus, the Company’s founder has
personally invested $20,000 (twenty thousand dollars) to obtain optimal servers,
data and 2100 square feet of office space. Amazon Web Services provides server
utilities to be utilized by the Apps Development. On these servers, data is
collected from Barcharts, LLC, which provides the requisite market data
necessary for functionality of the Apps.

Statistics from the Boston Consulting Group demonstrate $34 trillion in assets
under management in North America alone. The active (retail) segment of the
market in the U.S. is approximately $2.8 trillion annually, including $1.8
trillion from non-professional retail traders. Many investors, especially the
under-50 group, are continually choosing non-traditional and technologically
advanced investing methods as alternative to the traditional advisor/broker
route. A La Carte Charts, with its new Apps, will help to bridge the gap between
savvy affluent investor and the everyday investor who is seeking to improve his
or her knowledge base and build long-term strategies to increase dividends.

The goal of A La Carte Charts is to help millions of investors find success,
while growing into a well-known investment-data platform and fund portfolio. To
fully launch operations, the Company is seeking an investment of $5,000,000,
which shall be utilized for further modifications and enhancement of the Apps
Development, for marketing and advertising expenses, for ongoing costs to
maintain server, data and office lease, and for executive salaries and
compensation and to hire staff, as needed. In the alternative, if the Company is
unable to achieve its investment goals, the Company will launch its product
as-is and the Company’s Founder and CEO David Meyers will make ongoing,
no-interest loans to the Company to sustain operations until profitability or
subsequent investment.

The Company aims to be a one-stop shop for all active investors seeking optimum
investment information and insights. For example, the Company’s mobile app.
already provides full analytical charts of the most popular charts in the
investment market, including inverse head and shoulders, head and shoulders,
double bottom, cup and handle, bear flags, etc. In addition, the Company shall
track and link to the most pertinent fundamental articles from the web and
provide easy, relevant access for investors. The Company also intends to offer
informative pages that educate investors as to dividend dates and rates of all
major stocks, the contango/roll yield of all major ETF’s and ETN’s, and app
participants will have the opportunity to rate each stock chart that we provide.
The ratings of the charts by users will then rank the stock from strongest chart
to weakest for investors to use and help them gather information.

Detailed Description


Welcome To TrackMaster Results Charts

TrackMaster Results Charts provides the same reliable information as found in the official charts such as race times, points of call, lengths back, parked out and break symbols, driver, official odds, and comments plus a handful of enhanced data. The charts are offered in several formats to suit various needs.

The files are available in either text, xml or comma delimited format easily viewed and/or imported into the various programming applications. They are available for download 24 hours a day, often shortly after the races depending on the track schedule.

Special Features of TrackMaster Results Charts

OFFICIAL RESULTS

All official results direct from the track chart caller with complete positional calls, lengths behind, special symbols, race times and comments when recorded.

PERFORMANCE RATINGS

TrackMaster produces several different ratings for harness racing. Speed ratings are for horses and measure performance in a single race. Class ratings are for races and judge the level of competition. For all ratings, the higher the number the better.

Click here for details and an important notice about our exclusive ratings.

- SPEED RATINGS: TrackMaster assigns a speed rating to each horse's race, where there is enough information to accurately do so. These ratings tell you how fast a horse has been performing. It is based on the horse's actual time and other factors, such as the composition and condition of the track and the post position the horse started from.

- CLASS RATINGS: TrackMaster assigns a class rating to today's and historical races. The class rating for a race is made up of a weighted average of the previous speed ratings from the horses entered in that race. The number is basically a projection of what the expected winning speed rating would be for that particular race.

PACE FIGURES

In addition to the horse's race speed rating, individual fractional pace figures are computed for the various segments of the races. These figures when averaged together will equal the final speed rating. Handicappers use these to identify during which parts of the race the horse did its best work, looking for horses that made more than one sustained move or looking for horses with dominating early or late ability.

TRACK VARIANTS

The track variant is calculated using a proprietary formula which computes the difference between the expected and actual winning times at a track. The resulting number is then added to the speed ratings, compensating for the various day-to-day factors affecting the track condition. This can even vary between races as conditions change.

CLAIMS & SCRATCHES

Horses claimed out of the race are listed along with horses scratched from the race with reasons when available.

COMMENTS

Race comments direct from the track handicapper when available.

ODDS & PAYOUTS

Official odds to $1 are provided for each horse. Information on some pari-mutuel payouts for each race when available.

Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.


























Unlimited Name Availability Searches



We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        National Pen Company has received 3.75 out of 5 stars based on 27 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
