Dr. Aaron Dishno at Work…
First I would like to thank everyone for the great feedback on the “Walk the Web” 3D Browsing site (http://3d.walktheweb.com). It has been most helpful in my journey. I took all of your comments to heart and have been neck deep in the next stage of creating the production quality version of my 3D Building Websites and 3D Internet Browsing concept.
Since I am taking you along for the ride, I thought I would share with you some of the exciting project advancements.
First, I am integrating my prototype work and concept with a popular 3D Gaming engine. What this means to you is that the next version of 3D Building Websites will have HD quality graphics, smooth action, and full support for all devices including cell phones, touch screens, and tablets. You will be able to “Walk the Web” in 3D on any device as easy as playing a game, yet interact with the 3D Building Websites just like traditional browsing the internet (with a twist in 3D!).
Second, in the spring quarter at La Sierra University I will be teaching a new course in web programming! The course is titled, “Techniques and Technologies for Client-Side and Server-Side Web Programming”. This class was created in response to my demo of my 3D Internet Browsing invention. I have been given freedom to write the syllabus and select the book(s) and have been told that I can integrate my 3D project into the course. This will be a real opportunity for upcoming web programmers to dive into something new and be part of the creation of the 3D Internet. Needless to say, if I spot talent, there is a good chance you could have a future with HTTP3D Inc.  It is just a teaser for now, but more information will come after I create the syllabus.
Stick with me and I promise to deliver an excellent quality product for 3D Building Websites and 3D Internet Browsing. It is time to “Walk the Web!” (Read more about it at http://www.walktheweb.com)







My Passion to Change the World

I Can’t do it Alone
Do you have a work passion in life? Something that just feels like it is the epitome of your existence? Well… I am fortunate enough that I know mine. It is so powerful that it keeps me awake at night and takes me out of my comfort zone often. I know I must do whatever it takes (keeping it legal of course). Basically, the need to act is greater than the fear of failure. Can you relate?
Change the World
My passion is to invent and right now I can be the person that brings 3D Internet Browsing to the world. I have worked hard all of my life; 24 years in school and even more years working in computers. It all comes down to this, the program works, but it will take much more help to make the business work.
First the good:

The idea is sound and the patents and trademarks are filed. Legally, I am doing whatever it takes.
Everything I can imagine to try has passed my proof-of-concept testing. The current technology is fully capable of doing what I desire.
I am Partnering with La Sierra University Computer Science Department. This will help me find and train teams of programmers to perfect 3D Internet Browsing.
We implemented Cloud technology, which is working great for the current hosted websites and will meet any future need.
People that see a live demo really like it and can understand the potential.

Now the challenges:

The PCT world-wide patent gives you 30 months to negotiate patents in as many countries as you would like and the clock is ticking. This costs thousands of dollars. (The USA patent is a separate legal filing already pending).
The 3D rendering is great for Internet, not as great when compared to the latest video games. I need time and additional programmers to continue developing the product quickly.
I need an exceptional demo of a virtual 3D City that will help people experience my vision of 3D Internet Browsing.
My other job is paying for everything at this time, but it takes 40 hours a week off this project.

Blind Courage

adishno, Blind Courage, help, i cant do it alone 


Karen Marie
A couple weeks ago I was in a stall at the yacht club restroom when I heard an older man and woman entering the rest room.  She was saying the doors are on your right. As he tested the door to the stall I was in, I said, “almost there, go one more door down”. After hearing me, he told his wife, “someone is in here, I’ll figure it out”, and she closed the rest room door. I heard him find the door and find the handicapped hand rail on the wall when he said, “oh nice, a handicap stall”.
When I came out of the stall, I saw a bold yet wandering man standing in the center of the room working his way to the sink area, so I offered an arm to guide him. We washed our hands as I gave a narrative of soap and towel placement. We introduced ourselves and conversed. I learned he had been blind since birth. I could feel the sense of excitement and adventure in his voice as he explained how he had arrived to this location.
While this was taking place, Karen had met his wife in the hall outside and was reassuring her that her husband is in good hands running into me as they heard our voices through the door.
I escorted him outside as we all joined in conversation.  It turns out that they had arrived to the yacht club by kayak and since she didn’t bring shoes, he gave her his socks from under his sandals!
As I think back on that day, I think of the courage of a blind man on a kayak, out on the water, going to new places, and boldly walking into the center of a rest room to find a sink. They did not plan each step, shoeless at the club, but improvised and made it all work. They didn’t expect help, but welcomed it.
i have been working on this project for some time now. Recently I became aware that I needed to lower my shields and grow my internet, social network image if I am to get people to follow me and my new ideas. People hear ideas but follow leaders. (Seven years completing my doctorate in leadership speaking there! Haha)
Meeting a blind man and seeing his courage may have encouraged me to take chances. Following that weekend, I started working on videos to explain the project and 3D technology in my designs. I know I have a lot to learn about video camera settings, staging, relaxing,and filming. But, I proudly published the first video in all of its imperfection. Maybe you will see more personality in my next video if I just hit record and post the results.
I am sure I will get better at it. I have courage.







Social Networks – Search Engine Optimization

flickr – Social Media
Interesting thing… I am trying to take a common phrase “Walk the Web” to search engines and make it mine! So here comes the study on Search Engine Optimization.
First, on my web pages I had created as much supportive content as possible, changed meta tags, page titles, etc… Then I tried to register the name in as many social networks as possible, because it appears that the social network user names are commonly listed in the search results (and not to mention the ownership or partnerships tend to marry the search engine to the user databases of social networks). Sometimes the name “Walk the Web” is not available so I had to go with variations such as “WalkTheWeb” and “WalkTheWeb3D”. In addition, I have ADishno, HTTP3D, and HTTP3DInc as some of my social network names before this effort.
So, now “WalkTheWeb”, “HTTP3D Inc”, and “ADishno” all have good responses in the search engines and each time I have something to post, I post it in approximately 20 social media websites (well, me and a couple others assisting now). Some day I might have to have a contest to see who is following me on the most networks (excluding my supportive wife Karen of course)!
So I have to keep working to get “Walk the Web” and “HTTP3D” to show higher.
The good news is that if you find any one of my sites (web or social network sites) they tend to all be connected and point to the others with links. Maybe it is time to become a Wiki writer, it has to be easier than my dissertation!







My First YouTube Video – ish…

I have been in videos, and I am sure some are posted on the internet, but today was the first time I tried to produce my own information video about my work.  I bough a tripod, set up my Panasonic 50X zoom camera, bought a light, then set up the scene in my living room. I then wrote some notes on a white board, moved around the light, and began testing the video scene. First thing I knew was that I had to shut off the noisy air conditioning and fan to make the sound clear. As you imagine on a day over 100 degrees, the room temperature shot up as I attempted to record the message. As sweat rolled in my eyes, the 12th attempt was pretty good run through, so I decided to call it a wrap and publish the video. Room for improvement? of course! But the first video is published, one of many.

Learning experiences? Well… better lighting would allow me to meet the screen brightness and then it wont look like I am in the dark… would be a good start. Also, if I have a cable to copy the files off the video camera, then I do not have to store it on SD ram, which only let me set the video resolution to a lesser degree. So… yes, it will get better. But overall, I feel it was a good experience and a relief to get the first one done. Thanks for reading!

In December 2016 I had a sturdy job as webmaster making over $100,000 a year with San Bernardino County and a second job as an adjunct professor at La Sierra University. My wife, Karen, had a well-paying position as a Special Education Teacher at a school district. We lived in a three-bedroom, two-bath house in the Inland Empire. We enjoyed weekends on a 30 foot sailboat. We are a highly educated couple with a doctorate, master degree, and multiple teaching credentials. So, why change anything? Time for a mid-life crisis? No, it didn’t quite happen that way.
My grade-school years were possibly the last time I remember the same complacent feeling in my gut. In a way, coasting through life, carefree, and having the feeling of mastering my own existence of radio control planes, boy scouts, playing trumpet, and school. It was right before 6th grade started, August 1979, when I received my wake-up call, well, a phone call that shook my existence. David Mraz, a playground friend and classmate had passed away from a brain aneurysm while swimming in a pool. A real wake-up call. I was 11 years old when I discovered my life was not a guarantee. I think I have been seriously committed to everything I do ever since.
The rest of my childhood was the product of aerospace. My dad, Bill, worked for a number of aerospace and manufacturing companies. When a contract ended, people were laid-off, and we moved to the next town, state, and job. Picture my mom, Bee, in a full-size Dodge van with five kids and a German Shepard dog, while my dad drove across the country. It is kind of a blur in my memory, but I think I attended eight different schools over the next six years. Since then, I have been incapable of coasting through life. Change became my norm. Accomplishment became my milestones. Ironically, I am not competitive with others. It is much worse, I am competitive with myself and keep raising the bar.
Mom Maggie and her friend at the nursing home, Eugenia
Skip forward to November 2016, mom Maggie lost her battle with ALS. To the end she fought for respect and dignity for everyone in the nursing home. She believed in me and I admire her courage and voice for others. I can’t let her down. My family believes in me. My wife believes in me. I believe in me. But it wasn’t until I felt the reminder of how fragile life is and no guarantee of tomorrow, that I decided I could not wait another day. I had to make a change now. Whatever amount of time I am given on this Earth I have to use to make a difference. I believe I can change the world for the better. Optimistically, I believe that people will embrace it.


 If people will embrace 3D Browsing and our concept of 3D Buildings and 3D Communities, we can make the money needed to help so many people with ALS, homelessness, mental illness, addiction, and nursing home quality of life. These diseases and conditions affect everyone and the people closest to us. 
So I pictured where I want to be in a few years… Staying at the County job wasn’t going to get it done. Up to now, I had helped myself and now it is more important to me to help others. I can use my talents to make the money and help others. Don’t get me wrong, I want to make a lot of money to take care of me, my family, and my investors that put their faith in me!
By the time I asked my wife Karen about making a change and giving this business a fair shot, she could see in my eyes and heart that I no longer had a decision to make. It had been made for me, by the deepest part of me. Without hesitation, she once again put her trust in me and said yes.
Now, at the end of March 2017, We survived the change, put our stakes in the ground in San Diego, staying on our sailboat, opened an office, and working full-time for HTTP3D Inc. and WalkTheWeb.com 3D Browsing.
Some family and friend investors got us in the office, but we need your help to get the word out: Please try 3D Browsing at walktheweb.com and please contact me if you or someone you know would like a 3D Building website! They are great for businesses and organizations, and can draw more attention to your traditional websites. With your help, 3D Browsing will be the future of the internet!
Thank you for your continuous support,

Once Again I am Inspired

Admiration, Drive, Inspiration, Success 


Five years of working on a 3D project for no pay, while working full-time, sleepless nights, working evenings and weekends, and trying to find family time … following seven years of a doctorate dissertation project with the same dedicated passion and drive to completion. Insane? Some may think so, but I asked myself, why do I do it? Here is one good reason.
Several years ago my wife Karen and I were visiting my mother-in-law Maggie and her husband Ray. We were sitting on their front porch in Maine discussing movies, when Maggie mentioned seeing the movie “The Social Network”. She knew I was a programmer and was always working on something. I will always remember her words (in a Maine accent), “Aaron you’re smartah than that guy, why don’t you come up with something bettah and make millions. I know you can do it.” Little did she know I already started on an inspiring idea about 3D Internet Browsing. 
Maggie and Karen telling stories
Since that day, every time I get frustrated about slow development progress or the tunnel to completion getting longer, I turn on the movie “The Social Network”, take a couple deep breaths, and get back to work. I have seen it so many times that I rarely look at the screen and just know it is on in the room while I program. So thank you Mark Zuckerberg and the cast of the movie. You and Maggie have inspired me.
Now there is a new chapter in my admiration and inspiration from Maggie, at 78 years old has ALS and is fighting for her life. Recently, Karen and I were fortunate enough to be able to fly to Maine and spend some time with her at the nursing home. Once again, I am inspired by Maggie. At first glance, I saw a lady in a power wheelchair fighting sclerosis in her legs. Seconds later, the wheelchair fades from view as her warm smile and caring eyes overtake the room. While we try to find out how she is doing, all she wants to talk about is how we are doing! By the end of the visit and all challenges considered, I can say that she is doing well. Maggie shared with us dozens of old family photos dating back to the Civil War as she named almost everyone in each photo. She spends her time visiting other patients, knows everyone by name including the regular visitors, and even got reprimanded by the therapist for putting her wheelchair in power level 2 (P2) and zooming past her door! P2 is for outside only! She has touched so many lives. 
I understand how she will be remembered and loved by many people. Now I will push play on “The Social Network” and get back to work! 







4 and 7 Year old Children Walk the Web!

This past weekend, two of my grandkids came over for a visit. As those of you that know me can guess, I was working on my Walk the Web 3D Browsing program. The 7 year-old, Tommie Jr., came over to me and asked what I was doing. So I handed him the mouse and within 15 seconds of instructions he was zooming all over the place. I thought this would be a good way to share how easy it is to use, so I asked Tommie Jr. if he would teach everyone how to Walk the Web with a mouse.

Like the amateur cameraman I am, I cut off the video seconds too soon when Tommie Jr. ended with, “You are very welcome!”.  I couldn’t smile any bigger!
Not to be outdone by his big brother, 4 year-old Christopher decided he wanted to give it a try. We started with a video for Keyboard and ended with a short video for Touch Screen. and once again, minutes after I completed taping, Christopher said, “this is a fun game!”.
Tommie Jr. definitely had more experience with a mouse, and Christopher actually had problems with using the mouse. His hands were too small to hold down the first mouse button and move the mouse with the trackball type mouse I use, so he was doing a two hand attempt. But when it came to the keyboard and touch screen, he had no problem. See for yourself:


It was a fun weekend. Thanks to Tommie Jr. and Christopher for showing us how easy it is to Walk the Web – 3D Browsing.







3D Browsing: Not a Game?

3D Browsing, 3D Building Websites, adishno, change the world, HTTP3D, Pan and Walk, Walk the Web 


3D Browsing may look like a game,  but don’t be fooled by appearance. Behind the scenes it is an HTML 5 website that brings together many of the latest programming techniques like partial page postbacks, iframes, canvas animation, touch controls, and css layers.
On traditional webpages, you click a link and the browser goes blank, the new page loads, then you see the results.
In 3D Browsing, as you walk towards a 3D Building it triggers the browser to go get more information – like clicking a link and opening a new webpage – the biggest difference is I keep the animation going continuously in the foreground as the information is then loaded and added to your current view all behind the scenes. To see it in action, go to https://3d.walktheweb.com. as you walk towards the 3D Building you will see all of the contents of the 3D Building load. Walking is done by mouse, keyboard, or touch screen and works on desktops, tablets, and smart devices as long as they support HTML 5 (which is most devices today).
3D Browsing: Loading and Unloading 3D Building Content as you walk!
If you back away from the 3D Building you will see the contents of the 3D Building disappear. This same thing happens to full 3D Buildings as you walk down the street.
Another feature in this demonstration is the ability to link to traditional web pages. For example, click on the billboard. Web pages can open in their own window or in an iframe in front of the 3D Browsing view. Then, try the video in the building – move around while it plays! I have already tested many other web objects like forms (text boxes, check boxes, file uploads, buttons, etc), scroll-bars, sound, and avatars with different chase camera views. I will make them available soon!
Finally, this web server is the first of its kind hosting 3D Building Websites, but it is designed to be hosted on other servers and interconnect 3D Buildings into 3D Communities all over the internet. So stay tuned… it is just the beginning of 3D Browsing.

I Can’t do it Alone
Do you have a work passion in life? Something that just feels like it is the epitome of your existence? Well… I am fortunate enough that I know mine. It is so powerful that it keeps me awake at night and takes me out of my comfort zone often. I know I must do whatever it takes (keeping it legal of course). Basically, the need to act is greater than the fear of failure. Can you relate?
Change the World
My passion is to invent and right now I can be the person that brings 3D Internet Browsing to the world. I have worked hard all of my life; 24 years in school and even more years working in computers. It all comes down to this, the program works, but it will take much more help to make the business work.
First the good:

The idea is sound and the patents and trademarks are filed. Legally, I am doing whatever it takes.

People that see a live demo really like it and can understand the potential.

Now the challenges:

The PCT world-wide patent gives you 30 months to negotiate patents in as many countries as you would like and the clock is ticking. This costs thousands of dollars. (The USA patent is a separate legal filing already pending).
The 3D rendering is great for Internet, not as great when compared to the latest video games. I need time and additional programmers to continue developing the product quickly.
I need an exceptional demo of a virtual 3D City that will help people experience my vision of 3D Internet Browsing.
My other job is paying for everything at this time, but it takes 40 hours a week off this project.
