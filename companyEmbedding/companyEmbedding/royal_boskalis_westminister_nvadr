History[edit]
Boskalis (Bos & Kalis) was founded as Johannes Kraaijeveld en van Noordenne in 1910 by Johannes Kraaijeveld and Elizabeth van Noordenne. In the thirties it was renamed NV Baggermaatschappij Bos & Kalis when Gerrit Jan Bos, Wilhelm Bos, Egbertus Dingeman Kalis and Kobus Kalis took over. In between the two wars, Boskalis contributed to the Zuiderzee project. The company inked a contract in 1931 for the dredging of Bromborough Dock. In 1933, Boskalis partnered with the Westminster Dredging Company (based in Fareham, England, which opened business opportunities with West Africa.
Boskalis became a public company in 1970.[4] Boskalis received the designation "Royal" in 1978.[5]
In the 1980s economic and political circumstances forced Boskalis to concentrate on its core dredging business.[6]
More acquisitions followed in the 1990s. It also acquired a 40% interest in Archirodon Group.[7] During this period Boskalis was also involved in several major land reclamation projects. In Hong Kong the company worked on the major land reclamation project for the new Chek Lap Kok airport [6] and in Singapore it cooperated on a multi-year development program.[8]
In 2007 the company was engaged in two major contracts in Australia — a €300 million contract to deepen the shipping channels of Port Phillip in Melbourne, utilising its dredge the Queen of the Netherlands, and a €50 million contract to expand the harbour at Newcastle.[9][10] The company is also involved in a €1.1 billion contract to develop a new port in Abu Dhabi.[9]
On 15 September 2008 Boskalis offered €1.11 billion for fellow Dutch maritime company Smit International.[11] Despite the offer being promptly rejected by Smit's board, Boskalis subsequently built a stake of over 25% in the firm[12] and expressed a continuing desire to buy a number of its business units.[13] A revised offer of €1.35 billion was accepted by Smit in January 2010, with Boskalis declaring its offer unconditional that March.[14]
In 2011 Boskalis acquired MNO Vervat in The Netherlands.[15] Boskalis has around 15,600 employees, including their share in partner companies. They operate in over 75 countries across six continents, with a fleet that consists of over 1,100 vessels and equipment. Boskalis is accused of bribing Mauritian politicians to obtain the contract to dredge the Canal Anglais.[16]
In 2013, Boskalis acquired Dockwise, a heavy marine transport company.

History[edit]
Boskalis (Bos & Kalis) was founded as Johannes Kraaijeveld en van Noordenne in 1910 by Johannes Kraaijeveld and Elizabeth van Noordenne. In the thirties it was renamed NV Baggermaatschappij Bos & Kalis when Gerrit Jan Bos, Wilhelm Bos, Egbertus Dingeman Kalis and Kobus Kalis took over. In between the two wars, Boskalis contributed to the Zuiderzee project. The company inked a contract in 1931 for the dredging of Bromborough Dock. In 1933, Boskalis partnered with the Westminster Dredging Company (based in Fareham, England, which opened business opportunities with West Africa.
Boskalis became a public company in 1970.[4] Boskalis received the designation "Royal" in 1978.[5]
In the 1980s economic and political circumstances forced Boskalis to concentrate on its core dredging business.[6]
More acquisitions followed in the 1990s. It also acquired a 40% interest in Archirodon Group.[7] During this period Boskalis was also involved in several major land reclamation projects. In Hong Kong the company worked on the major land reclamation project for the new Chek Lap Kok airport [6] and in Singapore it cooperated on a multi-year development program.[8]
In 2007 the company was engaged in two major contracts in Australia — a €300 million contract to deepen the shipping channels of Port Phillip in Melbourne, utilising its dredge the Queen of the Netherlands, and a €50 million contract to expand the harbour at Newcastle.[9][10] The company is also involved in a €1.1 billion contract to develop a new port in Abu Dhabi.[9]
On 15 September 2008 Boskalis offered €1.11 billion for fellow Dutch maritime company Smit International.[11] Despite the offer being promptly rejected by Smit's board, Boskalis subsequently built a stake of over 25% in the firm[12] and expressed a continuing desire to buy a number of its business units.[13] A revised offer of €1.35 billion was accepted by Smit in January 2010, with Boskalis declaring its offer unconditional that March.[14]
In 2011 Boskalis acquired MNO Vervat in The Netherlands.[15] Boskalis has around 15,600 employees, including their share in partner companies. They operate in over 75 countries across six continents, with a fleet that consists of over 1,100 vessels and equipment. Boskalis is accused of bribing Mauritian politicians to obtain the contract to dredge the Canal Anglais.[16]
In 2013, Boskalis acquired Dockwise, a heavy marine transport company.

History[edit]
Boskalis (Bos & Kalis) was founded as Johannes Kraaijeveld en van Noordenne in 1910 by Johannes Kraaijeveld and Elizabeth van Noordenne. In the thirties it was renamed NV Baggermaatschappij Bos & Kalis when Gerrit Jan Bos, Wilhelm Bos, Egbertus Dingeman Kalis and Kobus Kalis took over. In between the two wars, Boskalis contributed to the Zuiderzee project. The company inked a contract in 1931 for the dredging of Bromborough Dock. In 1933, Boskalis partnered with the Westminster Dredging Company (based in Fareham, England, which opened business opportunities with West Africa.
Boskalis became a public company in 1970.[4] Boskalis received the designation "Royal" in 1978.[5]
In the 1980s economic and political circumstances forced Boskalis to concentrate on its core dredging business.[6]
More acquisitions followed in the 1990s. It also acquired a 40% interest in Archirodon Group.[7] During this period Boskalis was also involved in several major land reclamation projects. In Hong Kong the company worked on the major land reclamation project for the new Chek Lap Kok airport [6] and in Singapore it cooperated on a multi-year development program.[8]
In 2007 the company was engaged in two major contracts in Australia — a €300 million contract to deepen the shipping channels of Port Phillip in Melbourne, utilising its dredge the Queen of the Netherlands, and a €50 million contract to expand the harbour at Newcastle.[9][10] The company is also involved in a €1.1 billion contract to develop a new port in Abu Dhabi.[9]
On 15 September 2008 Boskalis offered €1.11 billion for fellow Dutch maritime company Smit International.[11] Despite the offer being promptly rejected by Smit's board, Boskalis subsequently built a stake of over 25% in the firm[12] and expressed a continuing desire to buy a number of its business units.[13] A revised offer of €1.35 billion was accepted by Smit in January 2010, with Boskalis declaring its offer unconditional that March.[14]
In 2011 Boskalis acquired MNO Vervat in The Netherlands.[15] Boskalis has around 15,600 employees, including their share in partner companies. They operate in over 75 countries across six continents, with a fleet that consists of over 1,100 vessels and equipment. Boskalis is accused of bribing Mauritian politicians to obtain the contract to dredge the Canal Anglais.[16]
In 2013, Boskalis acquired Dockwise, a heavy marine transport company.

Japan slaps 50% tariff on U.S. frozen beef, first such action in 14 years
              
              Japan said Friday it would impose a temporary 50% tariff on frozen beef from the U.S. and several other countries, a move that could inflame trade tensions, although Tokyo officials described it as a required response to a recent surge in imports.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.
