Company Description (as filed with the SEC)
Real Industry, Inc. ("Real Industry," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") is a
Delaware holding company that operates through its subsidiaries. Our current
business focus is supporting the performance of Real Alloy, a global leader in
aluminum recycling and our single largest operating business today, and to make
acquisitions of additional operating companies. We seek to acquire meaningful
ownership stakes in businesses with talented and experienced management teams,
strong customer relationships, and sustainable competitive advantages. We
regularly consider acquisitions of businesses that operate in undervalued
industries, as well as businesses that we believe are in transition or are
otherwise misunderstood by the marketplace. After such acquisitions, we expect
to operate our businesses as autonomous subsidiaries, as we do with Real Alloy.  ... More ...

Acquisitions




Overview


Net Operating Loss Carry Forwards


Partnering With Real Industry 






Real Industry, Inc. is seeking to invest its capital in large, well-managed and consistently profitable businesses concentrated primarily in the United States industrial and commercial marketplace.
 

General Investment Criteria

Business consistently producing pre-tax income of $25–$75 million
Sustainable competitive advantage that can be maintained long-term
Proven management teams with the ability to operate with relative autonomy
Industry agnostic



Structure

Real Industry must own 80.1% or more of a business
Flexible approach with seller on deal consideration, including potentially using Real Industry common stock



Target Situations

High-margin businesses with low ongoing capital expenditure needs
Businesses with modest to low growth; consistency is more important
Industries or sectors where Real Industry can serve as a platform for growth via additional acquisitions/consolidation
Legacy private equity or hedge fund holding seeking an exit
Family businesses
Companies with limited or declining tax deductions
Carve-outs of non-core divisions of larger enterprises







Real Industry has substantial Federal NOLs that were predominately amassed from the legacy business of Fremont General and do not begin to expire until 2027. These NOLs may provide benefits to the Company as well as the businesses that are acquired. Management is focused to ensure the NOLs are preserved and available in future periods.
 
General characteristics

Real Industry has no Section 382 limitation on annual usage of its Federal NOLs
There are no restrictions with regard to line of business
Real Industry has bylaws in place that prohibit stockholders from accumulating more than a 5% interest, without Company approval

When selecting a firm to sell a company to or partner with, the right fit is important.  Pricing is a key element in the decision process but other factors must be considered. Real Industry offers many unique and positive attributes that improve the probability that the transaction will close as scheduled with positive long-term benefits.

With the exception of the Operations Committee, all committees are composed exclusively of independent directors.  The Audit Committee must also satisfy an additional Securities and Exchange Commission independence requirement, which provides that they may not accept directly or indirectly any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from Real Industry or any of its subsidiaries other than their directors' compensation, or otherwise be an "affiliated person" of the Company. The Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee satisfy the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission independence requirements.
