Retirement Planning 



    	We know you're worried about whether you'll be able to build and sustain the retirement of your dreams and we can help. Our innovative retirement planning program shows you how to rest easy, knowing you've found the answers to the following four questions :	
    





How should I build my retirement account?
When can I retire?
How much money will I need in retirement?
How can I make my money last for my whole life?

We begin with a budget, which includes a careful analysis of assets and spending habits. We gather documents including pay stubs, qualified and non-qualified retirement accounts, beneficiary designations, cash flow, cost basis information, insurance policies, employer sponsored retirement plan information, educational accounts and more. We consider the taxable implications of every phase, from accumulation to withdrawal.
Our retirement analysis includes an evaluation of income flows from pensions, retirement assets and Social Security. Our Social Security analyzer lets you know the optimal time for you to begin taking your Social Security payments. We’ll work with you to set up a safe withdrawal plan, and to assess your risk management requirements.

Market Commentary 








Market Summary
For the week ending 7-21-17
Stocks recorded modest gains for the week, with every major benchmark except the Dow Jones Industrial Average reaching new highs. The NASDAQ performed best, helped by a better-than-expected earnings report from Netflix.
Trading activity was light throughout most of the week, despite a heavy earnings calendar.  Roughly one-fifth of companies in the S&P 500 index have released second-quarter earnings so far and the pace of earnings growth is running ahead of expectations.  According to FactSet, the “blended” earnings growth stands at 7.2%, compared with analyst’s expectations of 6.6% when reporting began.  “Blended” earnings is a combination of actual earnings for those companies who have reported together with the latest estimated earnings for those companies who have yet to report.  Earnings strength has been a driver of the market’s gains so far this year, helping to counteract some of the high price-to-earnings ratios that have plagued the market over the past few years.
Strength in the global economy, along with hopes for improved growth in the U.S., has also been a factor driving gains. The previous week brought disappointing news on this front, with the release of soft U.S. inflation and retail sales data, but this week’s data is somewhat more encouraging.  In particular, housing starts rose 8.3% in June and permits for future construction rose 7.4%.  Weekly initial claims for unemployment benefits fell 13,000 to 233,000, signaling continued strength in the labor market.
A midweek rally in oil prices helped energy stocks.
The upcoming week will be one of the heaviest of this earnings season and, based on what we’ve seen so far, we are expecting the market to react favorably.  Tech stocks are in focus with Google, Amazon and Facebook all reporting over the course of the week.
For the week the Dow Jones fell 54 points to 21,580 (-0.2%);  The NASDAQ rose 76 points to 6,388 (1.2%); and the S&P 500 added 14 points to 2,473 (0.6%)
Oil was unchanged at $46.50/bbl.    Gold was up $18 to 1,255/oz.
The yield on the 10 yr. treasury fell slightly to 2.2%

Education Planning - Winch Financial

Education Planning 



    	The cost of education has been rising dramatically in recent years, leading many college students to graduate with the enormous burden of massive loans. As a percentage of household debt, student debt has climbed to 10%. That’s an increase of more than three times in just 10 years. Careful planning can mitigate this alarming trend.	
    




Thanks to nearly four decades of experience in education planning, we can offer you intelligent options and help you choose the right vehicle for your education account. We’ll take the time to consider your family’s educational funding needs, available assets and time horizon and develop a unique plan for you using one or more of the following options:
529 Plan
To set up a college savings account, we recommend a 529 Plan, but we encourage parents to research the options available to them within the plan. Most states offer plans with age-based allocation options, but the administration options vary from state to state and not all plans offer a guaranteed rate of return.
The advantage of a 529 plan is that the money grows tax free, it is “qualified” for educational purposes; in most cases this means tuition, room, board, books, travel and school supplies. Most of these plans have very low minimum contributions.
Assets from a 529 plan are protected from bankruptcy.
Educational Savings Account (Coverdell)
Another option for those investors who want a little more control over their account is an educational savings account. The benefits of this account depend entirely on the income levels of the contributor. For anyone seeking financial aid, however, colleges consider assets in one of these accounts the student’s and not the parents’, which reduces the student’s eligibility for aid.
There is an annual contribution limit of $2,000 per beneficiary and parents who exceed income limits are not permitted to make contributions. The money in the account grows tax free and withdrawals for educational purposes are tax-free up to a limit determined by the beneficiary’s qualified status (income level).
Roth IRA
A third excellent option, again depending upon your income levels, is to set up a Roth IRA account for educational purposes, which will not affect the student’s ability to receive financial aid. These accounts offer a wider range of investment options and parents or grandparents can contribute up to $5,500 annually ($6500 if aged 50 or over) to a Roth IRA. A child working for his or her parents also can set up a Roth IRA. Contributions are not tax-deductible, but the investments grow tax deferred and are tax free when taken out. These withdrawals can be used to fund a child or grandchild’s education. If not needed, contributors are that much more prepared for retirement.
At Winch Financial, we advocate education for personal growth and expanded horizons, and understand that a comprehensive and conscientious discussion of your options will help you reach your goals.  We look forward to assisting you with strategic education planning.
