FLAME OF
KNOWLEDGE





Decatur Capital Management, formerly Cornerstone Asset Management, is an employee-owned, SEC-registered investment advisory firm.  The firm was founded by Degas A. Wright, CFA and Ralph J. Bryant, CPA and began operations in 2000.
The genesis for the firm actually began several years earlier.  While serving as treasurer for the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) and a member of MARTA’s pension committee, Degas was curious about drivers of the market.  As many of the investment managers he met with could not provide satisfactory answers to his questions, he began in earnest to research the market.  After several years and many late nights, Degas developed an investment thesis. However, without any direct investment industry experience, it was not clear how he could he start an investment firm.
At the same time, Ralph was managing an accounting practice.  Ralph had worked with Degas at a consulting firm in the early 1990’s, and Ralph and Degas had developed a friendship over the years. Naturally, Degas turned to Ralph for advice on establishing a business. Degas and Ralph soon realized that with their combined skills, expanding Ralph’s accounting practice into asset management was a logical step.
By building upon the success of Ralph’s accounting practice, Degas could now launch the asset management firm that he had envisioned.  Degas’s and Ralph’s first office space was 550 square feet with two small offices in a walk-up two story condominium office building.  Thus, in June 2000, with zero assets under management and at the height of the technology bubble, Cornerstone Asset Management began operations.
Ralph deftly managed the firm’s finances, while Degas worked on the investment thesis and developed the firm’s quantitative approach to evaluating a firm’s fundamental ratios and potential for stock price appreciation. The term ‘lean’ is far too generous to describe the early years. Based on their unwavering faith, though, Ralph and Degas eked out an existence from accounting assignments and consulting work. Then the tech bubble popped!
At the time, Degas was convinced that the firm’s quantitative approach would work even in a declining market.  He shared with several prospects the firm’s investment approach.  In March 2002, Decatur Capital Management began managing its first institutional client.
Since that first institutional client, the firm went through a name change and moved its offices.  In 2005, the firm was starting to get calls from consultants who were interested in the firm’s strong investment performance.  The problem was that the consultants would often ask whether or not the firm was affiliated with some other ‘Cornerstone’ capital.  The partners soon discovered that there were 70 plus other ‘Cornerstone’ SEC registered investment advisory firms across the U.S. As it is difficult enough to stand out in the industry, the firm did not need to confuse consultants and potential clients with a common name.  The principals researched various names and, based on the advice of a trusted friend of the firm, decided on Decatur Capital.  After all, Decatur is where the principals raised their families; it is home.  The firm registered Decatur Capital Management with the SEC in January 2006.
Looking back, Ralph, Degas, and Decatur Capital have been mentored and guided by many friends and supporters in the industry. They are truly grateful for the unselfish assistance they have received over the years.  They believe they have an obligation to pass on this generosity.

Large Cap Growth StrategyMid Cap Growth Strategy



Portfolio Inception Date:March, 2002Lead Portfolio ManagerDegas A. Wright, CFA

Large Cap Growth Strategy
DCM’s  Large Cap Growth portfolio consists of 40–60 stocks with market capitalizations greater than $5 billion.  The top ten positions, by weight, will range between 30-45% of the portfolio. 
As a policy limit, the cash position will not exceed 5%.
Performance Benchmark
The Russell 1000 Growth index is the primary performance benchmark.
Investment Objectives
The portfolio’s (net of fees) return is expected to exceed the Russell 1000 Growth Index over a full market cycle, which we  define as a rolling five-year period. 
Investment Philosophy & Process
The essence of the Large Cap Growth philosophy and process is to find companies whose earnings and EPS are accelerating. The investment philosophy is earnings-centric, with an emphasis on  positive EPS estimate revisions, accelerating EPS momentum, and consistent EPS surprises. As we search for companies with accelerating earnings momentum, we believe that EPS estimate revisions and EPS surprises (relative to consensus estimates) are among the most unbiased “signaling devices” in equity markets, The empirical and academic evidence clearly validates the thesis that the best performing stocks are those with superior earnings momentum, and our analytical approach allows us to identify the best earnings growth stories in the 
									large cap universe.
Subsequently, our sector leaders perform rigorous analysis of financial statements, with a primary focus on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. This careful analysis attempts to gauge whether the company possesses a reasonable debt/capitalization profile, an efficient working capital management strategy, improving cash-on-cash returns, and a rational cash flow utilization.. We also stress-test the strength of debt coverage ratios and analyze debt repayment schedules to avoid refinancing crunches and liquidity mismatches. Finally, we check for accounting integrity by cross-checking operating CFs with reported EPS to ascertain whether accounting earnings are consistent with cash generation.

WE QUANTIFY
THE FUNDAMENTALS





Core Philosophy
All of our investment strategies rest on a common philosophy that portfolio outperformance is generated by:

Transforming both proprietary and academic research into investment strategies that adapt to ever-changing capital markets
Creating an initial buy list through proprietary multi-factor models
Integrating sophisticated quantitative research with careful fundamental analysis.

								Ultimately, we believe that disciplined investing drives portfolio alpha.


Process
More so than growth investors, we prefer to characterize our style as earnings-cycle investors.  Our investment process is designed to identify companies displaying above-average and sustainable earnings momentum. Based on in-house and academic research, we believe that EPS estimate revisions and EPS surprises (relative to consensus estimates) are among the most unbiased âsignaling devicesâ in equity markets.
Our process begins by identifying promising stocks within the investment universe through proprietary multi-factor econometric models. Our models have been developed to, in essence, quantify the fundamentals.  Along with other key attributes, we search for firms with positive EPS estimate revisions, accelerating EPS momentum, and consistent EPS surprises. This first stage allows us to identify the best earnings growth stories in the relevant universe. 
The next step of the process focuses on the fundamentals. Our sector leaders perform rigorous analysis of financial statements, with a primary focus on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. This careful analysis attempts to gauge whether the company possesses a reasonable debt/capitalization profile, an efficient working capital management strategy, improving cash-on-cash returns, and a rational cash flow utilization. We also stress test the strength of debt coverage ratios and analyze debt repayment schedules to avoid refinancing crunches and liquidity mismatches. Finally, we check for accounting integrity by cross-checking operating CF with reported EPS to ascertain whether accounting earnings are consistent with cash generation. 
The last step of the process is portfolio construction.Our portfolios tend to be fairly sector neutral, with the over- or under-weighting of sectors driven by a set of proprietary multi-factor models that are similar to those used to select stocks for the initial buy list.  Risk control is also a key element of portfolio construction.  We closely monitor the key elements of our portfolios, such as tracking error, market cap distribution, and growth/value traits.
From start to finish, the overall process stresses discipline; however, we do not believe that disciplined investing means stagnant investing.  Good investors stick to their knitting but also recognize that the markets do change.  With the assistance of our academic advisory board, we are constantly evaluating the efficacy of our quantitative models, our fundamental analysis, and our portfolio construction techniques.  Our clients can rest assured, though, that as our techniques and analysis may evolve as the markets change, any change in our process is done in a disciplined manner, with extensive back-testing, statistical analysis, and robustness checks.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
