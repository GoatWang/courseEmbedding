Frequently asked questions (FAQs)










1. What is a Small Business HRA and what does it have to do with PeopleKeep?

A Small Business Health Reimbursement Arrangement (HRA) is a way for small businesses to give employees a monthly allowance to reimburse individual insurance and medical expenses. It's also known as the Qualfied Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA). The PeopleKeep platform makes it easy for businesses to set allowances and record reimbursements, and for employees to submit reimbursement requests. Click here to get your free guide to the Small Business HRA. 



2. Who can use PeopleKeep?

If your small business has fewer than 50 full-time employees and doesn’t offer another form of health insurance, you can use PeopleKeep. Full-time employees and their family members are eligible to use it, and businesses can choose to include part-time employees and their family members, too. There are no minimum participation requirements.




3. How much do companies need to budget for benefits?

The total cost is entirely in the company’s control. There are no minimum contribution rules, but there are annual federal limits of $4,950 per single employee and $10,000 per employee with a family.




4. Do all employees qualify for PeopleKeep?

Only W-2 employees are eligible for PeopleKeep. Spouses and children of employees can also have expenses reimbursed through PeopleKeep. 



5. What can be reimbursed through PeopleKeep?

PeopleKeep can reimburse employees and their families for policies purchased on the individual market and out-of-pocket medical expenses. For a full list of HRA eligible expenses, click here. 



6. How much time does it take to use PeopleKeep?

You can set up PeopleKeep within 30 minutes. After that, you’ll spend about five minutes a month managing your plan.




7. Does PeopleKeep take care of my compliance requirements?

Yes. PeopleKeep was developed according to the IRS tax code and medical privacy laws. Our experts ensure compliance by monitoring changes in health-care laws. All you need to do is keep your employee roster up to date and follow the steps to record reimbursements.

Automated Compliance







Comply with federal regulations.








Request a Demo



















ZaneHealth helps your company automatically comply with applicable regulations with built-in protections. 
The U.S. federal government has specific regulations that employers must comply with in order to reimburse employees for individual health insurance premiums without triggering ERISA, violating HIPAA-privacy rules, or violating federal income tax regulations. 
For example, all employee reimbursement requests are kept protected in compliance with HIPAA, and receipts are stored digitally as required by the IRS for audit purposes.







Our customers love this.

Taking Advantage of a Qualifying Life Event Under a QSEHRA

One of the biggest advantages of working for a company that offers a Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA) is the opportunity to get reimbursed for your individual insurance premiums. You don’t need an insurance policy to participate in the QSEHRA—or to be reimbursed for other eligible medical expenses—but having one is helpful. Besides the obvious advantages of being insured, having major medical coverage—or minimum essential coverage (MEC)—entitles you to tax-free reimbursement of all QSEHRA-eligible expenses. While it’s possible to get MEC in other ways (through a spouse’s group insurance policy, for example), many QSEHRA participants gain qualifying coverage through an individual insurance policy. If you don’t already have an individual insurance policy, you’ll need to purchase one and attest to that purchase to start getting tax-free reimbursement of your premium payments and other medical expenses. Unfortunately, simply becoming eligible for a QSEHRA doesn’t entitle you to a Special Enrollment Period (SEP). If your company implements a QSEHRA outside of the open enrollment period, you’ll need a qualifying life event to purchase an individual insurance policy. In this post, we’ll go over qualifying life events, how to verify them through your local exchange, and how to use that policy to access tax-free reimbursement through the QSEHRA.

Since the 21st Century Cures Act created the Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA) in December 2016, concerns have surfaced over whether certain state laws conflict with the new benefit.

What Is a Qualifying Life Event?

When the Affordable Care Act went into effect, it guaranteed that everyone who applied for individual health insurance would be approved for and enrolled in coverage. However, to prevent people from signing up for insurance only when they get sick, the ACA restricted enrollment to specific open enrollment periods—typically a period of three months from November to January.

How Medicare and Social Security Impact HSAs

Medicare and Social Security are two subjects complicated enough to give anyone a mental workout. However, it’s important for employers and employees alike to understand how Medicare and Social Security affect contributions to a health savings account (HSA). While the rules are actually quite straightforward, the penalties for making improper contributions are steep. Employees and employers should be informed to ensure they don’t inadvertently break the rules.

Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangements (QSEHRAs), sometimes called Small Business HRAs, are a popular benefit for companies looking to reimburse their employees for individual health insurance and medical expenses. A natural next question for business owners is "Can I get in on this?"  As with many IRS rules, the answer depends. In our new infographic, you can tell at a glance what kinds of business owners are or are not eligible to participate in the QSEHRA and when.

The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017—what’s in the Senate’s new bill to repeal and replace Obamacare?

After a month of closed-door meetings, Senate Republicans emerged last week with a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. The legislation, introduced as The Better Care Reconciliation Act of 2017 (BCRA), is the Senate’s answer to the American Health Care Act (H.R. 1628), which the House of Representatives passed on May 4.  The Senate bill preserves much of the House’s work while making some key changes that could influence the federal budget and the legislation’s overall chances of passage. For small businesses, the national discussion on health care policy has brought much uncertainty. Any changes will have a big impact on the realm of employee benefits.

How the AHCA Affects Small Business and Individual Taxation

Much has been said about the passage of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the House of Representatives in May. The Republican-sponsored legislation is the first successful attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and though it faces considerable scrutiny in the Senate, it signals a desire among many for significant change in U.S. health care policy. While the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) score on the AHCA discusses the impact of the legislation on the federal budget, the bill’s tax impact on individuals and small businesses—as well as those who advise them—has gone largely unexamined. Because the AHCA is a budget reconciliation bill (legislation that focuses solely on budgetary concerns), it contains many provisions that affect the tax status of these groups. It also raises several questions on IRS reporting requirements going forward.

Should I Still Offer the QSEHRA When Group Insurance Is Cheaper than Individual?

One of the chief benefits of offering a personalized benefits solution like the Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA), or Small Business HRA, is its potential to save small businesses money. Because the QSEHRA allows businesses to set their own budget on a per-employee basis, business owners can control costs – and, because individual insurance is almost always cheaper than group policies, small businesses often cover their employees’ entire premium while cutting expenses. But not all individual markets are the same. While covering an employee under a group policy is more expensive for most small businesses, there are several parts of the country where the individual market has deteriorated to the point that an individual policy is actually more costly. In these situations, does it still make sense to offer personalized benefits instead of a traditional group policy? In this post, we’ll explore how to determine whether the group or individual market is more favorable, when to explore options outside of group, and how to determine if a QSEHRA is the best fit, even if it’s more expensive.

I love working for a small business. In a smaller office, my day-to-day impact is much bigger, and when I wake up in the mornings, I know I’m going to make a difference. But health insurance is also important to me—and, unfortunately, quite a few small businesses don’t offer health benefits. For many years, that led to a hard choice: Join a larger company that offers benefits, or go without benefits to work for a small business. That’s not the case anymore. I now work for a small business that offers me a Qualified Small Employer Health Reimbursement Arrangement (QSEHRA), or Small Business HRA.

One of the central questions in reforming U.S. health care asks whether businesses should be required to provide health insurance to their employees. Right now, only companies with 50 or more employees are subject to the employer mandate. If plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act are successful, however, no business would have to provide health insurance.
