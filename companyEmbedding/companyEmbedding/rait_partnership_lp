RAIT's Ownership Approach:

Maximize value over time
Hedges against inflation
Adds stability to the asset mix





					RAIT invests directly, as an owner, in commercial real estate properties. Our portfolio consists of over $900 million of commercial real estate properties, with more than 3,000 apartment units and 6 million square feet of office, industrial and retail space. We believe owing hard assets, which deliver a recurring source of cash flow with the potential for appreciation, is an excellent hedge against inflation and adds stability to the RAIT portfolio.
