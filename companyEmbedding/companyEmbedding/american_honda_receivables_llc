valid sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables, enforceable
against creditors of and purchasers from the RPA Seller, and
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the RPA Seller
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability
may be subject to or limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,

enforcement of creditors’ rights in general and by general
principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforceability
shall be considered in a proceeding in equity or at law

 

(v)         
No Violation . The execution, delivery and performance by
the RPA Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the fulfillment of
the terms hereof shall not conflict with, result in any breach of

subject; nor result in the creation or imposition of any lien upon
any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such indenture,
agreement or other instrument (other than this Agreement); nor
violate any law or, to the knowledge of the RPA Seller, any order,
rule or regulation applicable to it or its properties of any court
or of any federal or state regulatory body, administrative agency
or other governmental instrumentality having jurisdiction over the
RPA Seller or any of its properties, in each case where any such
conflict, breach, default, lien or violation would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the RPA
Seller’s ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Basic
Documents.

 

(vi)        
No Proceedings . To the RPA Seller’s knowledge, there

Agreement, (ii) seeking to prevent the consummation of any of

All Filings Made . Both the RPA Seller and the Purchaser,
respectively, have caused or will have caused, or have taken or
will take, within ten (10) days of the Closing Date, all steps
necessary, including the filing of all appropriate financing
statements (including UCC filings) necessary in the appropriate
jurisdictions under the applicable law, to give the Issuer a first
priority perfected security interest in the Receivables (other than
the Related Security with respect thereto, to the extent that an
ownership interest therein cannot be perfected by the filing of a
financing statement), and to give the Indenture Trustee a first
priority perfected security interest therein.

 

(ix)         
Security Interest . This agreement creates a valid and
continuing security interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in
the Receivables in favor of the Purchaser, which is prior to all
other Liens (other than Permitted Liens and any Lien which will be
released prior to the assignment hereunder) and is enforceable
against all creditors of and purchasers from the RPA
Seller.

Purchaser and that the beneficial interest in and title to the
Receivables not be part of the debtor’s estate in the event

to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, (2) the sale by the
Purchaser to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing
Agreement and (3) the security interest granted by the Issuer to
the Indenture Trustee in the Indenture, no Receivable has been
sold, transferred, assigned or pledged by the RPA Seller to any
Person other than the Purchaser or by the Purchaser to any Person
other than the Issuer, and no Receivable has been sold,
transferred, assigned or pledged by the Issuer to any Person other
than the Indenture Trustee, and no provision of a Receivable shall
have been waived, except as provided in this Agreement. Immediately
prior to the transfer and assignment herein contemplated, the RPA
Seller has good and marketable title to each Receivable free and
clear of all Liens (except Permitted Liens and any Lien which will
be released prior to the sale and transfer of such Receivable to
the Issuer), and, immediately upon the transfer and assignment
contemplated herein, the Purchaser shall have good and marketable
title to each Receivable, free and clear of all Liens (except
Permitted Liens and any Lien which will be released prior to the
sale and transfer of such Receivable to the Issuer).

Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the RPA Seller as of
the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date that:

obligations under and consummate the transactions contemplated by
the Basic Documents.

 

(iii)

may be subject to or limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium, liquidation or other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights in general and
by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such
enforceability shall be considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law.

No Violation . The execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the fulfillment of the terms
hereof shall not conflict with, result in any breach of any of the
terms and provisions of, nor constitute (with or without notice or
lapse of time) a default under, the certificate of formation or
limited liability company agreement of the Purchaser, or conflict
with or breach any of the material terms or provisions of, or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time) a default
under, any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the
Purchaser is a party or by which it may be bound or any of its
properties are subject; nor result in the creation or imposition of

such indenture, agreement or other instrument (other than this
Agreement); nor, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, violate any law
or any order, rule or regulation applicable to it or its properties
of any court or of any federal or state regulatory body,
administrative agency or other governmental instrumentality having
jurisdiction over the Purchaser or any of its properties, in each
case where any such conflict, breach, default, lien or violation
would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Purchaser’s ability to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated by the Basic
Documents.

 

(vi)        
No Proceedings . To the Purchaser’s knowledge, there
are no proceedings or investigations pending or, to the knowledge
of the Purchaser, threatened against the Purchaser, before any
court, regulatory body, administrative agency or other tribunal or
governmental instrumentality (i) asserting the invalidity of this
Agreement, (ii) seeking to prevent the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (iii) seeking any
determination or ruling that, in the reasonable judgment of the
Purchaser, would materially and adversely affect the performance by

(c)          The
representations and warranties set forth in this Section shall
survive the sale of the Receivables by the RPA Seller to the
Purchaser and the sale of the Receivables by the Purchaser to the
Issuer. Upon discovery by the RPA Seller or the Purchaser of a
breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties, the
party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to
the others.

 

Section
2.03         
Representations and Warranties as to the Receivables
.

 

(a)          
Eligibility of Receivables .

 

(i)          The
RPA Seller hereby (A) makes the representations and warranties set
forth on Exhibit A as of the Cutoff Date as to the Receivables (on
which the Purchaser relies in accepting the Receivables) and (B)
consents to the assignment by the Purchaser to the Issuer of the
Purchaser’s rights with respect thereto. Such representations
and warranties speak as of the respective dates set forth therein,
but shall survive the sale, transfer and assignment of the
Receivables to the Issuer under the Sale and Servicing Agreement
and the pledge of such Receivables to the Indenture Trustee under
the Indenture. The RPA Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that
under the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Purchaser will transfer
to the Issuer the Purchaser’s rights under the Receivables
Purchase Agreement, including the representations and warranties of
the RPA Seller as set forth on Exhibit A to this Agreement
(upon which representations and warranties the Issuer relies in
accepting the Receivables and delivering the Securities), together
with all rights of the Purchaser with respect to any breach
thereof, including the right to require the RPA Seller to
repurchase Receivables in accordance with this Agreement. Any
inaccuracy in any of such representations or warranties will be
deemed not to constitute a breach of such representations or
warranties if such inaccuracy does not affect the ability of the
Issuer to receive and retain payment in full on such Receivable on
the terms and conditions and within the timeframe set forth in the
underlying retail installment sales contract.

 

(ii)         The
RPA Seller hereby agrees that the Administrator, on behalf of the
Issuer, shall have the right to enforce any and all rights under
this Agreement assigned to the Issuer under the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, including the right to cause the RPA Seller to
repurchase any Receivable with respect to which it is in breach of
any of its representations and warranties set forth in Exhibit
A , directly against the RPA Seller as though the Issuer were a
party to this Agreement, and the Issuer shall not be obligated to
exercise any such rights indirectly through the
Purchaser.

 

(b)          
Notice of Breach . The representations and warranties set
forth in this Section shall speak as of the execution and delivery
of this Agreement, but shall survive the sale, transfer and
assignment of the Receivables to the Purchaser and any subsequent
assignment or transfer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing
Agreement. The Purchaser, the RPA Seller, the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Delaware Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, as the case
may be, shall inform the other parties promptly, in writing, upon
discovery of any breach of the RPA Seller’s representations
and warranties pursuant to this Section which materially and
adversely affects the interests of the Noteholders in any
Receivable.

 

 6



 

  

(c)          
Repurchase of Receivables . In the event of a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth on Exhibit A which materially
and adversely affects the interests of the Issuer or the
Securityholders and unless the breach shall have been cured by the
last day of the second Collection Period following the Collection
Period in which the discovery of the breach is made or notice is
received, as the case may be (or, at the option of the RPA Seller,
the last day in the first Collection Period following the
Collection Period in which such discovery is made), the RPA Seller
shall repurchase such Receivable. In consideration of the purchase
of any such Receivable, on the related Payment Date, the RPA Seller
shall remit an amount equal to the Warranty Purchase Payment in
respect of such Receivable to the Purchaser and shall be entitled
to receive the Released Warranty Amount. Upon any such repurchase,
each of the Purchaser and the Issuer shall, without further action,
be deemed to transfer, assign and otherwise convey to the RPA
Seller, without recourse, representation or warranty, all the
right, title and interest of either the Purchaser or the Issuer in,
to and under such repurchased Receivable, all monies due or to
become due with respect thereto and all proceeds thereof. The
Purchaser, the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Delaware Trustee or
the Indenture Trustee, as applicable, shall execute such documents
and instruments of transfer or assignment and take such other
actions as shall reasonably be requested by the RPA Seller to
effect the conveyance of such Receivable pursuant to this Section.
The sole remedy of the Purchaser, the Issuer, the Trustees or the
Securityholders with respect to a breach of the RPA Seller’s
representations and warranties pursuant to Section 2.03(a) shall be
to require the RPA Seller to repurchase the related Receivables
pursuant to this Section.

 

Section
2.04         
Covenants of the RPA Seller . The RPA Seller hereby
covenants that:

 

(a)          
Security Interests . Except for the conveyances and grants
of security interests hereunder and contemplated pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Basic Documents, the RPA Seller shall not
sell, pledge, assign or transfer to any other Person, or grant,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any Receivable
or interest therein, and the RPA Seller shall defend the right,
title and interest of the Purchaser in, to and under such
Receivables against all claims of third parties claiming through or
under the RPA Seller; provided , however , that the
RPA Seller’s obligations under this
Section 2.04(a) shall terminate upon the termination of
the Trust pursuant to Section 9.01 of the Trust
Agreement.

 

(b)          
Delivery of Payments . The RPA Seller agrees to deliver in
kind upon receipt to the Servicer under the Sale and Servicing
Agreement (if other than the RPA Seller) all payments received by
the RPA Seller in respect of the Re
