Announcement




Naturally Wholesome Products LLC is voluntarily recalling gallon and pint containers of Half & Half labeled under the brand name Wholesome Country Creamery due to the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase found in samples during routine testing. Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has received no reports of illnesses related to the affected product and is removing the product from the market out of the abundance of caution.All gallon and pint containers involved in this recall have a batch code of 4052917 or 2060517. Distribution of the affected product was limited in scope. No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are affected by this recall.The company initiated this voluntary recall because, in routine testing, samples of the affected product were found to contain Alkaline Phosphatase, an enzyme naturally present in raw milk but not in milk that has been properly pasteurized. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, during a follow-up investigation of the plant, identified 2 batches of Half & Half that were not pasteurized per the requirements of the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.The recall involves 244 units of the affected product which was distributed only in North Carolina. The company is actively notifying customers and is in the process of retrieving the affected product.How to Identify The Recalled ProductThis recall includes only gallon and pint containers of Half & Half that carry the Wholesome Country Creamery brand name. The containers have a small white sticker reading: 4052917 or 2060517.No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are included in this recall.Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product container to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the company at (336) 468-1520.Because the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase in milk suggests the milk may not have been pasteurized sufficiently, it is possible that pathogens present in the raw milk to begin with, including Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, and/or E. coli, have survived and, if ingested, could cause gastrointestinal infection and its potential ensuing complications.

    Impact
  




ReGrained harvests grain from urban craft breweries and upcycles it to create delicious, nutritious, and sustainable food.
We love beer, but brewing it requires a lot of grain. Roughly one pound of grain is used per six pack of beer. Before it eventually becomes the backbone of beer, barley is first grown, then it is malted. After the brewing process, the industry has classically considered the remaining grain “spent.” That’s because the malt’s sugars have been extracted, so its ability to make more beer is literally spent. However, we think you’ll agree that there is still a richness of value in these “spent” grains that is worth saving.
To be sure, brewing beer is an age-old practice, and the “spent” malt is not a newly discovered byproduct. For millennia, breweries and farmers have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship. The farmers come pick up the grain and use it to enrich their soil and feed their animals. However, the boom in craft beer has complicated this historical paradigm.

In 2015, two new breweries opened per day. To our delight, we’re seeing these innovative flavor-forward ventures pop up everywhere. This growth is especially concentrated in cities where dense populations of beer drinkers offer an attractive market for craft beer entrepreneurs.
The classic farmer/brewer partnership is simply less practical in an urban beer production environment. The fuel, tolls, and time costs required for a farmer to complete a supply run into city though mean that urban breweries see less demand for their grain. So, many urban brewers have no better option than to have their grain hauled to compost where it is available, and landfill where it is not. In this inefficiency, we see opportunity.
At ReGrained, we propose that “spent” beer grain instead be harvested and used to close a nutrient loop. In other words, we propose that the leftover grain be recovered from the waste stream and ReGrained.
Why? Because ReGrained grain makes for a phenomenal food ingredient. It is high in protein (by weight, close to as much as almonds) and fiber (more than 3x that of oatmeal), low in sugar (the sugar ends up in the beer), and as most curious homebrewers inevitably discover, it has a great flavor (#yum). From our first product line of bars to those that will come in the form of breads, cookies, cereals, chips, and more—we will develop delicious products built around ReGrained grain.
Our vision is to enable urban ecosystems to do more with less through creativity and innovation. With every decision, we seek to positively impact the community and planet in which we live and run our business. 
As consumers, we get to decide what matters most through what we choose to buy. ReGrained’s mantra is simple: “Brew Good. Bake Good. Do Good.” We invite you to join us in raising the bar together.
Cheers to having your beer...and eating it too,

Jordan and DanCo-Founders

“Eat Beer.”
At last—you can drink your beer and eat it, too.
What started out as a college experiment—baking with the “spent” grain from our homebrew—has grown into a food revolution.
ReGrained Sustainable Supergrain bars are baked with upcycled brewer's malt, harvested from craft breweries. Every 6-pack of beer creates 1 lb of this high protein, high fiber grain—which often goes to waste.
We aspire to put these nutrients back to work—fueling your day, your tastebuds, and (hopefully) your imagination.
We pair our upcycled grain with other simple, wholesome, and thoughtfully sourced ingredients like puffed quinoa, organic oats, and almonds.
Best of all, this ridiculously tasty blend is then wrapped in an adventure-ready, compostable wrapper.
Start out small and sample 3 of each bar: Honey-Cinnamon IPA and Chocolate-Coffee Stout, all wrapped up in a burlap sack. 
Don't just think about it...chew on it.

    Frequently Asked Questions
  



Where can I buy Regrained products?


Here, these stores (and more), Amazon, Imperfect Produce, Good Eggs, Luke's Local, and counting!  If you are a retailer, we're always looking for new partners! If you are interested in wholesale pricing please go here.  If you are an office manager interested in ordering for your team, hit us up too!



Will (or can) your products get me drunk?


ReGrained products do not contain any alcohol. If you are a parent, know that all of our products are safe for children. Plus they are natural, and healthy--built for those by those with an active appetite. Dan's father is a doctor, his mother a dietician. They approve.  But if you're looking to party, don't let us stop you. Bring a bar to pair with your favorite brew...then you can truly have your beer, eat it too!


But is there beer in your products? ?


Upcycled Brewer's Malt is really just barley with less sugar, folks, not beer. High protein, high fiber, delicious grain. 


Are your products organic?

Technically ReGrained products are not currently certified organic. Some of our brewers do use organic malt, but not all. This is not something we can control. That said, we aim to control what we can. Today, most of our ingredients besides the grain are organic. Check out here for more info.  


Is Beer Grain gluten-free?


No. "Spent" beer grain is comprised mostly of barley. This grain has already been through the brewing process, but the remaining grain is NOT gluten-free. In addition to barley, ReGrained beer grain may contain: wheat, oats, and rye.


Are your products fair trade?


We do not currently have the third-party certification for fair trade. This would mostly apply to our chocolate and coffee in the Stout bar. We source chocolate from Guittard, a local bean to bar manufacturer that works directly with small farmers and is indeed Fair Trade certified. We typically buy coffee from local roasters Phillz or De La Paz.


Can you tell us more about your packaging?

ReGrained's commitment to sustainability does not end with our products or sourcing. Sustainable packaging is a non-negotiable value for us. Each bar is wrapped in a backyard compostable wrapper. Read more about ours here.  Our boxes are made from recycled paperboard. All inks are soy or water based. Please recycle them!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
