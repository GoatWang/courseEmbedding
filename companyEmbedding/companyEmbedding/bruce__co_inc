Bruce Products
We are dedicated to upholding the highest level of customer service and installation in the heating and air conditioning industry. Regardless of the season or the outside temperature, our goal is to make your home a more comfortable place to live.
 






Heating
Heat Pumps    
At Bruce we offer a full range of Heat Pump options including models that feature the SilentComfort™ technology from Lennox® which deliver the lowest operating noise level in the industry.  Many of the Heat Pumps we sell come with an industry leading 10 year compressor and parts warranty so you can have peace of mind knowing your equipment is covered. Our Home Comfort Specialists always provide multiple tiered quotes to give you options that will work with your goals and budget.

 
Furnaces
 A properly sized and well installed furnace will not only keep you comfortable in the winter it can also make your home feel better in the summer months. A new high efficiency furnace can reduce your energy bills when paired with an electric heat pump. On milder days the heat pump will provide the warmth and on cold days the furnace will provide it. Give us a call today for a free in home estimate.
Hydronic Heating Systems
Hydronic radiant systems circulate warm or cold water through tubing installed in your walls, floors, and ceiling, to heat or cool your house. This can be a very efficient way to heat or cool your home. At Bruce, Inc. we can install a system that meets your goals. 
Hot Water Tanks
Having a reliable water heater is essential to your home comfort. Bruce Mechanical carries all major brands and will respond quickly if your water heater needs repaired or replaced. 
 
Request a free estimate


Air Conditioning 
Air Conditioners
After being in the sun on a hot day, there’s nothing better than returning to a comfortably cooled home. The newest air conditioners we install offer chlorine-fee R-410A refrigerant, which meets the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s most stringent environmental guidelines. Like the Heat Pumps we install, many of the Lennox® Air Conditioners feature the SilentComfort™ technology which deliver the lowest operating noise level in the industry.

Air Quality
Air Purification
No one wants to breathe in allergens, mold and mildew, or chemical vapors. The PureAir™ system from Lennox helps with not just one of these problems; it helps with all of them. Offering the highest level of in-home air filtration, the PureAir™ system can also help reduce dust, pet dander and pet odors throughout the home. Contact Bruce Inc. today to see if the PurAir™ system can be added to your existing system or if we can incorporate it into your next heating and cooling system.

Ductless Mini-Split Systems
Do you have a room in your house that’s hard to keep warm in the winter or cool in the summer? Maybe you’re planning an addition to your house but the added space doesn’t provide room for ductwork. A ductless mini-split system is the perfect solution for each of these situations. Designed for easy installation, a mini-split system utilizes a wall mounted indoor unit along with a compact outdoor unit to do the work of a traditional heating and cooling system. Give us a call today to see if a mini-split system is right for you.
