BOCA RATON, Fla., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Emergent Capital, Inc. (OTCQB: EMGC) ("Emergent" or the "Issuer") announced today that, in connection with its April 18, 2017 offer to exchange (the "Exchange Offer") any and all of its outstanding $74,220,450 aggregate principal amount of 8.50% Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2019 (the "Old Notes") for $74,220,450 aggregate principal amount of a new series of 5.00% Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2023 (the "New Unsecured Notes") together with a right to subscribe (the "Rights Offering") for 500 shares of Emergent's $0.01 par value common stock at $0.20 per share for each $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered up to an aggregate of 40,000,000 shares, and its previously announced solicitation of consents (the "Consent Solicitation") from the holders of the Old Notes to eliminate substantially all restrictive covenants contained in the Old Notes Indenture and the Old Notes (the "Proposed Amendments"), Emergent has extended the expiration date (the "Expiration Date") of the Exchange Offer, Rights Offering and Consent Solicitation from 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 18, 2017, to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 26, 2017, subject to Emergent's right to further extend the Expiration Date.








As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 18, 2017, according to US Bank, the Information Agent and Exchange Agent for the Exchange Offer, $73,026,450, or 98.39%, of the aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes had been validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Exchange Offer.
General
This announcement shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. The complete terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer are set forth in the offer to exchange dated April 18, 2017, the related consent and letter of transmittal that have been sent to eligible holders of the Old Notes, the amended and restated consent and letter of transmittal, the amendment number 1 to the amended and restated consent and letter of transmittal, the supplement number 1 to the offer to exchange, the supplement number 2 to the offer to exchange, the supplement number 3 to the offer to exchange, the supplement number 4 to the offer to exchange, and the amendment number 7 to the Schedule TO. The Exchange Offer, Rights Offering and Consent Solicitation for the Old Notes is being made only through, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in, the Exchange Offer documents and related materials.
The New Unsecured Notes will not initially be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or in a transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws. 
US Bank is acting as the Information Agent and Exchange Agent for the Exchange Offer. Questions concerning tender procedures and requests for additional copies of the related consents and letters of transmittal may be directed to US Bank at (651) 466-5622 (for brokers and banks) or (800) 934-6802 (for all others). 
Neither Emergent's board of directors nor any other person makes any recommendation as to whether holders of Old Notes should exchange such notes, and no one has been authorized to make such a recommendation. Eligible holders of Old Notes must make their own decisions as to whether to exchange their Old Notes, and if they decide to do so, the principal amount of the Old Notes to exchange. Eligible holders of Old Notes should read carefully the Exchange Offer documents described above and related materials before any decision is made with respect to the Exchange Offer, Rights Offering and Consent Solicitation.

BOCA RATON, Fla., July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Emergent Capital, Inc. (OTCQB: EMGC) ("Emergent" or the "Issuer") announced today that, in connection with its April 18, 2017 offer to exchange (the "Exchange Offer") any and all of its outstanding $74,220,450 aggregate principal amount of 8.50% Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2019 (the "Old Notes") for $74,220,450 aggregate principal amount of a new series of 5.00% Senior Unsecured Convertible Notes due 2023 (the "New Unsecured Notes") together with a right to subscribe (the "Rights Offering") for 500 shares of Emergent's $0.01 par value common stock at $0.20 per share for each $1,000 principal amount of Old Notes tendered up to an aggregate of 40,000,000 shares, and its previously announced solicitation of consents (the "Consent Solicitation") from the holders of the Old Notes to eliminate substantially all restrictive covenants contained in the Old Notes Indenture and the Old Notes (the "Proposed Amendments"), Emergent has extended the expiration date (the "Expiration Date") of the Exchange Offer, Rights Offering and Consent Solicitation from 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 18, 2017, to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 26, 2017, subject to Emergent's right to further extend the Expiration Date.








As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 18, 2017, according to US Bank, the Information Agent and Exchange Agent for the Exchange Offer, $73,026,450, or 98.39%, of the aggregate principal amount of the Old Notes had been validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Exchange Offer.
General
This announcement shall not constitute an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell any securities. The complete terms and conditions of the Exchange Offer are set forth in the offer to exchange dated April 18, 2017, the related consent and letter of transmittal that have been sent to eligible holders of the Old Notes, the amended and restated consent and letter of transmittal, the amendment number 1 to the amended and restated consent and letter of transmittal, the supplement number 1 to the offer to exchange, the supplement number 2 to the offer to exchange, the supplement number 3 to the offer to exchange, the supplement number 4 to the offer to exchange, and the amendment number 7 to the Schedule TO. The Exchange Offer, Rights Offering and Consent Solicitation for the Old Notes is being made only through, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in, the Exchange Offer documents and related materials.
The New Unsecured Notes will not initially be registered under the Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or in a transaction that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws. 
US Bank is acting as the Information Agent and Exchange Agent for the Exchange Offer. Questions concerning tender procedures and requests for additional copies of the related consents and letters of transmittal may be directed to US Bank at (651) 466-5622 (for brokers and banks) or (800) 934-6802 (for all others). 
Neither Emergent's board of directors nor any other person makes any recommendation as to whether holders of Old Notes should exchange such notes, and no one has been authorized to make such a recommendation. Eligible holders of Old Notes must make their own decisions as to whether to exchange their Old Notes, and if they decide to do so, the principal amount of the Old Notes to exchange. Eligible holders of Old Notes should read carefully the Exchange Offer documents described above and related materials before any decision is made with respect to the Exchange Offer, Rights Offering and Consent Solicitation.

A NEW BREED OF FINANCIAL SERVICES 







NON-CORRELATED INVESTMENTS WITH INVESTMENT GRADE COUNTERPARTIES 







EXPERIENCED INVESTMENT TEAM 



 






EMERGENT CAPITAL:
Creating Successful Investment Portfolios
with Life Settlements





Emergent Capital is a global leader in the life settlements industry with decades of experience creating value through the secondary and tertiary markets for life insurance policies.
Life settlements are a unique asset class that can be found in the investment portfolios of well-known investors and successful asset managers. Unlike many other investment classes, life settlements have limited correlation to the stock market or the larger economic market as a whole, and can serve as a hedge against the volatility of more market-dependent investments. Life settlements also represent a compelling and diversified investment opportunity to include longevity risk in a portfolio.
Life insurance is a necessity for millions of Americans, regardless of the current state of the economy. Instead of letting these policies lapse when they are no longer needed, these investments can be sold, usually for a greater return than the surrender value of the policies. Emergent Capital has access to an extensive and proven network of life settlement brokers and third-party providers from whom the company sources attractive and value-added policies.








About Us








Emergent Capital, Inc. (OTCQB®:EMGC) is a specialty finance company that invests in life settlements. The company purchases individual policies and portfolios of life insurance policies. It manages those assets based on comprehensive actuarial and market data.
Led by a management and investment team that is nimble, market-tested and committed to making sound investment decisions, Emergent Capital provides market leadership to the life settlement industry and a timely investment alternative to investors.
Our Business
Emergent Capital was founded in 2006 as Imperial Holdings, LLC and has been publicly traded since 2011. It began as a specialty finance company providing customized liquidity solutions to owners of illiquid financial assets in two distinct markets — Life Finance and Structured Settlements. The company’s management has a long and successful history in helping to build specialty finance companies which have become leaders in the life and structured settlements businesses.
In the spring of 2015, shareholders voted to change the company’s name to Emergent Capital, Inc. The new name — Emergent Capital — better reflects the company’s leading position as an investor in short and long-term life settlement investments.










A Focus on Life Settlements
Emergent Capital is a global investor in life settlements — an alternative asset class that can provide high uncorrelated returns. As one of the largest global investors in life settlements, the company seeks out accretive opportunities to grow its existing portfolio of life settlements by deploying capital in both the secondary and tertiary life settlement markets.
Emergent Capital has access to an extensive network of life settlement brokers and third-party providers from which the company is able to build diversified life insurance portfolios. An Emergent Capital subsidiary is also able to act as a life settlement provider in more than 30 states where it is able to pursue multiple opportunities within the life settlement space. By leveraging its extensive network and years of industry experience, Emergent Capital aims to generate a consistent flow of investment opportunities covering all aspects of the life settlements market place. These range from lending to outright purchases of portfolios, to tertiary trades, as well as individual secondary market purchases.
