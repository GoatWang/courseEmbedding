SEATTLE, June 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 22NW Fund, LP, an investment partnership with more than $200 million under management, announced today that it had transmitted a letter to the Board of InfuSystem Holdings Inc. (NYSEMKT: INFU) to acquire all outstanding shares of INFU for $2.00 per share. 22NW's proposal is an all cash offer, subject to customary due diligence, regulatory approval, and financing, which 22NW Fund believes is readily available. The offer represents a premium of 29% from the close on June 12th, 2017, the day after the offer was transmitted, and would deliver immediate, certain value to INFU's shareholders. 








Aron English, the Manager of 22NW Fund remarked, "Despite the immediate liquidity our offer represents for shareholders, and despite requests from multiple shareholders on INFU's May 22nd conference call to initiate a sale process for the company, INFU's Chairman declined to speak with 22NW Fund about the offer before the Company's upcoming annual meeting, scheduled for June 22nd, 2017.  INFU has proven to be an unsuitable public markets investment with a lifetime return of -37% vs. the Russell 2000 (IWM) of +78%. Year-to-date, INFU is down 39% vs. +4% for the IWM.  The Board owes it to the shareholders to act on our offer now."
22NW Fund believes that the Board's failure to engage immediately after receiving the proposal is a dereliction of the Board's duty to maximize value for shareholders. 22NW Fund calls upon the Board to submit a standard confidentiality agreement to 22NW Fund so that it may begin due diligence immediately. At the same time, the Board should initiate a sale process which may attract other bidders, so that a transaction may be concluded swiftly. 22NW Fund calls upon other shareholders to contact INFU's Board to express their views on these matters.
About 22NW Fund, LP:
Founded in 2015, 22NW Fund is a Seattle-based investment partnership. The firm specializes in small and microcap investments and has a multi-year investment horizon.

London-based TH Real Estate unveiled its U.S. Cities Fund series, a re-launch of the $2 billion TIAA-CREF Core Property Fund LP that plans to invest in retail, office, industrial and multifamily properties in major urban markets in the US. As the U.S. Cities Fund, the series will have separate open-end funds for retail, office, industrial and multifamily properties in top urban markets in the U.S. As of year-end 2014, TIAA-CREF Core Property Fund was 31% invested in multifamily, 30% in offices, 34% in retail and 15% in industrial. About 70% of its investments were in the coastal markets. The fund had posted 10.8% 5-year return. The U.S. Cities Fund launch follows the March debut of the European Cities fund and is the first offering from the company’s recently unified real estate business. It also claims the fund makes TH Real Estate the only investment manager to sponsor open-ended, core funds in each of the four main property sectors. Concurrent with the launch of the U.S. Cities Fund series, TIAA Global Asset Management’s U.S. real estate operations are being integrated with TH Real Estate’s existing third-party global investment platform. Mike Sales, head of Europe and Asia at TH Real Estate and Chris McGibbon, head of TH Real Estate Americas will lead co-lead the unified business. TIAA-CREF and Henderson Global Investors merged their real estate investment operations two years ago as TIAA Henderson Real Estate, which became TH Real Estate. As the third-largest real estate manager in the world, TH Real Estate manages $97 billion in assets under management and a suite of nearly 80 funds. TH Real Estate is part of the global real assets unit within TIAA Global Asset Management and will remain so. The U.S. Cities Funds will reside on the TH Real Estate platform, along with all other real estate funds currently managed by TIAA Global Asset Management, including the U.S. Super Regional Mall Fund, which launched last month.  TIAA Global Asset Management successfully raised $1.25 billion enable the fund to target a portfolio of approximately $2.5 billion.

U.S. Cities Fund series designed to provide investors with customized sector allocations joins European Cities Fund to focus on commercial real estate investing in long-term growth marketsSeptember 21, 2016 – TH Real Estate has unveiled the U.S. Cities Fund series, a re-launch of the TIAA-CREF Core Property Fund LP that focuses on investments in retail, office, industrial and multifamily properties in top urban markets of the United States. The launch, which follows the March debut of the European Cities fund, is the first offering from the company’s recently unified real estate business and makes TH Real Estate the only investment manager to sponsor open-ended, core funds in each of the four main property sectors.The U.S. Cities Funds provide investors with the option to invest in one single overarching master fund, offering exposure to all four sectors in one vehicle, or select exposure via four sector funds, which allow for customized sector allocation and the opportunity for enhanced diversification, liquidity and returns. The series of open-ended funds offer exposure to ‘core’ real estate properties that are well-located, well-leased and possess attractive current cash flows and strong tenant bases in growing urban markets. The introduction follows the launch earlier this year of TH Real Estate’s European Cities Fund, which seeks to provide investors with diversified and defensive income return and optimize long-term total return by investing only in ‘future-proof cities’ across Europe.“We believe that highly-focused, sector-specific strategies and local execution are the keys to consistent outperformance in real estate investing,” said Randy Giraldo, managing director and portfolio manager for the U.S. Cities Funds. “Investors are increasingly seeking access to sector-specific core funds and now TH Real Estate offers investors the opportunity, with a single manager, to customize their exposure to the four main property sectors.”The global city-based real estate strategy filters and scores cities through a proprietary system developed by TH Real Estate’s research team. It defines which cities are believed to be structurally positioned to provide the greatest and most consistent total return. This top down approach is augmented with best in class local execution. Across the globe, TH Real Estate has investment professionals imbedded in its target markets to efficiently source and manage transactions across a variety of strategies.Concurrent with the launch of the U.S. Cities Fund series, TIAA Global Asset Management’s U.S. real estate operations are being integrated with TH Real Estate’s existing third-party global investment platform. As the third-largest real estate manager in the worldi, TH Real Estate manages $97bn in AUM and a suite of nearly 80 funds and mandates spanning both debt and equity across diverse geographies, sectors, investment styles and vehicle types, providing clients with access to every aspect of real estate investing. TH Real Estate is part of the global real assets unit within TIAA Global Asset Management and will remain so. The U.S. Cities Funds will reside on the TH Real Estate platform, along with all other real estate funds currently managed by TIAA Global Asset Management, including the U.S. Super Regional Mall Fund.“We’ve been offering cross-border investment solutions for years, but having a unified investment approach will allow us to deliver a consistent menu of global real state solutions across geographies, styles and sectors,” said Chris McGibbon, Head of TH Real Estate Americas said. “Integrating capabilities across all three regions to form a fully unified and commercialized global real estate platform ensures that we are squarely focused on delivering innovative products supported by local knowledge, expert execution and a long-term view that goes beyond market cycles.”The unification of TIAA Global Asset Management’s U.S. real estate operations with TH Real Estate reflects the firm’s focus on third-party real estate investment management. Mike Sales, Head of Europe and Asia, TH Real Estate and Chris McGibbon co-lead the unified business. TH Real Estate was established in 2014 when TIAA (then TIAA-CREF) and Henderson Global Investors formed a joint venture between their real estate operations. About TH Real EstateTH Real Estate, an operating division of TIAA Global Asset Management, is one of the largest real estate investment managers in the world with $97 billion in AUM.
