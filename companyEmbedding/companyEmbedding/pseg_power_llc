About this Case Study

Challenge

		When PSE&G SMD outgrew its existing office, the company set its sights on a new space that would be consistent with its commitment to a greener future. They turned to ModSpace. 

        

Solution

		ModSpace helped PSE&G realize its vision with a new LEED-certifiable facility that was ready for occupancy in less than 90 days. Working in lock step with representatives of PSE&G, ModSpace built the new office from four modules that can be easily relocated and reused, which will reduce future building costs and construction waste. 


Exterior and interior aesthetics were designed and built to match the look and feel of PSE&G’s neighbouring building just 20 feet away. 


The LEED-certifiable building incorporates systems that reduce the building’s water consumption and increase energy performance. Indoor Environmental Quality was a significant part of obtaining LEED credits. The IAQ management plan involved the use of low emitting materials and controllability of lighting and thermal comfort systems. Careful construction, waste management, the use of recycled content, and recyclability were all keys to keeping the project green. 


LEED certification for this building is currently in process. PSE&G employees have moved in and are enjoying their new sustainable office building.

Answer 






                        I tried to login with my Login ID and Password, but I get the error message "Login
                        Failed". What do I do?



                        The password is case sensitive. Please be sure to enter the password exactly the
                        way it is written in your confirmation email or the way you have entered it after
                        changing the initial computer-generated password.

                        If you continue to have difficulty, please copy and paste the user id and password
                        directly from the confirmation email.
                    





                        What does SBA CCR mean?

                        U.S. Federal Government. The CCR collects, validates, stores and disseminates data
                        in support of agency acquisition missions.

                        What is an NAICS Code?
                    



                        The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is used to categorize
                        what type of service/product a vendor provides.
                    





                        None of these NAICS codes apply to my company. Which one am I supposed to pick?
                    



                        Pick a best match for NAICS. There will be an opportunity in the registration form
                        to further define the service/product your company can provide to PSEG.
                    





                        I clicked the number (NAICS Code), and nothing happened. What's wrong?
                    



                        If you didn't click on a 6-digit code, you might have just expanded the list for
                        what you did click. If you scroll down, you should see this list.
                    

                        If you did click a 6-digit code, it should have been entered into the box on the
                        main form.
                    





                        Why can't I type in the box (NAICS Code(s))?
                    



                        Click the "Click here to select" link to get a pop-up window. You can click on the
                        links to branch down to the 6-digit number for the NAICS Code.
                    





                        I'm filling out the registration form, and it's telling me my email address or tax
                        ID is already in use.
                    



                        There are two possibilities.
                    

                        Someone at your company has already registered with PSEG, or that your company is
                        already in PSEG's database. In this case, go to the Vendor Login page and click
                        the "Forgotten Your Password?" link. Enter the email address in the box in the pop-up
                        window and click submit. The password will be sent to the email address.
                    

                        You may have just registered, and you're trying to submit the registration form
                        again. Please go to the Vendor Login page and click the "Forgotten Your Password?"
                        link. Enter the email address in the box in the pop-up window and click submit.
                        The password will be sent to the email address.
                    

                        If you still have problems, please contact tech. support at 1-800-233-1121.
                    





                        I used the "Forgotten Your Password?" link but I did not receive an email with the
                        information
                    



                        If your company information is already in the PSEG system, it is very possible that
                        we may have contact information from someone else on file. In this case they will
                        receive the email.
                    





                        The person who set up the original profile is no longer with the company or I don’t
                        know who set up the profile originally, what should I do?
                    



                        Please contact technical support at 1-800-233-1121 to retrieve the information or
                        to have new contact information updated in the system. The new person on file will
                        then receive the confirmation of the new password.
