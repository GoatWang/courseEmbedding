For example, we discovered one unsuspecting blogger who drove more website traffic than content featured in Vogue and Vanity Fair combined. Without the help of Trendkite, we wouldn't have been able to measure the impact that this food blogger had in driving sales for us.  I love how interactive and customizable this tool is. Trendkite has one of the best customer care team that's super quick to respond in any given situation.   What do you dislike?Sometimes, I can get lost in the amount of data we get from Trendkite. Because there are so many features, it's at times difficult to hone into what exactly we're looking to accomplish using the platform. However, the Customer care team has always been supportive of our needs. We've never had issues to a point where it was frustrating or slightly inefficient. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Trendkite allows us to be more proactive in measuring our coverage which is crucial to the company's growth strategy. Instead of relying heavily on traditional press coverage, the team is discovering that there are various metrics to consider when measuring the value of a publication. Trendkite is an effective tool that allows us to monitor, develop, and maintain our relationships internally.

Customization is key for my agency and TrendKite does a great job of working with us to make sure we're getting exactly what we need.What do you dislike?The only thing I dislike is that I'm not an expert in writing advanced searches so I don't feel like I can always go in and do the work myself. However, the TrendKite customer support team has always gotten the work done for me in an accurate and timely manner. If you're looking for a tool that can run in the background and be maintained by a solid support team, this is a great tool for you!Recommendations to others considering the productConsider how you work best. Do you like to get your hands dirty and dig into a platform? If you have the time to learn or are already familiar with advanced search terms, TrendKite will be a lot of fun for you. On the other hand, if you're looking for a tool that you can set up with the support team and let run in the background, this is also a great reason to go with TrendKite. Their customer support team is extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Whether it's through teaching sessions / demos of new products in person or basic support via the platform's chat, TrendKite will do everything in their power to get you the results you need.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Having the ability to quickly pull a variety of reports is extremely important to my agency. Having the ability to quickly create a variety of dashboards has been a big help for a wide variety of client and coverage needs.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as TrendKiteReport a ConcernAre you a current user of TrendKite?YesNoWhat PR Analytics solution do you use?CisionMeltwaterBusiness WireCoveragebook.comGorkanaAgility PR SolutionsMarketwiredBurrellesLuce WorkFlowMyMediaInfoPRglooAgility Media Monitoring & AnalyticsProwlyI don't use PR Analytics softwareThanks for letting us know!Jasmine C.Review SourceJasmine C.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceFinally, PR and Metrics!Updated On January 27, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?I love that Trendkite gives me the ability to show ROI on PR initiatives. I also love that I can drill down on where my competitors are gaining traction. I can monitor share of voice in comparison to competitors, I can recognize trends in coverage patterns and relate it to a specific push. I also love that when I have a question, it gets answered almost immediately right in the app. It also lets me make really nice, sleek reports that I send monthly to the management team. What do you dislike?The only thing I dislike so far is that sometimes the program picks up false positives in coverage which can make it a bit tricky to get the metrics perfect. However they're constantly improving. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?I've never been able to quantify the impact of PR prior to Trendkite, This has been a total game changer for me.

Many times coverage that I think is important isn't automatically picked up by TrendKite and I have to enter it manually. It makes me wonder what else I'm missing.Recommendations to others considering the productIf you use Google analytics on your company website TrendKite is your only option. They are ahead of the game and constantly working to improve their products. If customer service is important to you, if you like quick helpful answers, TrendKite is for you. I've never worked with any media product that matched their level of service. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?The reason we went with TrendKite was to monitor what was happening in the media when we weren't watching. TrendKite has been a big help addressing this issue. We have also made the move to utilizing the TrendKite reporting function, which has been a huge timesaver over the weekly manual coverage reports we used do.

The interface is great, love how easy it is to download an interactive dashboard and share it with a client so I they can see their SOV compared to others, click through to the most relevant links, etc. What do you dislike?Not very reliable for extreme accuracy or catching all a client's coverage. Often duplicate pick-ups of a single piece, and difficult to edit boolean terms so that irrelevant articles are not included. This can throw off the accuracy of a share of voice report, and in order to fix it it needs a heavy manual touch. I'd like to feel more confident in spinning up a report and sharing it with a client without having to spend a solid amount of time removing irrelevant content, duplicates, etc. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Helps us show growth in a client's share of voice over time compared to their competitors. We're able to point to growth as a direct result of successful PR campaigns.

Updated On March 28, 2016Validated ReviewWhat do you like best?The customer service. Our account rep is outstanding! She's always gets back to us right away, is very thorough and always willing to go the extra mile which is something I've never experienced before dealing with media monitoring vendors for the past 20 years. What do you dislike?I love that our account rep can pull reports for us but it would also be good for us to have the ability to pull/combine months on our own. Recommendations to others considering the productIt's a great tool and it makes monitoring/reporting much easier. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?TrendKite helps us proof our worth to our board of directors and our members by visually showing all the media hits we get. The social media amplification feature on TrendKite that lets you see which media hits were shared most on social media is something we have never been able to do before and it allows us to extend the shelf life and value of our media hits.
