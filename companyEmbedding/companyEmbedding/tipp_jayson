Top Players in Franchise Development: Jayson Tipp


As the Chief Development Officer and Senior Vice President of Technology, Jayson Tipp has watched Papa Murphy’s grow to 1,500 locations. 




BY: ALISON HOESLI

                                                            1851 Contributor                                                                                                                    

















Jayson Tipp joined Papa Murphy’s in 2012 as the Senior Vice President of Technology after transitioning between roles in consumer strategy, marketing and development at Starbucks, Potbelly and, most recently, Redbox. In 2015, Tipp was promoted to Chief Development Officer and Senior Vice President of Technology at Papa Murphy’s. The experienced industry leader is now responsible for franchise sales, real estate and construction with a focus on senior leadership for key strategic initiatives related to long-term growth strategies in technology. 1851 Franchise recently spoke with Tipp to learn more about what he has in store for Papa Murphy’s in the years to come.  What makes Papa Murphy’s franchise development process tick? I think the reason our development is successful is the same reason we’ve been so successful as a brand. Papa Murphy’s has a differentiated concept and product. We provide an uncooked product with a great value proposition and a low investment opportunity. On top of that, we have unparalleled customer loyalty. Our most common lead generator is our storefront. Many of our franchise candidates say they were once passionate customers before becoming franchise owners, which has not only helped us develop in existing markets, but additionally break into new territories.    What have been some of Papa Murphy’s major milestones? In my time at Papa Murphy’s, our major milestone was when we surpassed 1,500 stores in 2015. We now have the attainable goal of opening the largest number of stores we have ever opened in one year. It’s an exciting time to be a part of a growing brand. What are you most proud of? One of the reasons I like the development role in a franchise organization is that you become the problem solver. I’ve been an outlet to help franchisees open stores faster, smooth out the development process, negotiate a lease and renew store costs. It’s not the frequent problems franchisees deal with day-to-day on the ground floor but it’s meaningful and a real benefit to them. I’m proud that I’m able to help make that process easier. What specific steps do your most successful franchisees take in order to build and grow their respective businesses?  Franchisees need to understand the business and the investment that they’re making. They need to be thoughtful in planning their growth strategies and know the risks involved with expansion. Those that take the risks too lightly tend to underestimate what it might take to build a thriving business through the ups and downs. What are your goals for your brand in the next few years and how do you plan to grow the brand? We have some published growth goals in terms of our new store openings. We’d like to triple the size of our business long term in the U.S. We’ d also like to make openings an easier, more turnkey process for franchisees while ensuring success in the long-term moving forward.
