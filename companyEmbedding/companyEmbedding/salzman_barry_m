BBB Reason for Ratings

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

Too often, they are confused by the application process, or worse yet, are denied benefits. Barry Salzman has made a career out of fighting for those who need help the most. Social Security Disability Benefits Applying for SSD benefits is not an easy task and more than half of first time applicants are denied benefits. Fortunately, Mr. Salzman has an impressive track record of handling cases that have been denied, and often denied more than once, and ultimately prevailing. As a St. Petersburg Social Security disability lawyer, Mr. Salzman knows how to speak the language of Social Security; it is not enough to merely recite the medical condition of a claimant, it is essential to explain how that medical condition impacts the claimant's life.   Serving You in A Variety of Practice Areas   Social Security Disability     Veterans Disability    Long-Term Disability    Workers Compensation    Personal Injury      Social Security is but one program that is designed to provide benefits for those who can no longer work. In addition to his practice as a St. Petersburg Social Security disability attorney, Mr. Salzman has extensive experience in:  Disability Insurance; many companies offer disability plans, either as a benefit to employees or as an optional program. Unlike Social Security that only recognizes permanent disability, most disability insurance plans cover both short term and long term disability.   Veteran's Disability; if you have s service related disability concerning past disability benefits, Mr. Salzman may be able to assist you.   Workers' Compensation; injuries on-the-job while working while working for Florida employers.    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.   Experienced Attorney, You Can Trust For over 40 years Mr. Salzman has zealously represented his clients. Admitted to practice before all Florida state courts, all Federal courts in Florida and the U.S. Supreme Court, his AV rating from Martindale-Hubbell truly sets Mr. Salzman apart as an elite lawyer.                       Navigating the bureaucracy of any disability program is complex and frustrating and often ends in denial. Don't go it alone. Have a dedicated, experienced advocate on your team. Call Barry Salzman, Attorney at Law at 727-321-4993.
