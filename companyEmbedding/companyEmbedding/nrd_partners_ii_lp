How Aziz Hashim Is Changing The Franchising Landscape



















We Are Re-defining Private Equity...
...in franchise and chain business investing. We believe in the total alignment of interests among our key stakeholders – the management team of our Portfolio Companies, our Fund Investors (predominantly multi-unit/multi-brand franchisees), and our Fund’s operationally-experienced Partners. Through our unique access to multi-unit franchisees and wider networks, NRD is the next evolution of the franchise private equity space.













We Are Financial And Strategic Partners
Because we are operators and we’ve walked in Founder/Owner/Entrepreneur/Executive shoes, we know money isn’t the answer to all business goals. Oftentimes, when businesses are at critical junctures in their life cycles, expertise, resources, an outside perspective and seasoned guidance are just as crucial as cash to building a dynamic and sustainable business. When a business merits not only capital, but also operational and strategic support, NRD Capital shines as the partner who provides both.















We Are Franchisee-centric
While we invest in franchisors, we are franchisee-centric. We are focused on the unit-level profitability of every brand we evaluate, especially for those we invest in. Our mission is to invest in brands that offer superior products/services and compelling unit-level economics in order to help them strategically grow through the power of franchising. We believe that when franchisees and franchisors work together as partners, all parties win.

















The NRD Difference





OUR FUND







OUR MANAGEMENT







OUR MOTIVATION











OUR FUND
NRD Capital occupies a unique niche among franchise equity investors. Our fund invests with small to medium-sized franchisors, infuses capital and applies our operating expertise to grow those brands. We look at franchise companies not just as financial investments, but as living entities in which concept founders/management and franchisees have invested substantial amounts of time and resources. Our goal is to use our operational and financial experience to position high quality brands for accelerated but responsible growth.


OUR MANAGEMENT
Our team has extensive franchise experience spanning single store operations to public companies. At our core, we are operators. Collectively, our team has been involved with 20 brands including top global companies like Popeyes, Burger King, Subway and Domino's. We’ve also worked with major regional brands such as Moe's Southwest Grill, Pet Valu, Super Wash and local startups like Urban Grounds and Tutor Force. Our experience encompasses every area of the franchise business model from sales, financing and real estate development to operations, marketing, HR  technology and successful exit strategies.


OUR MOTIVATION
Our fund was born when our Founder, Aziz Hashim, set out to fulfill two goals: 1) to put 1,000 entrepreneurs into business and 2) to provide our franchisee-investors with an opportunity to participate in business as franchisors. The core pillar of NRD's strategy is to invest in brands where franchisee success is the central value.

NRD Capital Management (“NRD”), the first franchisee-sponsored and managed equity investment fund, recently announced its latest investment —the purchase of a majority position in Fuzzy’s Taco Shop®, a 90-unit Fort Worth, Texas-based brand. Expanding from its recent acquisition of Frisch’s® Big Boy® Restaurants, NRD is focused on investing in - and accelerating the growth of - brands that offer superior products and compelling unit economics.
“NRD Capital is doing what it set out to do from beginning,” said Aziz Hashim, NRD Capital Founder and Managing Partner. “We are finding brands with compelling unit economics and partnering with their existing management teams to maximize the impact that the brand can have through franchising. Our approach to private equity is unlike anything in the space, and it’s proving to be extremely fruitful."
NRD represents the next generation of private equity with a total alignment of interests among the fund’s operations-minded Partners, the multi-unit franchisees who constitute the majority of Fund Investors, and the management teams of its portfolio companies. Hashim went on to say that through the fund’s unique access to its multi-unit franchisee investor base and wider networks, NRD is evolving the franchise private equity space.
“We’re thrilled to be partnering with NRD Capital,” said Chuck Bush, Fuzzy’s Taco Shop President. “We have seen great success with our brand, primarily growing throughout the Southern and Midwestern U.S. We knew that to grow our business dramatically, we needed a partner who knows franchising, has access to qualified developers and is willing to partner with our existing team to enhance the brand and maximize growth.”
Fuzzy’s Taco Shop is a fast-casual Baja-style Mexican food concept that has built its reputation on an unwavering promise to promptly and efficiently provide guests with generous helpings of uniquely flavorful foods at a fair price in a fun atmosphere.
“The unit economics and growth potential of Fuzzy’s Taco Shop makes it the perfect fit for us,” said NRD Partner Harrison Price. “We have the tools to make Fuzzy’s a powerhouse in the fast casual segment by working with management to enrich this fun, exciting brand and by focusing on bringing additional operators in to accelerate new development.”
Mel Knight, Vice President, Fuzzy’s Taco Shop, adds, “We could not be more excited to partner with NRD for not only the future of our brand development, but also for our current franchisees who have been instrumental in our success to date.”

Behold the Epic Burrito, a hefty tortilla stuffed with beans cooked from scratch for three hours each day and cheddar cheese shredded in-house from a 40-pound block and displayed front and center at every Del Taco—for about five bucks.
It’s the embodiment of Del Taco’s effort to thread the needle between quick-service and fast-casual—to beat Taco Bell on price and yet rival Chipotle on food quality (and let’s stipulate, this is setting aside Chipotle’s recent food safety stumbles.)
That strategy, to become “QSR-Plus” as analysts and Del Taco’s CEO Paul Murphy himself have started to say, was developed after intense research starting in 2011, when Murphy and his team realized the 50-year-old brand just wasn’t cutting it with millennials. They had full kitchens in every restaurant and cooked food the old-fashioned way, but they weren’t telling customers about it so they got zero credit.
So they researched McDonald’s and Chick-fil-A and Jack in the Box, interviewing former executives and poring over public documents to see what those brands did to reinvent.
“The companies we thought were successful didn’t do one thing,” Murphy says. “They really signaled change in everything that touches the customer.” The eventual strategy, called “combined solutions,” was good enough to convince their long-suffering owners, led by private equity firm Goldman Sachs, to recapitalize the brand in 2013 (that means put in more money); they would ultimately hold Del Taco for 10 long years, and Murphy gives them credit. “They were willing to give us the time and money to execute the strategy,” he says.
It was also enough to attract the attention of Larry Levy, the Chicago restaurant tycoon who spent several months visiting Del Taco restaurants and putting together investors, ultimately winning the 550-unit Del Taco last June via a SPAC. That stands for special purchase acquisition company, which is a little-used vehicle these days. “You see the SPAC’s are targeting businesses that are built out, not purely speculative” like in the past, Murphy says. “It was a perfect match.”
The deal came in two steps. First, the Levy family and investors bought $120 million of Del Taco common stock, 46 percent of the company, and increased senior debt by $35.1 million under the existing credit agreement with GE Capital. Those proceeds were used to retire $111 million in senior debt. In step two, a Levy Acquisition subsidiary merged into Del Taco, taking the company public for a $500 million valuation.

ATLANTA – NRD Capital Management (“NRD”), via its initial investment fund NRD Capital Partners I, L.P., announced its first acquisition with the purchase of Frisch’s Restaurants, a 121-unit Cincinnati-based brand, for approximately $175 million. NRD Capital Partners is the first franchisee-sponsored and managed investment fund focused on investing in - and accelerating the growth of – brands that offer superior products and compelling unit economics.
"This is the right transaction for the company," said retiring Frisch’s CEO Craig Maier. "Frisch’s has been a family operated business since my grandfather opened our first drive-in in 1939. On behalf of my entire family, I’d like to thank our loyal customers for allowing us to serve them ever since."
With its first acquisition complete, NRD’s Founder and Managing Partner Aziz Hashim said his team’s focus is now turning toward growth of Frisch’s by positioning the brand for additional operators to join and accelerate new development.
"During the last year, our team thoroughly analyzed many potential acquisitions, looking for a successful brand that had tremendous potential and which could benefit from our expertise,” Hashim said. “We settled on Frisch’s, because we believe it is perfectly positioned for growth and because its business model is friendly to multi-unit franchisee expansion."
"Our team is very excited about the Frisch’s acquisition. We already have a second acquisition in process now, and I have been very pleased with the reception NRD has had in the M&A market," Hashim said.





When Isaac Singer created a business model to speed up the production and distribution of his patented, widely-used sewing machines in the early 1850s, the world was first introduced to the newfound concept of franchising. By the late 1930s, with the advent of fast food restaurants, franchising began to pick up steam, and ever since, the number of franchised businesses steadily grew. Today, there are more than 800,000 franchise opportunities worldwide in the over $2 trillion industry.
Yet, after all these decades, it was only two years ago that the modern franchise world welcomed its first franchisee-sponsored and managed equity fund, NRD Capital. Boasting a seasoned team with more than 50 years of franchise experience—from single store operations to public company management—the company focuses on acquiring, positioning and growing small to medium-sized brands for accelerated success. In its first year, NRD Capital had already acquired two major franchises—first Frisch’s Restaurants Inc., and, most recently, Fuzzy’s Taco Shop.
Chances are, those familiar with the franchising world will recognize this franchisee fund’s Founder and Managing Partner—Aziz Hashim. And there is also a good chance that those people will be quick to say that thanks to Hashim, multi-brand and multi-unit franchise development as we know it is being rewritten.
“Aziz Hashim is the embodiment of a shifting balance of power over the last few years that puts many multi-unit operators on equal footing with, and in many cases several rungs above, the franchisor whose stores they buy and whose rules they follow,” wrote Beth Ewen, editor of the Franchise Times. “Hashim is a man in franchising to be reckoned with.”
For Hashim, it all started with the founding of NRD Holdings in 1996, when he opened his first KFC restaurant in Atlanta. He soon opened a Subway next door. Fast forward three years, and he had built up a 10-unit empire, which he quickly grew to more than 60 units. But it was never just about building volume—diversification was also important to Hashim, and he eventually invested in various concepts including Checkers & Rally’s, Popeye’s, Domino's, and more.

PRESS RELEASE
ATLANTA, GA – July 12, 2017 – NRD Capital Management, LLC (“NRD”), an Atlanta-based private equity firm that specializes in franchised and multi-location business investments, today announced it has closed NRD Partners II L.P. (“NRDP II”) with total investor limited partner commitments of $104.5 million secured over the past four months, exceeding the fund’s target of $100 million.
NRD focuses on companies specializing in franchised and multi-location business models. With NRDP II, the firm will continue its strategy of investing in brands that offer superior products/services and compelling unit economics, and maximizing their potential through the franchise business model. As NRD looks to invest NRDP II, it will continue to invest in domestic and international restaurant concepts, as well as new and emerging verticals such as healthcare franchising, in order to take advantage of important future trends.
“We are extremely pleased at how quickly we were able to raise this fund as it is a testament to the confidence our limited partners have in our unique investment philosophy. We greatly appreciate the continued support from our Fund I investors – 95 percent of whom have also invested in Fund II, many with significantly higher commitments,” said Aziz Hashim, Managing Partner of NRD. “We are also delighted to welcome a number of new investors to Fund II. In fact, interest has been so great that the fund is oversubscribed and has a waiting list of additional interested investors.” 





NRD is currently investing out of NRD Partners I L.P., a $46 million fund raised in 2014. Overall, NRD has raised over $150 million of equity capital commitments since its inception in 2014.
Hashim continued: “With our operating expertise, wide network of franchisees and partnership approach to interacting with our portfolio companies, we have the unique ability to enable accelerated, but responsible, growth for brands. We look forward to making collaborative equity investments to enhance our portfolio and create opportunities for entrepreneurs through franchising.”
NRD has thus far acquired two multi-location franchise brands, Frisch’s Big Boy and Fuzzy’s Taco Shop, which have generated $450 million in annual system revenues from 220 locations in 12 states. Both brands are currently in NRD’s portfolio. For more information please visit www.nrdcapital.com.

      business models. With NRDP II, the firm will continue its strategy of 
      investing in brands that offer superior products/services and compelling 
      unit economics, and maximizing their potential through the franchise 
      business model. As NRD looks to invest NRDP II, it will continue to 
      invest in domestic and international restaurant concepts, as well as new 
      and emerging verticals such as healthcare franchising, in order to take 
      advantage of important future trends.
    

      “We are extremely pleased at how quickly we were able to raise this fund 
      as it is a testament to the confidence our limited partners have in our 
      unique investment philosophy. We greatly appreciate the continued 
      support from our Fund I investors – 91 percent of whom have also 
      invested in Fund II, many with significantly higher commitments,” said 
      Aziz Hashim, Managing Partner of NRD. “We are also delighted to welcome 
      a number of new investors to Fund II. In fact, interest has been so 
      great that the fund is oversubscribed and has a waiting list of 
      additional interested investors.”
    

      Hashim continued: “With our operating expertise, wide network of 
      franchisees and partnership approach to interacting with our portfolio 
      companies, we have the unique ability to enable accelerated, but 
      responsible, growth for brands. We look forward to making collaborative 
      equity investments to enhance our portfolio and create opportunities for 
      entrepreneurs through franchising.”
    

      NRD has thus far acquired two multi-location franchise brands, Frisch’s 
      Big Boy and Fuzzy’s 
      Taco Shop, which have generated $450 million in annual system 
      revenues from 220 locations in 12 states. Both brands are currently in 
      NRD’s portfolio. For more information please visit www.nrdcapital.com.
