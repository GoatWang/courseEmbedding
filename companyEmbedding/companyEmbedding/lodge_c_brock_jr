As a collgeague with Everett at the Midwest Electric Railway, we became good friends. Then I discovered he was a Marine, as was I. Well I heard of his escapades then we shared war stories. He did not have any medals so I worked at getting those for him. I made his shadow boxes so everyone could see how much of a hero he was. Semper Fidelis Corporal Brock. R.I.P.

Marie and Family,
We were saddened to learn of Everett's passing.  We had the pleasure of accompanying him to Washington, D.C. on his HonorAir trip for WWII veterans, and it was a wonderful experience for us to get to know this kind and dignified gentleman.  We know this is a difficult time of grief, but we hope you can find solace in remembering what a generous and gracious life he lived.  We keep Everett and all of you in our prayers.
Dennis and Kathy Hayward
