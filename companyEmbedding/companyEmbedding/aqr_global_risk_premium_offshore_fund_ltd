Global Risk Premium Trust



Fact Sheet












Overview








Investment Objective
                                The AQR Global Risk Premium Trust (“the Fund”) is a globally diversified and risk balanced portfolio, containing exposure to asset classes such as equities, government bonds, commodities and inflation-linked securities. A distinguishing feature of AQR’s investment approach is to manage the Fund’s exposure to asset classes and individual markets by their contribution to portfolio risk, rather than by allocating capital to each asset class (as is done in the more traditional approach to portfolio construction). Through the use of modest levels of leverage obtained through the use of derivative contracts and a highly disciplined risk management framework, the Fund seeks to achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return, while maintaining a stable risk profile through the market cycle.* The universe of investments for the Fund may change under varying conditions and as the instruments evolve over time.
                                
Investment Approach
                                The Fund invests in a globally diversified portfolio of over 60 markets, across the following assets**:


Equity Risk

Large-Cap Developed Equity
Emerging Market Equity
U.S. Mid-Cap Equity
U.S. Small-Cap Equity



Nominal Interest Rate Risk

Developed Market Bonds



Inflation Risk

Global Inflation-Protected Securities
Commodities

 
* There are investment risks to consider when using leverage and derivatives.
** Assets are subject to change at any time.

                    Investment Strategies
                    



Overview


Investment Strategies


Investment Vehicles









All of our investment strategies reflect our basic investment philosophy. That is, we identify
potential sources of return through our applied research efforts, which combine economic
theory and intuition, and are informed by decades of data across geographies and asset groups.


Alternative Investment Strategies

We have identified alternative investing strategies that have the potential to increase an overall portfolio’s expected return, decrease its risk and make it more resilient to different economic environments. With diligent care, we believe these alternative strategies can be an effective complement to traditional asset classes. 
Absolute Return



Event Driven seeks to capture mispricing between highly related securities, as when a company’s shares trade on different exchanges at different prices, or a convertible bond trades for less than the value of its components.


Fixed Income seeks to capture relative value views across issuers, industries, countries and ratings.


Macro investing seeks to benefit from mispricings and dislocations in stock, bond, currency and commodity markets by going long assets that the data suggest are undervalued and short those that are overvalued.


Managed Futures focuses on capturing trends in global stock, bond, currency and commodity markets.


Multi-Strategy offers a diversified approach to alternatives investing, seeking to provide broad exposure to several different strategies — such as arbitrage, stock selection and macro — at the same time.

Real Return investing involves actively managing a diversified portfolio of liquid, inflation-sensitive assets, designed with the objective to benefit from increases in inflation.


Stock Selection seeks to profit from market inefficiencies in individual stocks, as when a stock’s price appears higher or lower than the company’s intrinsic value indicates it should be.

Style Premia seeks to harvest the return premia from value, momentum, carry and defensive themes across asset classes and geographies.



Total Return



Long/Short Equity involves buying stocks we expect to do well and short selling those we expect to do poorly, seeking to provide investors equity-like returns with less volatility.


Risk Parity is a strategy that diversifies across global, liquid asset classes by risk, seeking to build a portfolio that is not reliant on any single asset class for long-term performance.




Traditional Investment Strategies

Our traditional strategies seek to take full advantage of sources of returns that have generated long-term outperformance in the past, and, based on our rigorous evaluation, are expected to continue to do so in the future.
Equities


Defensive Equity seeks to build a lower-risk portfolio by overweighting stocks that exhibit higher quality and are less volatile relative to an index and underweighting lower quality, more-volatile stocks.
Diversified Equities strategies employ alpha signals from our absolute return strategies and seek to beat equity benchmarks. International funds also consider the performance of each country and currency.
Momentum strategies seek to profit from the tendency of outperforming stocks to continue to outperform, a phenomenon that has been studied extensively and shown to be pervasive across markets and asset classes.
Multistyle strategies seek to outperform a benchmark, such as the Russell 1000, by focusing on stocks that are deemed attractive on the basis of factors such as valuation, momentum and profitability.



Tax-Advantaged Investing

AQR’s tax advantaged solutions aim to improve the after-tax risk-adjusted returns available to qualified investors globally.
Tax-Advantaged Alternatives



Tax-Advantaged Equity Market Neutral seeks to deliver alpha that is uncorrelated to the market, with a focus on being tax-efficient and potentially tax-beneficial across an investor's entire portfolio.




Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Investing

AQR is committed to helping our clients achieve their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) goals. We provide investors a variety of options to achieve their ESG objectives.

AQR’s ESG Policy


AQR acknowledges that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors may have both direct and indirect impacts on corporate profitability, long-term portfolio performance and risk. With this in mind, our primary objective for considering ESG issues is to improve the financial characteristics of our clients’ investments.
AQR’s ESG framework is built on an economic model that considers ESG issues as externalities imposed on society that are not fully priced into the value of the company or related security. The mispricing of these externalities has the potential to encourage inappropriate corporate decisions - some of which may present investment risks while others may lead to potential profit opportunities.
Research and empiricism are at the core of AQR and we believe in applying an objective research process to evaluate the merits and efficacy of all investment strategies, including ESG criteria. We look for investment criteria or signals that are firmly grounded in economic theory and lead to measurable improvements in risk-adjusted returns.
We recognize that investors may have other motivations for ESG investing, including upholding value or ethical standards and/or promoting ESG accountability of companies to benefit society as a whole. AQR believes it can best address these preferences in client-specific mandates that are customized for each investor’s unique preferences and circumstances.
In applying our ESG Philosophy, AQR has adopted the following guiding principles:

AQR will embrace research and education on ESG criteria in pursuit of continuous improvement to our understanding of the risk and opportunities to our clients, our investment strategies, and our business.
AQR will consider incorporating ESG investment ideas on an equal footing with other investment ideas. In all mandates, ESG investment ideas will be implemented to the extent they are driven by improvement to risk and portfolio return characteristics. In segregated mandates, AQR will also work with clients to implement solutions that reflect client-specific views on moral, social, environmental or governance issues.
AQR will be transparent with respect to its progress on ESG research and implementation solutions.
AQR will ensure it has the resources available to adhere to these guiding principles and to aid clients in their understanding of ESG-based investing.









AQR does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice. Investors should conduct his or her own analysis and consult with professional advisors prior to making any investment decisions.

            Strategy, Benefits, Results
        



            Strategy
        Our strategy is built upon the following Templeton cornerstones, which have been in place for more than 70 years.

Search Globally. We believe bargains have no borders when searching for the best investment opportunities.
Seek Value. We search worldwide for stocks selling at prices we believe are low relative to their true value.
Perform Fundamental, Bottom-Up Research. We conduct in-person visits and perform extensive fundamental research to model a company's potential future earnings, cash flow and asset value relative to its stock price.
Practice Patient, Long-Term Investing. We evaluate a company's potential for earnings and growth over a five-year horizon.



            Benefits
        
Diversification. By investing primarily in international securities, Templeton Foreign Fund can offer diversification to complement the U.S. portion of your portfolio.
Reduced Volatility. Templeton Foreign Fund has historically experienced less volatility than its benchmark, the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Index.
Low Average Turnover Ratio. Our long-term investing approach has historically resulted in a lower than average portfolio turnover ratio.

            Investing In The Fund
        

What Are the Risks?

All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal.
Special risks are associated with foreign investing, including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments; investments in developing markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors.
Currency rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time, and can reduce returns. Because the Fund may invest its assets in companies in a specific region, including Europe, it is subject to greater risks of adverse developments in that region and/or the surrounding regions than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically.
Current political and financial uncertainty surrounding the European Union may increase market volatility and the economic risk of investing in companies in Europe.
Derivatives, including currency management strategies, involve costs and can create economic leverage in the portfolio which may result in significant volatility and cause the fund to participate in losses (as well as enable gains) on an amount that exceeds the fund's initial investment. The fund may not achieve the anticipated benefits, and may realize losses when a counterparty fails to perform as promised.
The fund’s risk considerations are discussed in the prospectus.

Total Returns include change in share price, assume reinvestment of all distributions, and reflect the deduction of fund expenses and applicable fees. Total Returns With Sales Charge: returns reflect the deduction of the stated sales charge. Total returns, distribution rate, and yields reflect any applicable expense reductions, without which the results for those impacted funds would have been lower.
For more information on any of our funds, contact your financial advisor or download a free prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information.  Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
Most Franklin Templeton funds offer multiple share classes. Share classes are subject to different fees and expenses, which will affect their performance. In general, Class A shares have a maximum initial sales charge; Class C shares have a 1% contingent deferred sales charge; Class Z, Advisor Class and Class R6 shares have no sales charges nor Rule 12b-1 fees; Class R shares have no sales charges, but do have a Rule 12b-1 fee.
Advisor Class shares are only offered to certain eligible investors as stated in the prospectus. They are offered without sales charges or Rule 12b-1 fees. The fund offers multiple share classes, which are subject to different fees and expenses that will affect their performance. Please see the prospectus for details.

Footnotes

A statistical measurement of the range of a fund's total returns. In general, a higher standard deviation means greater volatility. Based on the fund's monthly returns over the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A statistical measurement of a fund's historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by taking a fund's excess return over that of the three-month Treasury bill divided by its standard deviation. Higher values generally indicate better historical risk-adjusted performance. Based on the 3 years ended as of the date of the calculation.
The annualized percentage difference between a fund's actual returns and its expected performance given its level of market risk, as measured by beta.  Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
A measure of the fund's volatility relative to the market, as represented by the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Index. A beta greater than 1.00 indicates volatility greater than the market. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Public Offering Price — Purchase price for each share of the fund on a given day. It includes the maximum initial sales charge, if any.
Net Asset Value — The amount per share you would receive if you sold shares that day.

The vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). Placement is determined by fund portfolio holding figures most recently entered into Morningstar's database and corresponding market conditions. Shaded areas show the past 3 years of quarterly data. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
Source: Morningstar®. For each mutual fund and exchange traded fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on how a fund ranks on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure against other funds in the same category. This measure takes into account variations in a fund's monthly performance, and does not take into account the effects of sales charges, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The weights are: 100% 3-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% 5-year rating/40% 3-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 5-year rating/20% 3-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent 3-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Morningstar Rating™ is for the named share class only; other classes may have different performance characteristics. Past performance is not an indicator or a guarantee of future performance.

Percentage of the fund's returns explained by movements in the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Index. 100 equals perfect correlation to the index. Based on the 3-year period ended as of the date of the calculation.
Effective 1/2/97, the fund began offering Advisor Class shares. For periods prior to the fund's Advisor Class inception date, a restated figure is used based on the fund's oldest share class, Class A performance, excluding the effect of Class A's maximum initial sales charge but reflecting the effect of the Class A Rule 12b-1 fees; and for periods after the fund's Advisor Class inception date, actual Advisor Class performance is used, reflecting all charges and fees applicable to that class.
Indices are unmanaged and one cannot invest directly in them. Index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
For performance reporting purposes, the inception date for Classes A, R, R6, Z, and Advisor Class shares of all Franklin Templeton Funds is the date of effectiveness of the fund's registration statement or the first day the fund commenced operations. For Class C shares, generally the inception date is the first day the fund commenced offering such shares. Exceptions: Templeton Global Balanced Fund Classes A and C use the inception date of the old Class A and C shares, renamed Class A1 and Class C1. For Franklin Mutual Series Funds, Franklin International Small Cap Growth Fund and Franklin Pelagos Commodities Strategy Fund, the inception date for Classes A, C, R and R6 shares is the funds' oldest class', Z or Advisor, inception date. Franklin U.S. Government Money Fund Class R6 inception date is the first day it commenced offering such shares. For Franklin California Ultra-Short Tax-Free Income Fund Classes A1 and Advisor Class use the inception date of its predecessor, Franklin California Tax-Exempt Money Fund.
Performance quotations for this class reflect the following methods of calculation: a) For periods prior to the fund's Advisor Class inception date, a restated figure is used based on the fund's oldest share class, Class A performance, excluding the effect of Class A's maximum initial sales charge but reflecting the effect of the Class A Rule 12b-1 fees; and b) for periods after the fund's Advisor Class inception date, actual Advisor Class performance is used, reflecting all charges and fees applicable to that class.
