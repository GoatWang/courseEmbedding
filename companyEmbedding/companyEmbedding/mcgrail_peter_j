What are analysts saying about Paylocity Holding Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Paylocity Holding Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Paylocity offers cloud-based payroll and HCM software solutions to medium-sized organizations. We remain positive about Paylocity’s regular investments in SaaS technology. For the last few quarters, clients moving from traditional payroll service providers to the company’s SaaS-based services contributed significantly to its revenues. Hence, regular investments in technological upgrades, along with product innovation, will continue to boost the company’s top line. Such initiatives should also drive its forthcoming results. Also, higher adoption of Paylocity’s ACA dashboard application, specializing in tracking employee count, employee status and health care plan affordability, will act as a tailwind.However, competition in the payroll processing sector from new entrants as well as existing players remains a major headwind. Notably, Paylocity has underperformed the broader market in the last one year." (7/19/2017)
2. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "Paylocity reported a very good 2Q, with solid revenue outperformance from recurring revenues and better than expected margin leverage with its $0.08 EPS outperformance. Although the future of ACA and the revenue associated with compliance remain a near-term headwind for PCTY, a deeper dive into the company's results show a strong core business ( +33% Y/Y FY17E revenue growth) and a compelling valuation at 4.1x EV/FY18 total revenues or 4.3x EV/FY recurring revenues for a company expected have double digit EBITDA margins and high 20% revenue growth in FY18. New modules continue to enhance the PCTY's product portfolio and we expect can drive consistent ARPU growth over the next several years as highlighted by the strong initial uptake in the company's new Recruiting module."
