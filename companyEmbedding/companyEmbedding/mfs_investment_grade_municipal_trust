Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results.

Important Risk Considerations




The fund may not achieve its objective and/or you could lose money on your investment in the fund.
		





Investments in debt instruments may decline in value as the result of declines in the credit quality of the issuer, borrower, counterparty, or other entity responsible for payment, underlying collateral, or changes in economic, political, issuer-specific, or other conditions.  Certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile.  In addition, debt instruments entail interest rate risk (as interest rates rise, prices usually fall), therefore the Fund's share price may decline during rising rates. Funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations.  At times, and particularly during periods of market turmoil, all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have an active trading market. As a result, it may be difficult to value these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an acceptable price.  The price of an instrument trading at a negative interest rate responds to interest rate changes like other debt instruments; however, an instrument purchased at a negative interest rate is expected to produce a negative return if held to maturity.  
		





Investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, involve leverage (which can magnify losses), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying indicator(s) on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty and liquidity risk.
		





Investments in below investment grade quality debt instruments can be more volatile and have greater risk of default, or already be in default, than higher-quality debt instruments. 
		





Investments in municipal instruments can be volatile and significantly affected by adverse tax or court rulings, legislative or political changes, market and economic conditions, issuer, industry-specific (including the credit quality of municipal insurers), and other conditions.
		





The market price of common shares of the fund will be based on factors such as the supply and demand for common shares in the market and general market, economic, political or regulatory conditions. Whether shareholders will realize gains or losses upon the sale of common shares of the fund will depend on the market price of  common shares at the time of the sale, not on the fund’s net asset value. The market price may be lower or higher than the fund’s net asset value. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount or premium to their net asset value.
		





To the extent that investments are purchased with the issuance of preferred shares, the fund’s net asset value will increase or decrease at a greater rate than a comparable unleveraged fund.
		





Leverage involves investment exposure in an amount exceeding the initial investment. Leverage can cause increased volatility by magnifying gains or losses.

Definitions
Average Effective Duration: Average Effective Duration is a measure of how much a bond’s price is likely to fluctuate with general changes in interest rates, e.g., if rates rise 1.00%, a bond with a 5-year duration is likely to lose about 5.00% of its value.
Average Effective Maturity: Average effective maturity is a weighted average of maturity of the bonds held in a portfolio, taking into account any prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons which may shorten the maturity. Longer-maturity funds are generally considered more interest-rate sensitive than shorter maturity funds.












The Funds are closed-end Funds.  Common shares of the Funds are only available for purchase/sale on the NYSE at the current market price(NYSE-MKT for MFS California Municipal Fund). Shares of the Funds are not FDIC-insured and are not deposits or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, any bank.  Shares of the Funds involve investment risk, including possible loss of principal.

MFS Investment Grade Municipal Trust Announces Tender Offers
























BOSTON, Jul 11, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
MFS Investment Management® (MFS®) announced today that the        
Board 
      of Trustees (the "Board") of MFS Investment Grade Municipal Trust (the 
      "Fund")                 

/quotes/zigman/474512/composite CXH
0.00%


, a closed-end management investment company, 
      authorized the Fund to conduct a cash tender offer (the "Initial Tender 
      Offer") for up to 15 percent of the Fund's outstanding common shares 
      (the “Shares”) at a price per Share equal to 98 percent of the Fund's 
      net asset value (NAV) per Share as of the close of regular trading on 
      the New York Stock Exchange on the date the Initial Tender Offer 
      expires. The Fund expects to commence the Initial Tender Offer on or 
      before August 8, 2017.


                                        








The Board also authorized the Fund to conduct an additional cash tender 
      offer (the “Conditional Tender Offer”) approximately six months after 
      the close of the Initial Tender Offer for up to 7.5 percent of the 
      Fund's then outstanding Shares at a price per share equal to 98 percent 
      of the Fund's NAV per Share as of the close of regular trading on the 
      New York Stock Exchange on the date the Conditional Tender Offer 
      expires, provided that the Conditional Tender Offer will take place only 
      if the average trading discount of the Shares to NAV is greater than 6 
      percent during the period that begins 90 calendar days and ends 180 
      calendar days after the completion of the Initial Tender Offer.


                                        








As of June 30, 2017, the Fund had 11,586,957 shares of common stock 
      outstanding, 1,950 shares of preferred stock outstanding, and total net 
      assets of $122,735,361 (not including preferred shares).


                                        








The Board approved the recommendation of MFS, the Fund's investment 
      adviser, to authorize the Initial Tender Offer and the Conditional 
      Tender Offer (together, the “Tender Offers”) as part of an agreement 
      with a large shareholder of the Fund that agreed to withdraw a 
      shareholder proposal for the Board to consider a tender offer for all of 
      the Fund’s outstanding common shares at or close to NAV. In determining 
      to authorize the Tender Offers as part of such agreement, the Board took 
      into account a variety of factors. These included, among others, the 
      fact that the Initial Tender Offer (and the Conditional Tender Offer, if 
      conducted) may help to reduce the trading discount of the Shares and 
      that, by conducting the Tender Offers at 98% of the NAV of the Shares, 
      the purchase of Shares tendered would be somewhat accretive to the NAV 
      of Shares that remain outstanding immediately following the Tender 
      Offers. The Board also considered that the Fund’s total net assets will 
      decrease as a result of the Initial Tender Offer (and the Conditional 
      Tender Offer, if conducted), which may result in greater volatility, 
      less investment flexibility and proportionately higher expenses for the 
      Fund’s remaining shareholders following the Tender Offers.


                                        








Additional terms and conditions of the Tender Offers will be set forth 
      in the Fund's offering materials. If the number of shares tendered 
      exceeds the maximum amount of either Tender Offer, the Fund will 
      purchase shares from tendering shareholders on a pro-rata basis. 
      Accordingly, there is no assurance that the Fund will purchase all of a 
      shareholder's tendered common shares. The Fund may determine not to 
      accept shares tendered in either Tender Offer under various 
      circumstances, as will be set forth in the offering materials.


                                        








Further information about the Tender Offers will be announced by future 
      press releases. This announcement is for informational purposes only and 
      is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase, or a solicitation of an 
      offer to sell shares of the Fund and is not a prospectus, circular or 
      representation intended for use in the purchase or sale of Fund shares. 
      The Fund has not yet commenced the Tender Offers described in this 
      release. A Tender Offer will be made only by an offer to purchase, a 
      related letter of transmittal, and other documents that will be filed 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as exhibits to a 
      tender offer statement on Schedule TO and will be available free of 
      charge at the SEC's website at         www.sec.gov
. 
      Shareholders should read the applicable offer to purchase and tender 
      offer statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits if and when those 
      documents are filed and become available, as they will contain important 
      information about the particular Tender Offer. The Fund will also make 
      available, without charge, the offer to purchase and the letter of 
      transmittal for each Tender Offer that is conducted.

MFS Investment Grade Municipal Trust Announces Tender Offers






Business Wire




Jul 11, 2017 4:15 PM EDT













 




























































  MFS Investment Management® (MFS®) announced today that the  Board of Trustees (the "Board") of MFS Investment Grade Municipal Trust (the "Fund") (NYSE: CXH), a closed-end management investment company, authorized the Fund to conduct a cash tender offer (the "Initial Tender Offer") for up to 15 percent of the Fund's outstanding common shares (the "Shares") at a price per Share equal to 98 percent of the Fund's net asset value (NAV) per Share as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the date the Initial Tender Offer expires. The Fund expects to commence the Initial Tender Offer on or before August 8, 2017.  The Board also authorized the Fund to conduct an additional cash tender offer (the "Conditional Tender Offer") approximately six months after the close of the Initial Tender Offer for up to 7.5 percent of the Fund's then outstanding Shares at a price per share equal to 98 percent of the Fund's NAV per Share as of the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the date the Conditional Tender Offer expires, provided that the Conditional Tender Offer will take place only if the average trading discount of the Shares to NAV is greater than 6 percent during the period that begins 90 calendar days and ends 180 calendar days after the completion of the Initial Tender Offer.  As of June 30, 2017, the Fund had 11,586,957 shares of common stock outstanding, 1,950 shares of preferred stock outstanding, and total net assets of $122,735,361 (not including preferred shares).  The Board approved the recommendation of MFS, the Fund's investment adviser, to authorize the Initial Tender Offer and the Conditional Tender Offer (together, the "Tender Offers") as part of an agreement with a large shareholder of the Fund that agreed to withdraw a shareholder proposal for the Board to consider a tender offer for all of the Fund's outstanding common shares at or close to NAV. In determining to authorize the Tender Offers as part of such agreement, the Board took into account a variety of factors. These included, among others, the fact that the Initial Tender Offer (and the Conditional Tender Offer, if conducted) may help to reduce the trading discount of the Shares and that, by conducting the Tender Offers at 98% of the NAV of the Shares, the purchase of Shares tendered would be somewhat accretive to the NAV of Shares that remain outstanding immediately following the Tender Offers. The Board also considered that the Fund's total net assets will decrease as a result of the Initial Tender Offer (and the Conditional Tender Offer, if conducted), which may result in greater volatility, less investment flexibility and proportionately higher expenses for the Fund's remaining shareholders following the Tender Offers.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
