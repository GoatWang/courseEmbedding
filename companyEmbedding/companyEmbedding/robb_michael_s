The Jay Robb Diet Plan Overview
Whether you admit it or not, you want to look fantastic. There is nothing wrong with this mindset. It is not an egotistic facet of your existence or a narcissistic adventure. Looking and feeling your best is inherent to your core being. You are naturally programmed to be your best. We all are. So don’t hold back. My system works and NOW is the time to take action. Go for it. My 3-Step Plan is easy to follow and can change your life in 3 days or less…
STEP 1: Shape Your Thinking
My job is to get you in the best shape of your life, and the first step is to help you gain control over your thoughts. The way you think determines your destiny in life and is reflected by you and your surroundings. I feel that most people do not realize his or her full potential because they have NO CONTROL over their thoughts. To get in your best shape requires you to have control over your thoughts. Thought control is the trait ALL successful people possess. Click here to read more.
STEP 2: Shape Your Eating
You are what you eat, (at least in the physical sense), which is why it is CRITCAL that you eat natural foods. Exercise is not the best way to lose weight. Exercise is however, important for toning your muscles and for getting you physically fit. Your DIET (not exercise) is your best means for losing weight and keeping it off. Never indulge in the erroneous thought that exercise is your weight-loss elixir. It is not. What you eat is what you get. Every bite of food you take and everything you drink creates the physical you. I will show you the foods to eat that will make you look like a million dollars (before taxes) and I will also show you foods that will make you look fluffy, puffy, and bankrupt.

STEP 3: Shape Your Body
Exercise is the third step in the process of YOU looking and feeling your absolute best. Your diet is your fat melter and exercise is your body shaper. Exercise allows a woman to create a firm, sexy body that has the curves and contour of a movie star or glamour model. For guys, exercise can build big arms, tight abs, a wide back and powerful thighs. Exercise keeps men and women young, healthy and happy. Exercise is critical but you must exercise properly or you will waste your time, injure yourself, or create an out-of-balance body. Click here to read more.
