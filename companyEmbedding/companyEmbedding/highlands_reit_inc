InvenTrust Properties Corp. Completes Spin-off of Highlands REIT, Inc. | Business Wire


























































InvenTrust Properties Corp. Completes Spin-off of Highlands REIT, Inc.




Takes Next Step Toward Becoming a Pure-Play Retail REIT






April 28, 2016 06:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time



OAK BROOK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--InvenTrust Properties Corp. (“InvenTrust” or “the Company”) today 
      announced that it has successfully completed the spin-off of Highlands 
      REIT, Inc. (“Highlands”) through the pro rata distribution of 100% of 
      Highlands common stock to InvenTrust stockholders of record on April 25, 
      2016. On April 28, 2016, the distribution date, each InvenTrust 
      stockholder received one share of Highlands common stock for every share 
      of InvenTrust common stock held of record on April 25, 2016. As reported 
      by Highlands in its Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on 
      April 28, 2016, the Board of Directors of Highlands has established an 
      estimated per share value of the Highlands common stock equal to $0.36 
      per share as of April 28, 2016. Following the distribution, InvenTrust 
      no longer owns any shares of common stock of Highlands.
    


      “This is the next step in executing our long-term portfolio strategy,” 
      said Thomas P. McGuinness, President and CEO of InvenTrust. “This event 
      brings InvenTrust closer to becoming a pure-play retail REIT, while also 
      allowing the management teams at both companies to focus solely on their 
      portfolio of assets to maximize value for the stockholders. I would also 
      like to wish Richard Vance and his team at Highlands all the best as 
      they embark on their future as an independent company.”
    

      Highlands is an independent, self-managed, non-traded REIT with a 
      dedicated management team focused on preserving, protecting and 
      maximizing the total value of its portfolio. Highlands’ portfolio 
      consists of seven single- and multi-tenant office assets, two industrial 
      assets, six retail assets, two correctional facilities, four parcels of 
      unimproved land and one bank branch.
    

Terms of the Spin-Off


      InvenTrust stockholders now own shares in both InvenTrust and Highlands. 
      The number of InvenTrust shares held by stockholders did not change as a 
      result of the distribution of Highlands common stock. Shares of 
      Highlands common stock were distributed in book-entry form only. No 
      physical share certificates of Highlands will be issued. There is no 
      current trading market for the Highlands common stock, and Highlands 
      does not intend to list any shares of its common stock on any securities 
      exchange or other market in connection with the distribution.
    

      Although the distribution of the outstanding shares of Highlands common 
      stock was in the form of a taxable distribution to InvenTrust 
      stockholders, InvenTrust does not anticipate recognizing a taxable gain 
      as a result of the distribution. As a result, InvenTrust anticipates 
      that the distribution will not increase its earnings and profits for 
      2016. Accordingly, so long as stockholders own InvenTrust common stock 
      for the entire year in 2016, InvenTrust anticipates that the 
      distribution of Highlands common stock will not increase the amount of 
      dividend income stockholders will recognize for 2016 compared to the 
      amount of dividend income InvenTrust stockholders would have recognized 
      if the distribution had not occurred.
    

      An Information Statement containing the details of the spin-off and 
      important information about Highlands, including its business, financial 
      condition and operations and risks related to its business, has been 
      mailed to InvenTrust stockholders as of the record date. We urge you to 
      read the Information Statement carefully. InvenTrust stockholders are 
      also encouraged to consult their financial advisors and tax advisors 
      regarding the particular consequences of the distribution in their 
      situation and the applicability and effect of any U.S. federal, state, 
      local and foreign tax laws.
    

InvenTrust Estimated Share Valuation


      InvenTrust expects to announce its new estimated share value in early 
      May 2016, which will reflect the spin-off of Highlands. InvenTrust has 
      engaged an independent, third-party valuation firm to assist in the 
      valuation. InvenTrust will provide a detailed explanation of the 
      valuation method, analysis and process used by the valuation firm to 
      estimate the new per share value. As a result of the Highlands spin-off, 
      InvenTrust expects the value of the shares of InvenTrust stock to be 
      lower, as the value of InvenTrust common stock will no longer reflect 
      the value of the Highlands portfolio. Once the new estimated share value 
      is determined, InvenTrust will file a Current Report on Form 8-K and 
      disclose to stockholders the new estimated share value and how the 
      estimated share value was calculated and determined.
    

ABOUT INVENTRUST PROPERTIES CORP.


      InvenTrust became a self-managed REIT in 2014 and as of December 31, 
      2015, is an owner and operator of 112 multi-tenant retail properties. 
      InvenTrust’s total retail portfolio comprises of 18.5 million square 
      feet of retail space in 24 states. As of December 31, 2015, the Company 
      also owned 11,039 student housing beds and 5.7 million square feet of 
      non-core space. The pending sale of the Company’s student housing 
      platform is expected to close by the end of the second quarter 2016.
    

Forward-Looking Statements Disclaimer


      Forward-Looking Statements in this press release, which are not 
      historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of 
      the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking 
      statements are statements that are not historical, including statements 
      regarding management’s intentions, beliefs, expectations, plans or 
      predictions of the future and are typically identified by words such as 
      “may,” “could,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “seek,” “anticipate,” 
      “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “likely,” 
      “will,” “would” and variations of these terms and similar expressions, 
      or the negative of these terms or similar expressions. These statements 
      include statements about our plans and strategies and future events, 
      including statements concerning Highlands’ published estimated per share 
      value of Highlands common stock, the anticipated tax consequences of the 
      spin-off; the sale of University House, the anticipated timing to close 
      the University House transaction, and anticipated timing with respect to 
      publishing our new estimated share value, among other things. Such 
      forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and 
      assumptions that, while considered reasonable by us and our management, 
      are inherently uncertain and involve known and unknown risks that are 
      difficult to predict. For further discussion of factors that could 
      materially affect the outcome of our forward-looking statements and our 
      future results and financial condition, see the Risk Factors included in 
      InvenTrust’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as updated by any 
      subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in each case as filed with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission, and the registration statement on 
      Form 10 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by Highlands 
      REIT, Inc. InvenTrust intends that such forward-looking statements be 
      subject to the safe harbors created by Section 27A of the Securities Act 
      of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 
      1934, as amended, except as may be required by applicable law. We 
      caution you not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking 
      statements, which are made as of the date of this press release. We 
      undertake no obligation to update publicly any of these forward-looking 
      statements to reflect actual results, new information or future events, 
      changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting 
      forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable 
      laws. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference 
      should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to 
      those or other forward-looking statements.
    

      This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the 
      solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.

Overview
The Direxion Daily MSCI Real Estate Bull and Bear 3X Shares seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the MSCI US REIT Index. There is no guarantee the funds will meet their stated investment objective.
These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 300% or -300% of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. The funds should not be expected to provide three times or negative three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview
The Direxion Daily MSCI Real Estate Bull and Bear 3X Shares seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the MSCI US REIT Index. There is no guarantee the funds will meet their stated investment objective.
These leveraged ETFs seek a return that is 300% or -300% of the return of their benchmark index for a single day. The funds should not be expected to provide three times or negative three times the return of the benchmark’s cumulative return for periods greater than a day.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI US REIT Index (RMS G) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is comprised of equity real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) that are included in the MSCI US Investable Market 2500 Index, with the exception of specialty equity REITs that do not generate a majority of their revenue and income from real estate rental and leasing operations. The Index represents approximately 99% of the U.S. REIT universe. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Our portfolio consists of seven office assets, two industrial assets, six retail assets, two correctional facilities, four parcels of unimproved land and one bank branch. This portfolio largely represented the non-core assets of InvenTrust Properties Corp., our former parent, which spun off Highlands REIT in 2016. The spin-off allowed InvenTrust’s management to focus on its core portfolio while providing Highlands with a dedicated management team to focus on maximizing the value of our portfolio.
