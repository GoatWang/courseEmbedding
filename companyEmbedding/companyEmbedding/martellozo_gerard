Gérard Martellozo

Chairman and Director
Gérard Martellozo is vice president, human resources (HR) for Schlumberger Limited, located in London, United Kingdom. Prior to this appointment he was senior advisor to the chief executive officer of Schlumberger, based in Houston, Texas, United States.
Gérard joined Schlumberger in 1979 after completing a Masters of Engineering at the Ecole Nationale Superieure de l'Aeronautique et de l'Espace (Sup'Aero), France. He began his oilfield career as a wireline field engineer, quickly progressing into operations management with assignments in Spain, Italy, France, Nigeria, Algeria and Venezuela. He then transitioned into personnel, and during the next twenty years worked with most of the company’s oilfield services business sectors. From 2010 to 2012 he was personnel manager of the company’s drilling group, and during this time was responsible for integrating the organizations of several major oilfield services companies purchased by Schlumberger including Smith, M-I and Geoservices.
He is one of the founders of Partnerjob.com, for which he has served as treasurer since 2003. This is a non-profit association that includes several major corporations and organizations that value global mobility and spouse support as members. It aims to facilitate the geographical mobility of dual-career partners by offering a worldwide database where employers can connect with international candidates and where talented candidates can find global job opportunities. Gérard joined the board of the Foundation in March 2014 to continue to lend his support to the Schlumberger long-term commitment to promoting women in technology in the world at large.
