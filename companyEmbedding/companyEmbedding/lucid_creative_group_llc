National Gallery of Art: The “Bulletin” Magazine
The Bulletin is the National Gallery of Art’s biannual magazine with articles on upcoming exhibitions, significant works of art, or other Gallery-related news and information. It also highlights new art acquisitions, and current and future exhibitions. LUCID developed a new template for this publication and has designed all subsequent issues over the last decade.


































































GeoEye: Corporate Identity & Collateral
When Dulles-based Orbimage acquired Denver’s Space Imaging, Inc., LUCID was enlisted to develop a new look for the new company, now named GeoEye. The new identity needed to be modern and corporate, as part of new company’s mission to appeal to clients outside the government sector.LUCID continued to support GeoEye’s marketing and communication teams with a plethora of solutions over several years. GeoEye was the world’s largest commercial satellite imaging company until they combined with DigitalGlobe, now a LUCID client.LUCID was proud to watch live as one of our logos launched into space on the rocket for the GeoEye-1 satellite. LUCID now has 2 logos in orbit, likely a world record.


























































































H St. Country Club: Restaurant Identity
The H Street Country Club needed a logo and accompanying identity package that managed to somehow describe them. The trick is they aren’t your typical country club. They are instead a large restaurant in the urban neighborhood known as the Atlas District in Washington, DC. With a wild, colorful and wonderfully playful interior designed by Lee Wheeler, a 9-hole miniature golf course, pool tables, skee ball, shuffle board, two bars serving delicious and inventive cocktails, a rooftop deck and a kitchen serving authentic Mexican food. We developed a logo that hinted at traditional country club seals, but was contrasted with an urban, cartoony flavor.    LUCID was subsequently hired to design stationery, menus, uniforms, custom golf balls, a golf score card, exterior signage, a website and other materials. We also photographed the restaurant, the food and the owners for the website and media kit. As a part of the branding project for the launch of H Street Country Club, we designed a simple, functional website.
























































































































American University: Naming, Identity & Collateral for $200-million Fundraising Campaign
American University asked LUCID to develop a name, a brand and identity standards for their $200-million, 5-year fund-raising campaign. We presented several themes, with “AnewAU” as our recommended selection. We felt that a sense of newness, freshness, and a forward-looking approach was the right way to position this campaign. Our logotype was designed to be clean, distinctive and versatile, as well as to work with AU’s existing identity guidelines. We also developed identity standards specifically for campaign materials, to be used by all internal and external designers.    LUCID continued to provide support to AU and most of AU’s schools throughout the successful campaign, creating countless products including case statements, banners, stationery, podium graphics, presentation graphics, brochures, special event materials, newsletters, magazines, appeals and so much more.
























































































































Georgetown University: Leadership Annual Report
Georgetown University hired LUCID to produce an annual report which would also serve to profile several major donors and express gratitude to all supporters of the university. Photography was coordinated across the country through Georgetown’s publications office under our art direction.




































Woolly Mammoth: Campaign Identity & Collateral
Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company is the epicenter of challenging new theater in Washington, DC, producing original works on their new multi-million dollar downtown stage. With a dramatic increase in overhead, the common pitfall for a risk-taking theater is to start playing it safe—to go mainstream. Woolly Mammoth launched a major capital campaign to provide the theatre with the means to avoid losing what has made it so successful, namely the willingness to experiment.    Zane Carter, formerly of Carter/Cosgove, was enlisted to name the campaign. The team settled on the energetic and surprising solution, “Free the Beast!” LUCID was subsequently commissioned to develop the tag line and produce the visual identity for this campaign, starting with a logotype and stationery package. LUCID continued to support the campaign through its successful completion.
















































Library of Congress: Dresden Exhibition Catalog
The Library of Congress hosted an exhibit of precious works from the Saxon State Library in Dresden. For this event, a catalog containing a collection of essays as well as plates showcasing the content of the exhibit was commissioned.    This book design received an AIGA50 award, crediting it as one of the 50 best designed pieces in Washington DC, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia over a 2-year period. It also received an award from the Washington Book Publishers.










































Icarus: Restaurant Identity
When established Boston-based restaurant Icarus made the decision to raise the quality of an already excellent restaurant, they called on LUCID to help rebrand them. We developed a simple logotype with an embedded reference to their namesake. In addition to the logo, we designed their stationery, menus, menu covers and other promotional items.










































Henry Shawah: Retrospective Art Book
LUCID was hired to design a book to commemorate the life and work of Henry Shawah, one of America’s greatest goldsmiths, loved by people as diverse as the Queen of England and Julia Child. Henry has been forging unique and special jewelry, objects, and sculptures by hand for decades. Only a very special book would suffice in honoring his legacy.


















































































































United States Geological Survey: Identity & Identity Standards
The U.S. Geological Survey is the governmental agency with responsibilities for several areas of science, including biology, geography, geology, geospatial and hydrology. Their name and numerous brands and seals, however, presented a fractured image to the general public. Faced with a lack of awareness by the U.S. Congress, the USGS needed to rebrand all of its divisions under a unified identifier in order to clarify the breadth of its value to U.S. tax payers. A mark and tagline which spoke to all of their responsibilities was necessary. It was also helpful to focus on their acronym, not their full name.A LUCID principal was a senior member of the design team, working with former communications firm Garruba Dennis Konetzka and a group of internal constituents and designers from the agency itself. In addition to playing a significant role in the design process for the identity, our principal had primary responsibility for the identity standards development.






















































Urban Institute: Book Covers
The Urban Institute publishes numerous books on topics related to social issues and policy, such as urban sprawl, teen pregnancy, the subprime mortgage crisis, public housing, race, education, tax policy, etc. LUCID designed almost all of their book covers. Several examples of the countless covers we’ve designed are presented here, with more to come...

My wife and I love our Lucid memory foam topper! I am getting way better sleep than ever before and the second I hit the mattress to go to sleep I seriously feel like I am on a cloud.

    Picture frames are some of the most classic décor accessories, and for good reason. Photo frames let you display images of everything from family and
    friends to events and occasions, keeping pictures of treasured people and memories close at hand. In addition, picture frames come in a huge range of
    designs from simple and classic white or black frames to collage frames, and boldly styled statement frames.


    Decorative pillows are another very popular option in décor accessories, and are a versatile addition that can be placed pretty much anywhere that people
    sit, lounge or relax. Throw pillows can add a pop of color, fun patterns, and a bit of extra cushion to a space. Or, for a more utilitarian touch than
    pillows provide, decorative baskets and boxes can act as functional décor that can help keep an area organized while also adding color or texture to
    storage space.


    If you’re looking to add a soothing, spa-like feel to your décor, indoor fountains can not only add to your spaces appearance, but can bring a calming
    sound that makes any room feel more relaxing. Alternately, for a quieter element that still adds to stress-free feel, botanical additions can bring an
    element of the outdoors in, adding bright and cheery colors, and making a space feel more vibrant. Our selection of permanent flowers, plants, and trees do
    one better than nature by providing all of the ambiance and color of real plants, but without the maintenance or any imperfections.


    There are an enormous number of other interior décor elements to choose from as well, including statues and figurines, globes, decorative plates or bowls,
    jewelry and music boxes, and many other products. Browse our wide selection of home décor accessories to find the ones that speak to you, and let
    themine.com help bring all that’s good to your home.

About Rugs


		Rugs are versatile floor coverings that can make a great addition to nearly any design; they can complement or replace carpets to add both comfort and style, provide extra insulation, dampen sound and even add a bit of safety to smooth or slippery floors.
		

		When deciding what rug might be right, be sure to consider the appearance of the rug, the size and shape of the room, the amount of traffic and the ambiance you want to create.
		

		Considering the size and shape of your space and your current carpeting is important for ensuring the proper scale, though there are a couple different approaches to scale. For example, you can select a rug that leaves a perimeter of about one and a half feet to achieve a wall-to-wall carpeted feel, or tie bedroom and seating groups together by choosing a rug that extends underneath the larger furniture pieces. Runners in hallways or entryways should also leave a perimeter, usually between three and six inches, though you can accent different areas of your home with clever runner placement as well.
		

		Traffic and ambience are also things you should take into account when choosing rug material and pile. Low-pile carpet made of synthetic materials is a durable option for spaces with heavy foot traffic, but if you’re going for comfort in an area that isn’t a thoroughfare, a higher pile or shag rug made of wool or silk can add a lot of luxury to the space.
		

		No matter the rug size or type, don’t forget to make sure it stays safely in place. A rug pad is the best way to keep any rug from sliding around on tile, concrete or wood floors, and come in a range of sizes that can work with any space.
