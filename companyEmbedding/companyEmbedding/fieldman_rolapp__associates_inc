	About Us - Fieldman, Rolapp & AssociatesFieldman, Rolapp & Associates  






































 



















About Us
With a more than 50-year legacy in providing independent financial advice and services to all levels of public agencies on intricate financing and investment activities, Fieldman, Rolapp & Associates, Inc. (FRA) is a trusted resource for financial services that are effective and practical.
Meet Our Team 






We are often asked what makes our firm different from many others.
The answer is simple, EIS, Experience, Integrity and Service.







Experience: A lot has changed since 1966 when FRA was founded. One thing that has not changed is the role that FRA serves for its clients. The continuity and independence that clients have come to expect from FRA is an approach that has been handed down over several generations of public finance leaders. FRA regularly ranks near the top in California for the number of deals successfully completed, while also regularly ranking near the top in par amount of transactions completed. This unique combination makes it a key differentiator for FRA. Our deal velocity gives us rich experience with a broad range of topics and experience advising on structures that are typically only seen in larger transactions. As a result, FRA offers a depth of knowledge and experience that is hard to find in an ever-changing environment.
Integrity: FRA prides itself on always looking out for our clients’ best interests.  At times, we introduce innovation into a transaction to help lower the cost of borrowing or reduce risk. In other instances – when the risks outweigh the benefits – we have advised our clients to not move forward with a transaction.
Service: We offer customized financial advice that has distinguished our firm from our competitors by using the 80/20 approach to service delivery. We believe that approximately 80% of what our clients will need on a transaction is predictable, based our extensive experience in the industry. We make sure we take care of the 80% ahead of schedule so that we can manage the 20% that is unique and requires quick, decisive action. This also enables our most senior team members to provide in-person support for our clients.
FRA has proven success supporting clients with land-based, utility and school financings, water agencies, cities and counties, school districts and utilities.
Since inception, we have been centered on upholding strong ethical values and superb client service. We consistently earn a clean bill of health from the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and advocate for regulatory legislature that protects our public sector clients.
FRA is a founding member of the National Association of Municipal Advisors (NAMA), the trade association that fosters standards and best practices for municipal financial advisors. FRA is also a Registered Municipal Advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).
