James P. Clappin















President, Corning Glass Technologies
James P. Clappin is president of Corning Glass Technologies (CGT). Comprising CGT are Corning’s Display Technologies and Specialty Materials businesses, which includes Corning’s growing Gorilla® Glass for handheld, IT and large cover glass applications.
Clappin joined Corning Incorporated in 1980 as a process engineer. He transitioned to GTE Corporation in 1983 and returned to Corning in 1988. He held a variety of manufacturing management roles in the consumer products division, transferring to the display business in 1994. After progressing through management positions, he was appointed general manager of Corning Display Technologies (CDT) in 2002, and was president of CDT from September 2005 to July 2010. Under his leadership, CDT’s sales increased by a factor of seven between 2002 and 2010.
Clappin’s organization has led the development of new technologies for advanced displays and mobile devices, including EAGLE XG® glass substrates, Corning® Gorilla® Glass, Corning Lotus™ Glass substrates for OLED and high-performance displays, and Corning® Willow™ Glass.
Clappin holds a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from the University of Rhode Island. In 2013, he received a Distinguished Achievement Award from the University of Rhode Island’s College of Engineering.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
