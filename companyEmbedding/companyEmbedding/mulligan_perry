While the affected individuals and organizations are struggling with the very tangible business impact of the loss of revenue and operations, it’s critical to step back and review what else one could do to mitigate and minimize the damage from such attacks in...Jul. 26, 2017 06:15 PM EDT  Reads: 438Legacy Modernization: Cloud and Open SystemsBy Astadia CloudGPSIf you are thinking about moving applications off a mainframe and over to open systems and the cloud, consider these guidelines to prioritize what to move and what to eliminate. On the surface, mainframe architecture seems relatively simple: A centrally located computer processes data through an input/output subsystem and stores its computations in memory. At the other end of the mainframe are pri...Jul. 26, 2017 05:00 PM EDT  Reads: 1,316What Business Leaders Need to Know About MLBy William SchmarzoSometimes I write a blog just to formulate and organize a point of view, and I think it’s time that I pull together the bounty of excellent information about Machine Learning.

Machine learning is a key capability that...Jul. 26, 2017 04:45 PM EDT  Reads: 289Brain Change and Digital StrategiesBy Kevin BenedictThe renowned military strategist John Boyd taught that people and institutions collect favorite philosophies, strategies, theories and ideologies over a period of time, and then try to align the future to fit them.  The problem with this is the future is rarely like the past, and trying to fit new data into old paradigms often forces us to perform irrational mental gymnastics, which leaves us fart...Jul. 26, 2017 04:15 PM EDT  Reads: 302DX and Competitive Decision MakingBy Kevin BenedictThe winning trinity in competitive decision-making includes people, ideas and things according to the renowned military strategist John Boyd.

By Automic BlogWith continuous delivery (CD) almost always in the spotlight, continuous integration (CI) is often left out in the cold. Indeed, it's been in use for so long and so widely, we often take the model for granted. So what is CI and how can you make the most of it? This blog is intended to answer those questions.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies.

Stress-O-Pedic chooses Freudenberg's FR fabric 
David Perry, May 30, 2005
 


         Bedding producer Stress-O-Pedic said it is using Freudenberg's Celestia flame-retardant material in its bedding lines.
Freudenberg said the producer began using its FR fabric at the beginning of this year, when California's new open flame resistance law took effect.








This marks the first publicly identified bedding customer for Freudenberg's FR products. Only a handful of bedding producers have revealed which FR suppliers they are working with.
Stress-O-Pedic is using Celestia on its Stress-O-Pedic and Select Rest mattress designs.
Mike Mulligan, president and CEO of Stress-O-Pedic, said he chose Celestia based on its demonstrated ability to meet California's requirements, while allowing the company's mattress designs to retain all of their visual and physical properties.
"Before making our decision," he said, "we tested numerous FR products to ensure that the presence of an added material would not have an adverse effect on the aesthetics or performance of the mattress itself. We found that the physical presence of the Celestia FR material was virtually imperceptible, while offering superior protection for our customers."
Mulligan said that other FR products tested "tended to nullify the surface comfort." And he said that Celestia contains no chemicals that could be harmful.
"These factors, combined with the long-standing reputations of both Freudenberg and their strategic partner, Hickory Springs Converting of North Carolina, finalized our decision," he said.
Stress-O-Pedic includes open-flame FR protection on all beds, not just those sold in California. "We believe the public deserves all the safety we can give them when they buy our product," Mulligan said.
