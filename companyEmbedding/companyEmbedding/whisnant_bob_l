Headwaters Incorporated Announces Management Changes in Its Light 
      Building Product Segment






January 10, 2011 06:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SOUTH JORDAN, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HEADWATERS INCORPORATED (NYSE: HW) today announced changes to the 
      management structure in its Light Building Products business. Effective 
      immediately, Jack Lawless has been reassigned as advisor to Headwaters 
      Incorporated and to Chief Executive Officer, Kirk A. Benson. Mr. Lawless 
      had formerly served as President of Headwaters’ Light Building Products. 
      David Ulmer has been named as President of Tapco International, a 
      division of Light Building Products. David previously served as 
      Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing for the Tapco division. 
      Mr. Ulmer has held increasingly responsible positions in his 20 plus 
      years in the building products industry. David's leadership and 
      experience have resulted in a very successful track record in multiple 
      areas, including: sales, marketing, operations and international 
      business functions. Murphy Lents will continue in his role as President 
      of Eldorado Stone, and Bob Whisnant will remain President of Southwest 
      Concrete Products. Messrs. Ulmer, Lents and Whisnant will all report 
      directly to Mr. Benson.
    


      “We are very pleased that Jack has accepted this new assignment,” said 
      Kirk Benson. “Jack’s twenty one years of experience in the Light 
      Building Products industry is of great value to us. We look forward to 
      his guidance and expertise in his new role as advisor to Headwaters.”
    

      Mr. Lawless joined Tapco International in 1989 and served in various 
      executive positions there until he was appointed President in 1998, the 
      position he held when Headwaters acquired Tapco in 2004. He was named 
      President of the Light Building Products division, which includes Tapco, 
      Eldorado Stone and Southwest Concrete Products, when the business 
      segment was formed in 2007.
    

About Headwaters Incorporated


Headwaters Incorporated’s vision is to improve sustainability by 
      transforming underutilized resources into valuable products. Headwaters 
      is a diversified growth company providing products, technologies and 
      services to the heavy construction materials, light building products, 
      and energy technology industries. Through its coal combustion 
      products, building products, and energy businesses, the Company earns a 
      revenue stream that helps to provide the capital to fund growth of 
      existing and new business opportunities.


Forward Looking Statements


Certain statements contained in this press release are 
      forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
      and Headwaters intends that such forward-looking statements be subject 
      to the safe-harbor created thereby. Forward-looking statements 
      include Headwaters’ expectations as to the managing and marketing of 
      coal combustion products, the production and marketing of building 
      materials and products, the production and marketing of cleaned coal, 
      the licensing of residue hydrocracking technology and catalyst sales to 
      oil refineries, the availability of refined coal tax credits, the 
      development, commercialization, and financing of new technologies and 
      other strategic business opportunities and acquisitions, and other 
      information about Headwaters. Such statements that are not purely 
      historical by nature, including those statements regarding Headwaters’ 
      future business plans, the operation of facilities, the availability of 
      feedstocks, and the marketability of the coal combustion products, 
      building products, cleaned coal, catalysts, and the availability of tax 
      credits, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the 
      Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding future events 
      and our future results that are based on current expectations, 
      estimates, forecasts, and projections about the industries in which we 
      operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Actual 
      results may vary materially from such expectations. Words such as 
      “may,” “should,” “intends,” “plans,” “expects,” “anticipates,” 
      “targets,” “goals,” “projects,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” 
      “forecasts,” or variations of such words and similar expressions, or the 
      negative of such terms, may help identify such forward-looking 
      statements. Any statements that refer to projections of our 
      future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our 
      businesses, and other characterizations of future events or 
      circumstances, are forward-looking. In addition to matters affecting the 
      coal combustion products, building products, and energy industries or 
      the economy generally, factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      from expectations stated in forward-looking statements include, among 
      others, the factors described in the caption entitled “Risk Factors” in 
      Item 1A in Headwaters’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 
      ended September 30, 2010, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and other 
      periodic filings and prospectuses.


Although Headwaters believes that its expectations are based on 
      reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its 
      business and operations, there can be no assurance that our results of 
      operations will not be adversely affected by such factors. Unless 
      legally required, we undertake no obligation to revise or update any 
      forward-looking statements for any reason. Readers are cautioned 
      not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which 
      speak only as of the date of this press release. Our internet address is www.headwaters.com. 
      There we make available, free of charge, our annual report on Form 10-K, 
      quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any 
      amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after 
      we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
Our reports can be accessed through the investor relations section of 
      our web site.
