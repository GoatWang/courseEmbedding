          The initial customer ratings and reviews for this product (those dated before 3/18/2013) were provided to Fidelity through an email solicitation for feedback on the product. All ratings and reviews are provided to Fidelity on a voluntarily basis and are screened in accordance with the guidelines set forth in our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. For additional information on which ratings and reviews may be posted, please refer to our Customer Ratings and Review Terms of Use. Featured Reviews have been selected based on subjective criteria and reviewed by Fidelity Investments. The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of use and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted. Ratings and reviews are added continuously to the website (after a delay for screening against guidelines) and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed.


          The ratings and experience of customers may not be representative of the experiences of all customers or investors and is not indicative of future success. The accuracy of information included in the customer ratings and reviews cannot be guaranteed by Fidelity Investments. Customers who post ratings may be responsible for disclosing whether they have a financial interest or conflict in submitting a rating and review.
	
    

          Please contact a Fidelity representative if you have additional questions or concerns about the ratings and reviews posted here.

THE INCOME ACCESS RIDER � You are requesting to add the optional Income Access Rider to your contract. To add the rider to your contract, you
must enroll, or be enrolled, in Portfolio Optimization (an asset allocation program established and maintained by Pacific Life for this rider) and meet the minimum requirements on the date this form is signed. THE ADDITION OF THIS
RIDER WILL BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF THIS REQUEST IS RECEIVED IN GOOD ORDER BY PACIFIC LIFE WITHIN 60 DAYS OF THE CONTRACT ISSUE DATE OR 30 DAYS AFTER ANY CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY. THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS RIDER WILL BE ON THE CONTRACT ISSUE DATE OR ON
THAT CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY. See instructions for additional requirements and product availability. �


��
�
Terms and Conditions By adding the Income Access Rider to the contract, I understand that: �


�
(a)
�
the entire contract value must be invested according to an asset allocation program established and maintained by Pacific Life for this rider.
�


�
(b)
�
the rider will terminate on the contract anniversary following the day any portion of the contract value is no longer invested according to the asset allocation
program. �


�
(c)
�
the withdrawal provisions under my contract are not changed or replaced and will be subject to the same conditions, restrictions and limitations as withdrawals
otherwise made under the provisions of the contract. 


�



�
(d)
�
withdrawals that total more than the protected payment amount (7% gross of protected payment base) in a given contract year, may result in reduced benefits provided
under this rider and that the amounts initially protected may no longer be guaranteed. �


�
(e)
�
withdrawals and other distributions of taxable amounts will be subject to income tax, and if taken prior to age 591/2, a 10% federal tax may
apply. �


�
(f)
�
on each contract anniversary, an annual charge equal to 0.30% of the contract value will be deducted from my contract for the prior year. The annual charge may
change if I elect a step-up in the remaining protected balance, however it will not exceed the annual charge then being offered for the same product under newly-issued riders. �


�
(g)
�
if the rider terminates for reasons other than for death or annuitization, the entire annual charge then in effect for the rider will be deducted from the contract
on the date the rider terminates. �

�
ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND SIGNATURE(S) �


��
�
I have received and read the applicable product prospectus describing the optional Income Access Rider and understand the terms and conditions under Section 2. I
have discussed this rider with the appropriate parties, possibly including, but not limited to, my registered representative and tax adviser and believe that this rider meets my insurable needs and objectives. �


��
�
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADDITION OF THIS RIDER WILL BE EFFECTIVE ONLY IF THIS REQUEST IS RECEIVED IN GOOD ORDER BY PACIFIC LIFE WITHIN 60 DAYS OF THE CONTRACT ISSUE
DATE OR 30 DAYS AFTER ANY CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY. THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS RIDER WILL BE ON THE CONTRACT ISSUE DATE OR ON THAT CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY. IF THIS REQUEST IS NOT RECEIVED IN GOOD ORDER WITHIN THIS TIMEFRAME, THE INCOME ACCESS RIDER WILL
NOT BE ADDED. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE RIDER IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR MY CONTRACT, IT WILL NOT BE ADDED. ONCE IT BECOMES AVAILABLE, I UNDERSTAND THAT I WILL NEED TO SUBMIT A NEW REQUEST, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THEN IN EFFECT FOR THE RIDER.

Pacific Odyssey Fees Fact Sheet






Investors should carefully consider a variable annuity's risks, charges, limitations, and expenses, as well as the risks, charges, expenses, and investment goals of the underlying investment options. This and other information about Pacific Life are provided in the product and underlying fund prospectuses. These prospectuses should be read carefully before investing.
The value of the variable investment options will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Annuity withdrawals and other distributions of taxable amounts, including death benefit payouts, will be subject to ordinary income tax. For nonqualified contracts, an additional 3.8% federal tax may apply on net investment income. If withdrawals and other distributions are taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% federal tax may apply. A withdrawal charge also may apply. Withdrawals will reduce the contract value and the value of the death benefits, and also may reduce the value of any optional benefits.
Pacific Life is a product provider. It is not a fiduciary and therefore does not give advice or make recommendations regarding insurance or investment products. Only an advisor who is also a fiduciary is required to advise if the product purchase and any subsequent action taken with regard to the product are in their client's best interest.
Check the background of your financial professional on FINRA's BrokerCheck.
Variable insurance products are distributed by Pacific Select Distributors, LLC (member FINRA & SIPC), a subsidiary of Pacific Life Insurance Company (Newport Beach, CA) and an affiliate of Pacific Life & Annuity Company, and are available through licensed third parties.

Pacific Life Annuities
	Pacific Life Corp. today ranks as one of America’s leading financial and insurance operations, with over $96 billion in assets and over $5 billion in policyholder equity. It is a mutual insurance holding company, owned by its policyholders, which boasts over half of America’s 100 largest companies as its clients. In addition to insurance, it also sells mutual fund and annuity products. Its advertising icon, the humpback whale, is a well-known corporate symbol.

	History

	The company began operations in 1868 as the Pacific Life Insurance Co. It branched out into accident and disability insurance over the years before changing its corporate structure to a mutual insurance company in 1936. (Today, the life insurance company has reverted to stock structure, providing access to capital markets if needed, but the basic mutual structure remains in effect for policyholders, who own the holding company.) In the 1950s, the company was one of the first in America to begin computerizing its data-entry operations. In recent years, it launched a subsidiary, Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO), which has become one of the leading fixed-income management firms in the world. Included among its other subsidiaries are companies providing life reinsurance in Europe and Asia and a company specializing in leasing aircraft.

	Pacific Life Annuities

	Pacific Life annuities include both Fixed and Variable products. One of its two fixed annuities is a single-premium deferred annuity; the other is a flexible-premium annuity. Its seven different variable annuity products are all tailored to different stages in the retirement-planning process. The company also lists nine annuity products it characterizes as “inactive” – not currently offered for sale.

	Financial-strength ratings

	Pacific Life annuities are issued by Pacific Life Insurance Co., Pacific Life & Annuity Co. and Pacific Select Distributors, Inc. (a subsidiary of Pacific Life Insurance Co.; it issues the variable annuities). The most recent financial-strength ratings for the holding company, Pacific Life Corp., and Pacific Life Insurance Co. and Pacific Life & Annuity Co. are: A+ (2nd best) by A.M. Best; AA- (4th best) by Standard & Poor’s; Aa3 (4th best) by Moody’s; and AA- (4th best) by Fitch.


Don't Just Shop, Implement a Solid Retirement Strategy
Purchasing an annuity is a big decision. Online research is a good start, but prudent investors should discuss all their options and risks with an independent financial advisor. Request a free,
no-obligation consultation today, along with a report of current rates on brand-name annuities.

	Recent news

	The company’s ratings were downgraded in early 2009 by three of the four rating agencies. A.M. Best downgraded its financial-strength rating from A++ to A+ on 03/06/2009; Standard & Poor’s downgraded its financial-strength rating from AA to AA- on 02/26/2009; Fitch downgraded its financial-strength rating from AA to AA- on 02/26/2009. Moody’s left its financial-strength rating unchanged at Aa3 on 02/17/2009. All four agencies changed the company’s future outlook designation from “stable” to “negative.” The outlook designation expresses the agency’s opinion of the company’s financial performance in the near-future and the likelihood of future rating downgrades.

	The downgrades in financial strength and outlook reflected deteriorating conditions in the economy generally and the life-insurance industry in particular. (On the same day that Standard & Poor’s announced its rating downgrade for Pacific Life, it also announced downgrades for 10 other life-insurance groups.) The company’s variable-annuity product offerings made it vulnerable to the stock-market decline beginning in the fall of 2008. The rating agencies anticipated that the company’s fixed-income portfolios (which include commercial mortgages and mortgage-backed securities) would likely decline in value in the coming months.

Research No-Load Annuities Gain Momentum


    As more wirehouse registered reps join RIAs or start their own, as income tax rates rise, and as Baby Boomers continue their march into retirement, expect investments in no-load variable annuities to grow.  

Alan Lavine 1 | May 18, 2010


































As more wirehouse registered reps join RIAs or start their own, as income tax rates rise, and as Baby Boomers continue their march into retirement, expect investments in no-load variable annuities to grow.
Over the past five years ending in 2009, sales of no-load variable annuities totaled $16 billion, representing about 2.2 percent of total deferred variable annuity sales, according to Morningstar. Some believe that the amount invested in no-load variable annuities could double over the next five years. In fact, a number of insurance companies have lately been launching inexpensive no-load annuities targeted at the wave of registered reps becoming RIA adviser reps. Jefferson National rolled out its first flat-fee annuity in 2005. But over the last couple of years Fidelity, Ameritas Insurance, Pacific Life, MetLife, Prudential and Nationwide Financial have rolled out their own versions of this product, too. “Broker-dealers are demanding no-load variable annuities and insurance companies are meeting the demand,” says Tamiko Toland, editor of Annuity Insight. ” Insurers are aggressively pursuing the no-load market with new product designs.” Advisors now have 95 no-load or low-cost variable annuities to pick from, according to Morningstar. The average broker-sold variable annuity has back-end surrender charges and annual costs as high as 300 basis points, including fund management fees, mortality and expense charges and principal guarantees. Surrender periods can last up to seven years.
The no-load annuities, in contrast, are low cost and have simplified features and no surrender charges. Toland says the costs on these newer products, which include mortality and expenses charges, fund management fees and Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit fees, tend to run at about 200 basis points annually.
For example, Jefferson National’s “Monument Advisor,” is a commission-free and surrender fee-free variable annuity. The product has no death benefit guarantee and no living benefit guarantee. Instead, the insurer charges a flat $20 monthly fee, regardless of the annuity’s size. Jefferson National’s product provides over 250 investment options, including Rydex and Pro Funds, which offer alternative assets and bull and bear market funds. “Tactical asset allocation is playing a bigger role in asset management strategies,” says Jefferson National President Larry Greenberg. Since the no-load annuity was launched in 2006, $600 million has flowed into it. The average policyholder is in his or her 50s and invests $200,000. The cost on that $200,000 is just 12 basis points in insurance charges. Mutual fund management fees average about 50 basis points. “We stripped out the costs and pulled out the riders,” Greenberg said. “We streamlined the product as a tax-deferred investment. Our product provides four times the tax-deferral… (of a) typical variable annuity.” Fidelity Investments also offers a stripped down no-load product on its advisor platform. The Fidelity Personal Retirement Annuity, with $947 million in assets, charges just 35 basis points. Advisors have 50 funds to pick from with an average cost of about 50 basis points. The annuity does not offer death or living benefit guarantees. “We are seeing more interest in our annuity and I expect to see greater interest in the future,” says John Danahy, senior vice president at Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company, Boston. “The focus of advisors is around taxes because their high-net-worth clients are going through a period of tax increases.” Simplified products, he says, appeal to RIA adviser reps because they understand the impact of tax deferral, particularly on fixed income investments. Of course, the low-cost products of Jefferson National and Fidelity Investments aren’t for everyone. They are best suited for those who want to invest large sums, and are not concerned about a principal guarantee. But there also are no-load variable annuities that offer the popular Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits, for about an extra 100 basis points annually. Fund fees range from 30 basis points to about 100 basis points annually. As with the Jefferson and Fidelity products, there are no back-end surrender charges At Ameritas Life Insurance Co., Lincoln, NE, investment advisors deal directly with Ameritas or go through Pershing Securities, says Patricia Reiners, Ameritas assistant vice president. The insurer has $300 million in its two no-load variable annuity products for investment advisors. The “Ameritas Advisor No-Load Variable Annuity,” is a multi-manager annuity with funds by Vanguard, PIMCO, Fidelity and PRO Funds. The product comes with individual and spousal Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits for annual fees of 95 and 110 basis points, respectively. Mortality and expense charges are just 60 basis points and fund management fees range from about 30 to 100 basis points. Last November, Ameritas began offering the “Ameritas Advisor Select Variable Annuity,” which offers 22 Pro Funds mutual funds for active money managers who want to invest in alternative asset classes. “Investment advisors who favor tactical asset allocation use this annuity because the Pro Funds are designed for up and down markets.” Other no-load variable annuities, which may be available on broker-dealer platforms, include Pacific Life’s Pacific Odyssey variable annuity and Prudential’s Advisor Choice Variable Annuity. Nationwide Financial also has a no-load variable annuity available through Charles Schwab and Bank of America. If your clients want to deal directly with no-load investment companies, low-cost choices include Vanguard’s “Variable Annuity.” The product comes with a death benefit guarantee but no living benefit protection. Total costs run about 60 to 80 basis points annually, including its mutual funds. Last November, Fidelity teamed up with MetLife to offer “The MetLife Growth and Guaranteed Income” variable annuity. This no-load variable annuity is exclusively distributed by Fidelity. Total annual charges range from 190 to 205 basis points annually. As with anything, there is no free lunch with no-load variable annuities. “They turn capital gains and dividends into ordinary income,” warns Harold Evensky, a Coral Gables, Fla.-based RIA. Financial research by William Reichenstein, professor of investment management at Baylor University, shows that investment advisors can do just as well after taxes by using tax efficient strategies in taxable accounts. Nevertheless, a no-load variable annuity can be an attractive option for a client who needs to unload a high-cost broker-sold product, but still wants a lifetime withdrawal benefit. R.H. “Rick” Carey, president of RISE Enterprises, Inc., Roswell, GA- based consulting firm, recommends that advisors do a cost-benefit analysis before investing in even a low-cost variable annuity with a lifetime withdrawal benefit. “I don’t think there will be a stampede on the part of fee-only advisors to recommend even the lower cost (Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits),” he says. ”Pure income annuities will buy more income from fewer invested capital assets.”

          The initial customer ratings and reviews for this product (those dated before 3/18/2013) were provided to Fidelity through an email solicitation for feedback on the product. All ratings and reviews are provided to Fidelity on a voluntarily basis and are screened in accordance with the guidelines set forth in our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. For additional information on which ratings and reviews may be posted, please refer to our Customer Ratings and Review Terms of Use. Featured Reviews have been selected based on subjective criteria and reviewed by Fidelity Investments. The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of use and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted. Ratings and reviews are added continuously to the website (after a delay for screening against guidelines) and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed.


          The ratings and experience of customers may not be representative of the experiences of all customers or investors and is not indicative of future success. The accuracy of information included in the customer ratings and reviews cannot be guaranteed by Fidelity Investments. Customers who post ratings may be responsible for disclosing whether they have a financial interest or conflict in submitting a rating and review.
