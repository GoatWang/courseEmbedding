January 09, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK & TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Harmony Merger Corp. (NASDAQ:HRMN, HRMNU and HRMNW) (“Harmony”) and 
      privately-held MUNDOmedia (“Mundo”) today jointly announced that 
      they have entered into a plan of reorganization whereby Mundo will 
      become a publicly listed company through a combination with Harmony. The

      The New Mundo shares issued to the Mundo shareholders in the transaction 
      will be subject to lockup provisions identical to those applicable to 
      Harmony’s founders (12 months, with 50% subject to potential early 
      release). Following the transaction, the board of directors of New Mundo 
      will consist of seven members. Ross Levinsohn will remain Executive 
      Chairman of the company, four members will be nominated by Mundo’s 
      current shareholders and two will be nominated by Harmony.

      $5,000,001 upon closing of the transaction and certain other customary 
      closing conditions for transactions of this nature.
    

      Eric Rosenfeld, Chairman and CEO of Harmony, commented, “We are pleased 
      that Harmony’s Board of Directors, as well as our Special Advisor, Joel 
      Greenblatt, unanimously approved this transaction. We believe that Mundo 
      is without parallel in its sector, making it an extremely attractive 
      partner. Mundo has a very appealing growth profile and a compelling 
      valuation. We expect that its numerous competitive advantages will 
      enable the company to continue to prosper.”
    

      Joel Greenblatt, Harmony’s Special Advisor, said, “An attractive 
      valuation, an experienced management team and a global leader in its 
      sector are some of the attributes that make this a unique investment 
      opportunity. This is a quality company with significant growth prospects 
      and I am excited about its future.”
    

      Jason Theofilos, Mundo’s Founder and CEO, stated, “This transaction will 
      empower Mundo to accelerate its vision to become the global partner of 
      choice for tier one brands as we continue executing on our strategy 
      through impressive organic growth and acquisition expansion.”
    

      Ross Levinsohn, Mundo’s Executive Chairman, stated, “The growing 
      importance of precision marketing plays squarely in the favor of Mundo 
      Media’s business model. Every day the chorus grows louder from marketers 
      to substantiate value for every dollar spent – Mundo excels at 
      delivering results and quality experiences.”

      Graubard Miller and McCarthy Tetrault LLP and Mundo is being represented

About Harmony Merger Corp.


      Harmony was incorporated in Delaware on May 21, 2014 as a blank check 
      company whose objective is to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, 
      asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or 
      other similar business combination, one or more businesses or entities. 
      On March 27, 2015, Harmony consummated its initial public offering 
      (“IPO”) of 11,500,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of common 
      stock and one warrant to purchase one common share, generating gross 
      proceeds of $115,000,000 and net proceeds of $112,605,665 after 
      deducting $2,394,335 of transaction costs paid at closing (up to an 
      additional $4,325,000 of deferred underwriting expenses may be paid upon 
      the completion of a business combination). In addition, Harmony 
      generated gross and net proceeds of $5,585,000 from a private placement 
      (the “Private Placement”) of units (“Private Units”) to certain of the 
      initial stockholders of Harmony prior to the IPO and Cantor Fitzgerald & 
      Co., the representative of the underwriters in the IPO (“Cantor”). 
      Following the closing of the IPO and the Private Placement on March 27, 
      2015, an amount of $117,300,000 (or $10.20 per share sold to the public 
      in the Offering included in the Units (“Public Shares”)) from the sale 
      of the Units and Private Units was placed in a trust account (“Trust 
      Account”) and invested in U.S. treasuries or United States bonds having 
      a maturity of 180 days or less or money market funds meeting the 
      applicable conditions of Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment 
      Company Act of 1940, as amended. The $117,300,000 placed into the Trust 
      Account may not be released until the earlier of (i) the consummation of 
      Harmony’s initial business combination and (ii) Harmony’s failure to 
      consummate a business combination within the prescribed time. As of 
      December 31, 2016, Harmony held approximately $117.5 million in the 
      Trust Account.
    

      Harmony and its directors and executive officers, as well as Cantor, may 
      be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies for the 
      special meeting of Harmony stockholders to be held to approve the 
      business combination. Stockholders are advised to read, when available, 
      Harmony’s preliminary proxy statement/registration statement and 
      definitive proxy statement/registration statement in connection with the 
      solicitation of proxies for the special meeting because these statements 
      will contain important information. The definitive proxy 
      statement/registration statement will be mailed to stockholders as of a 
      record date to be established for voting on the business combination. 
      Stockholders will also be able to obtain a copy of the proxy 
      statement/registration statement, without charge, by directing a request 
      to: Harmony Merger Corp., 777 Third Avenue, 37th Floor, New 
      York, NY 10017. The preliminary proxy statement/registration statement 
      and definitive proxy statement/registration statement, once available, 
      can also be obtained, without charge, at the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission's internet site (http://www.sec.gov).

NEW YORK, March 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Harmony Merger Corp. ("Harmony") (NASDAQ:   HRMNU, HRMN, HRMNW), a public investment vehicle formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, acquisition or similar business combination, announced today that it has received stockholder approval to extend the date by which it must complete an initial business combination to July 27, 2017 (the "Extension").








Harmony obtained the Extension in order to allow more time to attempt to complete the previously announced proposed business combination with NextDecade LLC, the liquefied natural gas ("LNG") development company focused on LNG export projects and associated pipelines in the State of Texas.  While the Extension allows Harmony until July 27, 2017 to complete an initial business combination, Harmony has indicated that if it is unable to enter into a definitive agreement for an initial business combination by April 27, 2017, it will promptly file the necessary proxy materials with the SEC to seek shareholder approval to dissolve and liquidate or to have holders agree to a further extension of time to complete an initial business combination.
At the annual meeting held to approve the Extension, holders of 495,335 public shares exercised their right to convert their shares into a pro rata portion of the cash held in Harmony's trust account in connection with the Extension.  As previously announced, Harmony's stockholders prior to its initial public offering that participated in the simultaneous private placement of units (the "insiders") and NextDecade, LLC agreed that if the Extension was approved, they or their affiliates would contribute to Harmony as a loan (each loan being referred to herein as a "Contribution") $0.0275 for each public share that was not converted in connection with the stockholder vote to approve the Extension, for each month (or a pro rata portion thereof if less than a month), that is needed by Harmony to complete an initial business combination from March 27, 2017 until July 27, 2017. Accordingly, the insiders and NextDecade will be depositing an aggregate of $302,628 to Harmony's trust account for the first month of the extension.  As a result, a total of approximately $112.8 million now remains in Harmony's trust account (or $10.25 per share that was not converted into a pro rata portion of the trust account).
About Harmony Merger Corp. 
Harmony (NASDAQ:    HRMN) was incorporated in Delaware on May 21, 2014 as a blank check company whose objective is to acquire, through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more businesses or entities. On March 27, 2015, Harmony consummated its initial public offering ("IPO") of 11,500,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one common share, and a simultaneous private placement of units to certain initial stockholders and Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., the representative of the underwriters in the IPO.

Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements made herein are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the "safe harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as "anticipate", "believe", "expect", "estimate", "plan", "outlook", and "project" and other similar expressions that predict or indicate future events or trends or that are not statements of historical matters. Such forward-looking statements include timing of the proposed business combination with NextDecade; the business plans, objectives, expectations and intentions of the parties once the transaction is complete, and Harmony's estimated and future results of operations, business strategies, competitive position, industry environment and potential growth opportunities. These forward-looking statements reflect the current analysis of existing information and are subject to various risks and uncertainties. As a result, caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Due to known and unknown risks, our actual results may differ materially from our expectations or projections.
The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in these forward-looking statements: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the terms of the previously announced letter of intent ("LOI") not hereafter being memorialized in a definitive agreement; the outcome of any legal proceedings that have been, or will be, instituted against Harmony or other parties to the LOI following announcement of the LOI and transactions contemplated therein; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by the LOI due to the failure to obtain approval of the stockholders of Harmony or other conditions to closing in the LOI; and other risks and uncertainties described herein, as well as those risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in other reports and other public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") by Harmony. 
Additional information concerning these and other factors that may impact our expectations and projections can be found in Harmony's periodic filings with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and in the proxy statement to be filed by Harmony regarding the transaction memorialized in the LOI with the SEC when available. Harmony's SEC filings are available publicly on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Harmony disclaims any obligation to update the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
Disclaimer
This communication shall neither constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. 
Additional Information about the Transaction and Where to Find It 
In connection with the proposed business combination, Harmony will file a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and will mail a definitive proxy statement and other relevant documents to its stockholders. Investors and security holders of Harmony are advised to read, when available, the preliminary proxy statement, and amendments thereto, and the definitive proxy statement in connection with Harmony's solicitation of proxies for its stockholders' meeting to be held to approve the business combination because the proxy statement will contain important information about the transaction and the parties thereto. The definitive proxy statement will be mailed to stockholders of Harmony as of a record date to be established for voting on the transaction. Stockholders will also be able to obtain copies of the proxy statement, without charge, once available, at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov or by directing a request to: Harmony Merger Corp., 777 Third Avenue, 37th Floor, New York, New York 10017.
Participants in Solicitation
Harmony and its directors, executive officers and other members of their management and employees, under SEC rules, may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of Harmony stockholders in connection with the proposed business combination. Information regarding the persons who may, under SEC rules, be deemed participants in the solicitation of proxies to Harmony's stockholders in connection with the proposed transaction will be set forth in the proxy statement for the proposed transaction when available. Information concerning the interests of Harmony's participants in the solicitation, which may, in some cases, be different than those of Harmony's and the target company's stockholders generally, will be set forth in the proxy statement relating to the business combination when it becomes available.

Harmony Merger Corp. Announces Filing Of Proxy Supplement






Business Wire




Mar 20, 2017 11:36 AM EDT













 


















































  Harmony Merger Corp. ("Harmony") (NASDAQ: HRMNU, HRMN, HRMNW), a public investment vehicle formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, acquisition or similar business combination, announced today that it has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a supplement to its definitive proxy statement, dated March 13, 2017 (the "Proxy Supplement") relating to its annual meeting of stockholders.  At the annual meeting, Harmony's stockholders will be asked to consider and vote upon, among other things, a proposal to amend (the "Extension Amendment") Harmony's amended and restated certificate of incorporation to extend the date by which Harmony has to consummate an initial business combination (the "Extension") to July 27, 2017 (the "Extended Date").  The Proxy Supplement indicated that Harmony's stockholders prior to its initial public offering that participated in the simultaneous private placement of units (the "insiders") and NextDecade, LLC ("NextDecade"), the liquefied natural gas ("LNG") development company focused on LNG export projects and associated pipelines in the State of Texas that has executed a previously announced non-binding letter of intent with the Company for a proposed business combination, have agreed that if the Extension Amendment is approved, they or their affiliates will contribute to Harmony as a loan (each loan being referred to herein as a "Contribution") $0.0275 for each public share that is not converted in connection with the stockholder vote to approve the Extension, for each month (or a pro rata portion thereof if less than a month), that is needed by Harmony to complete an initial business combination from March 27, 2017 until the Extended Date. Accordingly, if Harmony takes until the Extended Date to complete an initial business combination, which would represent four months through the Extended Date, the insiders and NextDecade would make aggregate Contributions of approximately $1,265,000 (assuming no public shares were converted). Accordingly, if the Extension Amendment is approved and the Extension is completed and Harmony takes the full time through the Extended Date to complete an initial business combination, the conversion amount per share at the meeting for such business combination or Harmony's subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.32 per share, in comparison to the current conversion amount of approximately $10.21 per share. The insiders and NextDecade will not make any Contribution unless the Extension Amendment is approved and the Extension is completed.
