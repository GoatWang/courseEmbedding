What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

INVESTMENT PROCESS – Mittleman Brothers, LLC
































 






























INVESTMENT PROCESS 






Our investment process begins with “Idea Generation.” We seek to identify quality businesses that generate strong free cash flow, have high barriers to entry and exhibit durable economic advantages. We are most attracted to companies that are led by strong management teams with a proven track record of success, who have a significant personal financial stake in the company. There is no one source for our investment ideas; they can come from our network of professional contacts, industry conferences, SEC filings, quarterly conference calls/transcripts, sell-side research reports, our existing holdings’ customers, competitors or suppliers, and/or a myriad of industry publications.
Critical to our investment discipline is to initiate positions only when we deem a prospective security to be severely undervalued. Naturally, the next step in our process is our proprietary “Fair Value Appraisal.” In order to establish a conservative estimate of fair value, we conduct an analysis of a company’s historical performance, an estimate of discounted cash flow, comparable company trading multiples and comparable company private market transaction multiples. We employ a private equity mentality towards public equity investing and therefore analyze each stock as if we are buying the entire company, focusing on the cash-on-cash return of the investment. We also evaluate sales, EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) and free cash flow production over an extended time frame, avoiding an over-reliance on any one particularly good or bad year. When warranted, we will assess the value of a company’s other assets, such as excess real estate, net operating losses, or liabilities such as an underfunded pension plan.
The next step of the process is “Investment Execution.” We remain patient and disciplined in our initial acquisition of a company’s shares and invest incrementally. Position sizes are determined by estimated total return potential, perceived risk/reward ratio, and liquidity. We typically ease into positions on negative pulses and ease out of positions into strength.
The final and ongoing step of the investment process is “Portfolio Management.” We manage a concentrated portfolio of 10 to 20 positions and continuously re-evaluate our assumptions to maintain what we believe to be appropriate position sizes. We monitor quarterly conference calls and other presentations made by the companies we hold, as well as their competitors. Positions are sold for three primary reasons: if a security approaches or exceeds estimated fair value, if a superior investment opportunity emerges, or if our fundamental investment thesis proves invalid.

INVESTMENT DISCIPLINE – Mittleman Brothers, LLC
































 






























INVESTMENT DISCIPLINE 






Mittleman Investment Management, LLC (“MIM”) is an SEC-registered investment advisor that provides discretionary portfolio management to individuals and institutions. We pursue superior returns through long-term investments in what we deem to be severely undervalued securities, while maintaining our focus on limiting risk. We define investment risk as the probability of long-term loss of capital. We believe that we mitigate risk by investing in businesses that are proven franchises with durable economic advantages, evidenced by a well-established track record of substantial free cash flow generation over complete business cycles, and only when the very low valuation at which the investment is made provides us with a significant margin of safety. We employ a concentrated, long-term approach, usually holding between 10 and 20 positions, for about three years on average. Annual portfolio turnover is typically 30% to 40%.
MIM invests globally, with foreign holdings representing 30% of our portfolios on average. Although we have no intentional focus on any particular size of company, nor do we operate with any restrictions in this regard, the average market capitalization of our holdings has historically been small simply because that is where we’ve usually found the greatest disparities between market price and fair value. We do buy stock in large capitalization companies as well, when they are priced attractively enough to warrant inclusion in our portfolios. Our ability to go wherever the best risk/reward ratios appear to be available, in companies small and large, domestic and international, gives us an advantage over other investment managers who operate within a more constrained investment universe.
We seek to invest when the security of a favored company is available for purchase at an extreme discount to our conservative appraisal of its fair value. Our process of security selection is research intensive, and we rely on our own analysis to make buy/sell decisions and fair value determinations. We invest primarily in common stocks of both domestically and internationally domiciled companies, of any size or market capitalization. Exchange-listed shares as well as unlisted over-the-counter securities are considered. We may also invest in debt or hybrid securities or other financial instruments which, in our opinion, present special opportunities, including securities of distressed companies and companies already operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
An important consideration in our investment process is whether or not management has a meaningful amount of their net worth invested in the stock of the company they manage. The partners of Mittleman Brothers, LLC have made substantial investments in the same stocks in which we’ve invested for our clients’ accounts, and we like to see that the management teams of our portfolio holdings are willing to eat their own cooking as well.
After identifying situations that meet our investment criteria, we wait patiently for shares of a chosen company to trade at what we perceive to be an extremely low valuation before making purchases. This aspect of our investment discipline is best described by a quote attributed to Joe Rosenberg (successful value-oriented investment manager for the Tisch family’s Loews Corp.) in Barron’s magazine in the early 1990s: “Have opinions at extremes, and wait for extreme moments.”
We believe that the difference between mediocre investment returns and above-average results is the adherence to a proven investment discipline. And the difference between above-average results and outstanding investment returns stems mainly from the degree of selectivity and patience employed in the application of that discipline. That patience being most critical during the humbling down cycles, like the particularly brutal one we endured most recently from May 2007 until March 2009. The key rules are don’t swing the bat unless it’s a slow pitch right down the middle of the plate, and don’t be bullied by the market into doing something irrational, whether buying or selling. This may sound obvious or clichéd to some, and perhaps confusingly ironic to others, but the ability to sit and do nothing may be the most rare and valuable investing skill of all. Inevitably, extreme price dislocations occur that create real opportunities for action, and only the patient and prepared investor can recognize such ideal situations and take full advantage. We work relentlessly to do just that.
Like-minded investors are welcome to join us.

PERFORMANCE 






MITTLEMAN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, LLC (MIM)
ANNUALIZED PERFORMANCE (As of 03/31/17)

CUMULATIVE PERFORMANCE (12/31/02 through 03/31/17)

PERFORMANCE BY YEAR


NOTES TO PERFORMANCE: Mittleman Investment Management, LLC (“MIM”) claims compliance with the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS®). MIM is an SEC-registered investment advisor.  The composite includes all fully discretionary separately managed accounts which follow the firm’s investment strategy, including those accounts no longer with the firm. MIM’s value-oriented strategy is to invest in a concentrated portfolio of primarily common stocks, unrestricted as to market capitalization, of both domestic and international companies. The U.S. Dollar is the currency used to express performance. Performance presented prior to January 2006 occurred while the Portfolio Manager was affiliated with a prior firm and the Portfolio Manager was the only individual responsible for selecting the securities to buy and sell. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Margin is not an active part of the management of the accounts but may be used on an opportunistic basis if permitted by the client. Investments made by MIM for its clients differ significantly in comparison to the referenced indexes in terms of security holdings, industry weightings, and asset allocations. Accordingly, investment results and volatility will differ from those of the benchmarks.
For more information or for a copy of the firm’s fully compliant presentation and the firm’s list of composite descriptions, please contact us at (516) 686-6200.

Phil Mittleman, Chief Executive Officer & President, commented, "We couldn't be happier to have Steve join our team.  We have known and admired him for several years and he brings to us over three decades of invaluable experience within operations, compliance and finance." 
Mr. Bondi stated, "I've long respected Mittleman Brothers and am looking forward to working with the team as they continue to grow their investment management business around a value-based approach that has generated strong returns for a long-term oriented client base."

And Varun has progressively become a more integral part of our organization. We are delighted to formalize this and reward both of them for their tireless dedication to the firm."

NEW YORK, June 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mittleman Brothers, LLC, one of the largest shareholders of Carmike Cinemas Inc. (NASDAQ:   CKEC), which currently controls approximately 2.33 million CKEC shares, 9.6% of the total shares outstanding, expressed its disappointment with the decision to delay the Special Meeting of shareholders (the "Meeting") which had been scheduled for today, June 30th, 2016.








Presumably, given this decision to delay the vote, Carmike's Board has been unable to gather enough votes to adjourn the Meeting via ballots, a far less onerous voting threshold to achieve than required for approval of the merger itself.  We believe this action is implicit confirmation that Carmike's shareholders overwhelmingly oppose AMC Entertainment's ("AMC") $30 per share cash take-over offer. 
Carmike's shareholders have had more than enough time to consider AMC's offer, with 88 days having passed since the deal was first announced on March 3, 2016.  Carmike's Board took only 57 days to negotiate and approve this low-ball offer from the first phone call from AMC's new CEO to Carmike's CEO on January 7, 2016, to the signing and announcement date on March 3rd.  But now, clearly lacking votes to approve and cement this blatant undervaluation of Carmike's shares, AMC and Carmike's Board are choosing to draw out the process rather than allowing the vote to occur on schedule and properly heeding the will of the company's shareholders to terminate this fatally flawed transaction.  Furthermore, that Carmike's Board, beyond their obligations in the merger agreement, yesterday amended their By-Laws to potentially permit further delays is unconscionable.  
Carmike's shareholders clearly recognize that selling the best performing major movie theater chain in North America over the past seven years, for less than 8x EBITDA, makes no sense whatsoever as its lesser-performing peers trade in excess of 8x EBITDA in the open market today, with no control premium.  
Despite AMC's laughable assertions to the contrary, even a $40 per share valuation of CKEC, in any combination of cash and/or AMC stock, would still be immensely accretive to AMC's intrinsic value per share, and for AMC to imply otherwise, is a misleading statement.  At $40 per share, even if Screenvision is valued at $0, AMC would be paying an enterprise value of 7.9x CKEC's synergy-adjusted EBITDA of $170M (2015's adj. EBITDA of $135M + $35M in projected cost synergies), that is less than the cost of AMC buying back their own stock in the open market today, and does not include the massive windfall benefit AMC would receive in additional founders' shares of National CineMedia, Inc. estimated to be worth about $260M, which pays hearty dividends to offset much of the likely associated make-whole payments.  So let us repeat this easily discernible truth:  even at $40 per share, the acquisition of CKEC by AMC would be immensely accretive to AMC's intrinsic value per share.
Mittleman Brothers again encourages all Carmike Cinemas' shareholders to review our most recently filed presentation highlighting the gross deficiencies in both process and price reflected in Carmike's proposed sale to AMC.  As we point out in the presentation http://www.mittlemanbrothers.com/ckecamc-opposition, CKEC has out-performed its peer group over the past seven years under current management, in sales, EBITDA, attendance, and concessions growth, and yet merely valuing CKEC at the mean EV/EBITDA trading multiple of the peer group yields a stock price in excess of $40, without even considering a control premium, or the immense synergy value that AMC would solely retain in this unusually rare consolidation opportunity pairing the second and fourth largest movie theaters chains in the U.S. 
Mittleman Brothers again urges all Carmike Cinemas shareholders to vote "AGAINST" this terribly unfair merger proposal before Carmike's postponed Special Meeting on July 15th.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
