 The Definitions of "Upstream" and "Downstream" in the Production Process | Chron.com              Skip to main content.  The Definitions of "Upstream" and "Downstream" in the Production Process  by Brian Bass        Commercial shipping or receiving of goods globally involves international logistics. Ryan McVay/Photodisc/Getty Images   Related Articles  1 Push vs. Pull Supply Chain Strategy 2 Upstream and Downstream Activities for a Marketing Director 3 What Are the Four Elements of Supply Chain Management? 4 Difference Between Tier 1 & Tier 2 Companies    "Upstream" and "downstream" are business terms applicable to the production processes that exist within several industries. Industries that commonly use this terminology include the metals industry, oil, gas, biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Upstream, downstream and midstream make up the stages of the production process for these and other industries.        Definition of Upstream The upstream stage of the production process involves searching for and extracting raw materials. The upstream part of the production process does not do anything with the material itself, such as processing the material. This part of the process simply finds and extracts the raw material. Thus, any industry that relies on the extraction of raw materials commonly has an upstream stage in its production process. In a more general sense, "upstream" can also refer to any part of the production process relating to the extraction stages. Examples of Upstream Processes In the petroleum industry, locating underground or underwater oil reserves characterizes the upstream process. Additionally, the upstream process in this industry involves bringing oil and gas to the surface. Extraction wells represent an example of a structure operating in this stage in the process. The upstream stage in the production process may also manifest itself as a supplier providing raw materials to manufacturers or other businesses that ultimately process the materials. Definition of Downstream The downstream stage in the production process involves processing the materials collected during the upstream stage into a finished product. The downstream stage further includes the actual sale of that product to other businesses, governments or private individuals. The type of end user will vary depending on the finished product. Regardless of the industry involved, the downstream process has direct contact with customers through the finished product. Examples of Downstream Processes In the oil and gas industry, the downstream process consists of converting crude oil into other products and then selling those products to customers. Thus, oil refineries represent structures that operate within the downstream process. However, any kind of plant that processes raw materials may qualify as operating within the downstream stage of production. A company that combines both upstream and downstream processes is an integrated company.
