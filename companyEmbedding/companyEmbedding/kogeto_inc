(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information  This section and other parts of this Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Forward-looking statements also can be identified by words such as "future," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "intends," "will," "would," "could," "can," "may," and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company's actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-Q and those discussed in Item 2.01 of the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K/A (Amendment No. 2) filed June 20, 2014 under the heading of "Risk Factors" which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 filed May 27, 2014 and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q.  The safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 excludes issuers of "penny stock" (as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our common stock currently falls within that definition. All forward-looking statements in this document are based on information currently available to us as of the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws.  Nature of Business  We provide integrated hardware, software and web services to deliver 360degree panoramic video to consumers and businesses. Our products are the consumer-grade Dot(R) and the professional-grade LucyTM. Dot(R) is a 360degree panoramic video lens which attaches to Apple's iPhone 4, 4S and 5 via a proprietary bracket. LucyTM is our professional-grade 360degree panoramic video camera. In addition, we provide professional video production services for 360degree panoramic video. Our next generation professional-grade 360degree panoramic video camera JoeyTM is currently being developed and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2014.  Business Strategy  We are committed to bringing the best 360degree panoramic video experience to our customers through innovative hardware, software and services. Our business strategy leverages our ability to design and develop our hardware, application software, and services utilizing outside consultants to cut costs and improve efficiency to provide our customers new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamless integration, and innovative design. The Company believes continual investment in research and development and marketing is critical to the development and sale of innovative products and technologies.  From a product development standpoint, we are focusing our efforts on releasing our new lower-cost next generation professional-grade 360degree panoramic video camera Joey this summer. In addition, we will begin developing an enhanced version of Dot in conjunction with the refinement and realignment with other phone models at the end of this year.  Our strategy is focused on launching Joey this summer, renewing and establishing new distribution partners to the education market and new vertical markets including security, robotics, military, small to medium sized conferencing and embedded systems. To date, we have sold our Lucy products as our professional-grade video cameras primarily to the education market. We have not manufactured any additional Lucy products after the first quarter of 2014, as Joey will replace our Lucy products.  In addition, we expect to launch a Kickstarter campaign in the third quarter of 2014 for presales of Joey with revenue for these presales expected to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014 upon the shipment to the buyers.  In connection with our Dot product, we expect to sell Dot in conjunction with the release and marketing efforts associated with the launch of Joey. Upon the successful launch of Joey, we will begin to develop an enhanced version of Dot at the end of this year for sale in 2015. We plan to renew and establish new retail partners as the outlet for Dot sales in 2015.  We have also begun to redesign our corporate website to accentuate both our professional cameras and services and our consumer offerings.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2014 Compared to the Three Months Ended June 30, 2013  Net Sales  Net sales are comprised of revenue received from the sales of our products and professional video production services net of returns, refunds, discounts and price protection rebates.  For the three months ended June 30, 2014, net sales decreased $40,126 (or 85%) to $7,273 compared to net sales for the three months ended June 30, 2013 of $47,398. The decrease in net sales was a result of significant reductions in sales of our Dot product primarily due to our inability to complete the next generation of our product lines as a result of a lack of financing.  Specifically, sales of our Dot product decreased from $31,276 to $2,189 (or from 1,216 units to 52 units) during the comparable three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, a decrease of $29,087 or 93%. Our decrease in sales of our Dot product was due to inadequate funds required to develop an enhanced version with an improved optic, as we believe the market required a release of an improved product in order to maintain or increase sales levels. Sales of our Lucy product decreased from $12,580 to $0 (or from 4 units to 0 units) during the comparable three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. We did not sell any Lucy products in the three months ended June 30, 2014 and have only 5 Lucy units in inventory as of June 30, 2014. We have not manufactured any additional Lucy products after the first quarter of 2014, as Joey will replace our Lucy products.  Cost of Sales  Cost of sales includes all of the manufacturing and materials costs of our Dot and Lucy products, plus merchant fees and fulfillment costs excluding freight and costs related to our professional video production services.  Cost of sales for the three months ended June 30, 2014 was $4,034, a decrease of $31,689 (or 89%) from $35,723 for the three months ended June 30, 2013, primarily due to the reduction of net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2014.  Gross Profit  Gross profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales) was $11,675 for the three months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to a gross profit of $3,238 in the three months ended June 30, 2014. The gross profit decreased primarily due to the reduction of net sales in the three months ended June 30, 2014.  Production and Operations Expense  Production and operations expense is primarily comprised of payroll costs associated with coordinating production-related activities (ordering, logistics, quality assurance, etc.) for our Lucy and Dot products, including overseeing and managing relationships with third party manufacturers whose costs are included in cost of sales.  Production and operations expenses decreased $31,964 (or 100%) from $31,964 for the three months ended June 30, 2013 to $0 for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in production and operations expenses was primarily due to the termination of the employee in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to the reduction in overall costs related to the reduced manufacturing activity, as production of our Dot product was on hold waiting for new versions of the product and production of our Lucy product was at a lower volume due to the lack of financing.  Selling and Marketing Expense  Selling and marketing expense is comprised of payroll costs, commissions, freight and general marketing, promotion, advertising expense and public relations costs.  Selling and marketing expense decreased $38,792 (or 94%) to $2,645 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 from $41,437 in the same period in 2013, as we reduced marketing efforts substantially while we sought additional investor funding and have focused our efforts on development of our next generation products.  Research and Development Expense  Research and development expense is comprised of payroll costs and outside vendor costs for developing new technology (including software, unless considered for capitalization) associated with developing new versions of our products and associated operating software.  For the three months ended June 30, 2014, research and development expense increased $55,087 (or 213%) to $80,962 from $25,875 in 2013, as we increased research and development expenses on the development of software and hardware for our new lower-cost next generation professional-grade 360degree panoramic video camera Joey for release this summer.  General and Administrative Expense  General and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of payroll costs, travel and entertainment, insurance, rent, office expenses, legal fees and accounting fees.  For the three months ended June 30, 2014, general and administrative expense increased $20,903 (or 12%) to $195,991 from $175,088 in 2013, as general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the increase in legal fees in the three months ended June 30, 2014 related to the Merger and the SEC reporting requirements.  Stock-Based Compensation  Stock-based compensation is comprised of the expense associated with the value of share-based payments to employees, selected contractors and board members.  For the three months ended June 30, 2014, stock-based compensation decreased $33,495 to $0 from $33,495 in the same period in 2013 as pursuant to the Merger agreement, all granted and outstanding options of Old Kogeto were cancelled.  Financial Advisory Fees  Financial advisory fees is comprised of the expense associated with business and financial consulting services including the value of the warrants associated with the derivative liability but does not include the expense for professional fees or a chief financial officer which are included in general and administrative expense.  Financial advisory fees were $20,500 for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and $35,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2013. The financial advisory fees in 2014 are related to the expense associated with the agreement with Baytree for financial advisory services and the financial advisory fees in 2013 were for consulting related to the Secured 10% Bridge Notes  Depreciation and Amortization Expense  Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of production and office equipment, as well as amortization of any capitalized software.  For the three months ended June 30, 2014, depreciation and amortization expense was $2,934 as compared to $3,135 for the three months ended June 30, 2013, as depreciation and amortization expense remained relatively the same.  Interest Expense  For the three months ended June 30, 2014, interest expense decreased $13,301 to $9,035 from $22,336 during the same period in 2013 primarily due to the Senior Secured 10% Convertible Notes being repaid.  Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2014 Compared to the Six Months Ended June 30, 2013  Net Sales  Net sales are comprised of revenue received from the sales of our products and services net of returns, refunds, discounts and price protection rebates.  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, net sales decreased $103,081 (or 27%) to $273,527 compared to net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2013 of $376,608. The decrease in net sales was a result of significant reductions in sales of our Dot product primarily due to our inability to complete the next generation of our product lines as a result of a lack of financing.  Specifically, sales of our Dot product decreased from $170,864 to $12,386 (or from 7,066 units to 411 units) during the comparable six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, a decrease of $158,478 or 93%. Our decrease in sales of our Dot product was due to inadequate funds required to develop an enhanced version with an improved optic, as we believe the market required a release of an improved product in order to maintain or increase sales levels. Sales of our Lucy product increased from $235,830 to $242,698 (or from 55 units to 60 units) during the comparable six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, an increase of $6,868. Sales of our Lucy product remained relatively the same during the six months ended June 30, 2014 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2013 due to the financing in connection with the Merger to finance production of product to fill an outstanding order of the Lucy product in the first quarter of 2014.  Cost of Sales  Cost of sales includes all of the manufacturing and materials costs of our Dot and Lucy products, plus merchant fees and fulfillment costs excluding freight and costs related to our professional video production services.  Cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $321,085, a decrease of $23,465 (or 7%) from $344,550 for the six months ended June 30, 2013, primarily due to an allowance for obsolete inventory of $60,000 recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2014.  Gross Profit  Gross profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales) was $32,058 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to a gross loss of $47,558 in the six months ended June 30, 2014. The gross margin for both the Lucy and Dot products were minimal before taking into account the allowance for obsolete inventory of $60,000, which is primarily due to the sales discounts given.  Production and Operations Expense  Production and operations expense is primarily comprised of payroll costs associated with coordinating production-related activities (ordering, logistics, quality assurance, etc.) for our Lucy and Dot products, including overseeing and managing relationships with third party manufacturers whose costs are included in cost of sales.  Production and operations expenses decreased $64,973 (or 100%) from $64,973 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 to $0 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in production and operations expenses was primarily due to the termination of the employee in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to the reduction in overall costs related to the reduced manufacturing activity, as production of our Dot product was on hold waiting for new versions of the product and production of our Lucy product was at a lower volume due to the lack of financing.  Selling and Marketing Expense  Selling and marketing expense is comprised of payroll costs, commissions, freight and general marketing, promotion, advertising expense and public relations costs.  Selling and marketing expense decreased $84,529 (or 91%) to $7,969 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 from $92,498 in the same period in 2013, as we reduced marketing efforts substantially while we sought additional investor funding and have focused our efforts on development of our next generation products.  Research and Development Expense  Research and development expense is comprised of payroll costs and outside vendor costs for developing new technology (including software, unless considered for capitalization) associated with developing new versions of our products and associated operating software.  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, research and development expense increased $59,755 (or 123%) to $108,514 from $48,759 in 2013, as we increased research and development expenses on the development of software and hardware for our new lower-cost next generation professional-grade 360degree panoramic video camera Joey for release this summer.  General and Administrative Expense  General and administrative expenses are primarily comprised of payroll costs, travel and entertainment, insurance, rent, office expenses, legal fees and accounting fees.  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, general and administrative expense decreased $70,633 (or 18%) to $323,345 from $393,978 in 2013, as general and administrative expenses were reduced due to the reduction of an administrative employee, the decrease in accounting consulting fees and the decrease in health insurance and office expenses with the decrease in overall headcount offset by the increase in legal fees related to the Merger and the SEC reporting requirements.  Stock-Based Compensation  Stock-based compensation is comprised of the expense associated with the value of share-based payments to employees, selected contractors and board members.  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, stock-based compensation increased $181,449 to $248,439 from $66,990 in the same period in 2013 as holders of stock options received shares of our common stock in the Merger valued at a net value of $167,385, which was included in stock-based compensation for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Also, previous holders of stock options received shares of our common stock in the Merger valued at $81,054, which was included in stock-based compensation for the six months ended June 30, 2014.  Financial Advisory Fees  Financial advisory fees is comprised of the expense associated with business and financial consulting services including the value of the warrants associated with the derivative liability but does not include the expense for professional fees or a chief financial officer which are included in general and administrative expense.  Financial advisory fees were $882,976 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 and $35,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily related to the expense associated with the agreement with Baytree for financial advisory services in 2014.  Depreciation and Amortization Expense  Depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of production and office equipment, as well as amortization of any capitalized software.  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, depreciation and amortization expense was $6,141 as compared to $6,180 for the six months ended June 30, 2013, as depreciation and amortization expense remained relatively the same.  Other (Income) Expense  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, other income increased $6,592 to $7,695 from other income of $1,103 for the six months ended June 30, 2013 primarily for the reversal of some old vendor invoices.  Interest Expense  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, interest expense increased $143,777 to $184,231 from $40,454 during the same period in 2013 as we issued warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of our common stock valued at $90,000 and 258,927 shares of our common stock for foregone warrants valued at $72,615 to Senior Secured 10% Convertible Note holders upon the conversion of the notes and as part of the Merger, which was included in interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2014.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of June 30, 2014, the consolidated balance sheets reflected a cash balance of $777,647, negative working capital of $68,745 excluding the derivative liability of $705,500, and an accumulated deficit of $6,969,904. Management believes that it does not currently have sufficient cash to execute its operating plan but believes that we will be successful in obtaining sufficient financing to execute its operating plan. However, no assurance can be provided that we will secure additional financing or be able to achieve and sustain a profitable level of operations. To the extent that we are unsuccessful in our plan, management may find it necessary to contemplate the sale of assets and/or curtail operations.  At June 30, 2014, we had outstanding loans in the amount of approximately $350,000. The Bridge Notes totaling $300,000 are secured by security interests in substantially all of our assets. On July 3, 2014, we repaid $150,000 of principal value of the outstanding $300,000 of Bridge Notes.  Net cash used in operating activities  Net cash used in operating activities was approximately $696,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2014, compared to approximately $464,000 for the same period in 2013. The $232,000 increase was primarily due to the reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses upon receiving the cash from the advance related to the Merger.  Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities  Net cash provided by investing activities amounted to $89,797 for the six months ended June 30, 2014, compared to net cash used in investing activities of approximately $35,750 for six months ended June 30, 2013. The increase of $125,547 in cash provided was primarily a result of a decrease in restricted cash of $126,075.  Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities  Net cash provided by financing activities was $536,220 for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $564,687 for the six months ended June 30, 2013. The net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2014 included the net proceeds from the private placement of $684,220 offset by the repayment of short term debt - related parties of $123,000 and the repayment of Senior Secured 10% Convertible Notes of $25,000. The cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2013 includes the proceeds of $388,687 from the issuance of Secured 10% Bridge Notes and the proceeds of $200,000 from the issuance of Senior Secured 10% Convertible Notes offset by the repayment of short term debt  Going Concern Uncertainty  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred recurring losses, has negative working capital, has an accumulated deficit, and has experienced recurring negative cash flows from operations. This raises doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not engage in any activities involving variable interest entities or off-balance sheet arrangements.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  There are several new accounting pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") which are not yet effective. Management does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements will be applicable and therefore will not have a material impact on our financial position or operating results.
