In 1986 entrepreneur Joseph Segel launched the revolutionary retail service QVC, Inc. The West Chester, Pennsylvania based company--which stands for quality, value and convenience--has since become one of the largest retailers in the world. This particular home shopping network broadcasts 24 hours a day, 364 days a year, is seen in 195 million homes worldwide and is a $8.5 billion-a-year business.For entrepreneurs, small business owners and inventors, QVC presents an incredible opportunity to gain worldwide exposure--and make a hefty profit. I've had it my personal goal to get on QVC, though I've helped several entrepreneurs get on there. The thing is, the odds of actually making it front of a camera are against you. Every week QVC showcases over 1,150 products, 288 of which are new to customers. SoThat's not saying that you can't make your way to QVC. It means that you have to have the right product, the right personality and the following tips to accomplish this goal in the coming 2015 year:Do Your ResearchYou probably already have a product that's all ready to make it's way into people's homes. If you haven't gotten that far yet, you may have to wait a bit longer--which I'll get to shortly. However, if you haven't done your research, then you need to get to work on understanding your market--who your customers are, and what your customers are looking for, etc.Even when you have this information, as with any business, you must do a bit more homework--spend time actually watching QVC. Ask friends and family who watch QVC what they watch for. By doing these two actions, you can get a better idea about which products seem appealing on QVC and how your competition is presenting these products on television.Become aware of which products are not allowed on QVC, which includes products like firearms, fuel additives, genuine fur, or anything related to gambling and tobacco.Make Sure You Can Handle ProductionAccording to the QVC Vending Portal, "the item you submit for a product evaluation should be a manufactured item or, at the very least, a working prototype." This means that prior to submitting an application, you need to arrange for manufacturing. QVC wants to make sure that you are able to manufacture your item in mass quantities for order fulfillment. You do not have to have these quantities produced before the application process. Also, keep in mind that QVC will not pay for the manufacturing process, even if your product has been accepted.If you need a little more assistance in this area, then check out what well known author, (The 4 Hour Workweek), entrepreneur and investor Tim Ferriss suggests. For example, Ferriss recommends finding your manufacturer at trade shows or on sites like Alibaba, and ThomasNet (Thomas' Register of Manufacturers.) As for prototypes, he also suggests that you use 3D printers and only create small batches.Once you have the manufacturing  company committed, you need to calculate the whole cost of goods. This includes manufacturing and the shipping and packing costs involved. (What does the box cost?  Packing peanuts? Are you adding a personal note with the shipping? Who will take care of this leg of the shipping journey? Are you drop shipping?)Follow QVC's Submission CriteriaPrior to the submission your product--which should also be patented, you'll need to make sure that you review QVC's criteria. The network is looking for products that will achieve the following:Solve a real problemBe highly demonstrableAppeal to the massesIdeally have a finished sampleHave images or videoIt's also suggested that your product should be unique--meaning it's not available in too many other locations--made from quality materials and have a "wow factor." Finally, as Teddy Marcus, owner of the company Arcs & Angles, informed Crain's New York, "You have to be a talented salesperson, first to sell to QVC and then to impress its viewers." In other words, just because you want your face on T.V. doesn't meant you should be the one doing the ad. You may not be the best "face" for your product.Connect with a Brand Strategist/BrokerSometimes it takes more than a great product to get you onto the network. Why? Because there's a lot of competition out there, as previously mentioned. That's why it's important to use as many resources as possible. For example, inventor Lisa Ascolese was  introduced to a company executive who had a relationship with QVC through a friend--which was able to get her into a meeting with QVC executives.We may not be as fortunate as Ascolese, but there other ways to make vital QVC connections. Trae Bodage from "Three Custom Color Specialists," worked with a brand strategist who had previous dealings with QVC. You maybe should consider hiring a broker who deals with shopping networks frequently, such as 6 Ideas or Spectrum Red Group. While the application process is relatively easy to complete, teaming up with people "who know the ropes" could help secure your spot on QVC.Deliver the Perfect PitchAs previously mentioned, you're going to be facing some stiff competition, which is why you need to deliver the perfect pitch to get on air. Remember, you only have a couple of minutes to win the network over, so make sure that you keep your pitch short and sweet and focus on the following:Show how QVC will make a profit.Demonstrate the product.Highlight how customers can't live without it.Explain how it's different from the competition.Illustrate the mass appeal of your product.If you're a great salesperson with a great product and a perfect pitch, you really can be on your way into finding a very successful arrangement with QVC.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing

History[edit]




QVC's former logo used from 1994 until 16 September 2007.


QVC was founded on 13 June 1986 by Joseph Segel. One of the first brands to sign a two-year deal with QVC for its products was Sears.[3] The channel's first live broadcast took place at 7:30 p.m. ET on 24 November of that year, reaching 7.6 million cable television homes; the first item sold was a "Windsor Shower Companion" shower radio, presented by host John Eastman (Bob Bowersox was the first host seen on-screen).[4] The corporation later set a new record for first full-year fiscal sales for a new public company of $112 million.[5]
Initially broadcast live from 7:30 p.m. until midnight ET each weekday and all day on Saturdays and Sundays, the channel extended its live programming to 24 hours in January 1987. QVC acquired its top competitor, the Cable Value Network (CVN), in 1989. The $380 million deal contributed to a loss of $17 million during the next fiscal quarter, and then led to difficulties in the couple of years that followed.[6]
On 2 February 1995, Comcast purchased a majority shareholder stake in QVC, Inc., taking control of the corporation. That year, QVC kicked off the "Quest for America's Best: 50 in 50 Tour," a 50-week nationwide product search. Q2, a separate channel for more upscale shoppers, was founded in 1994 but abandoned in 1996.[7] QVC.com was started in 1996 as iQVC.[8]
In 1998, two former hosts filed a class-action lawsuit against QVC, claiming that they were discriminated against by the shopping channel based on their race. The lawsuit went on to state that QVC refused to allow non-white hosts any permanent daytime/primetime spots, which relegated them to the overnight hours, otherwise known as the "graveyard shift." Because of this, the non-white hosts were paid considerably less than the white hosts.[9][10]
In July 2003, Comcast sold its majority share to Liberty Media. On 23 September 2007, QVC U.S. rebranded itself, changing its logo on-air and online. The rebranding was accompanied by an advertising campaign with the tagline "iQdoU?" ("I shop QVC, do you?") that had preceded the rebrand with billboards in major U.S. cities. The iQdoU? campaign also included a "teaser" website.[11][12]
QVC was the first shopping network to offer a native high-definition simulcast channel in May 2009. The 4:3 cut for its standard definition feed in this 16:9 presentation is made to the right of the screen rather than on both sides of the 4:3 frame, allowing the network to place its graphics fully to the left and lower portions of the screen to maximize camera presentation space.
On 30 September 2010, at 11 p.m., QVC began broadcasting in Italy, both on satellite and through digital terrestrial television. In 2012, QVC partnered with China National Radio to take over operations of its home shopping network and associated internet e-commerce site. Its initial reach was reported to be 35 million households.
In 2013, QVC partnered with Ion Media Networks to bring its programming to broadcast television, through Ion Television. QVC began to be carried as the fifth digital subchannel on most Ion Television owned-and-operated stations beginning on 5 August 2013; due to technical limitations caused by the number of subchannels Ion requires its stations to carry, QVC is carried in a squeezed full-screen 4:3 format and is transmitted in standard definition. The channel is also broadcast on digital subchannels of low-powered television stations in selected areas. The broadcast service is branded as "QVC Over the Air", with an accompanying on-screen bug appearing on the lower right corner of the screen during the network's programming.
The owner of television shopping network QVC announced it is paying $2.4 billion to buy Internet retailer Zulily,[13] a flash-sales pioneer that has struggled recently with slowing sales gains.[14]
On July 6, 2017, QVC's parent company, Liberty Interactive, announced its intention to purchase the remaining 62% of stock it didn't already own of HSN, the rival home shopping channel. The all-stock deal is valued at $2.1 billion ($40.36 a share). [15][16][17]

Headquarters[edit]
QVC has its headquarters in West Chester, Pennsylvania by U.S. Route 202.[20][21] The $100 million QVC Studio Park complex, located on an 80 acres (32 ha) plot of land, opened in 1997.[22]
QVC US[edit]




QVC Outlet store in Frazer, Pennsylvania


QVC's U.S. operations are based in the Studio Park complex, which houses its corporate headquarters, studio and broadcasting facilities. Studio Park is the former corporate offices of Commodore Business Machines. Call center facilities are located in Chesapeake, Virginia, and San Antonio, Texas. QVC's distribution centers are located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Suffolk, Virginia; Florence, South Carolina; Rocky Mount, North Carolina and Ontario, CA. Its 2013 sales were worth $5.84 billion.[23]
QVC U.S. also operates a retail store at their Studio Park complex, and a series of outlet stores in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Frazer, Pennsylvania and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware,[24]
QVC broadcasts live in the United States 24/7, 364 days a year (pre-recorded on Christmas Day) to more than 100 million households, and ranks as the number two television network in terms of revenue (#1 in home shopping networks), with sales in 2015 giving a net revenue of $8.7 billion.
Every year the “QVC Presents ‘FFANY Shoes on Sale’” event is broadcast in which donated designer shoes are sold at half the suggested retail price and 80% of the proceeds go to breast cancer research and education. It is organized with the Fashion Footwear Association of New York, which runs a coinciding Shoes on Sale initiative along with an awards gala.[25][26][27][28]
QVC UK[edit]

QVC UK was launched on 1 October 1993. QVC UK's headquarters and broadcasting facilities are in Chiswick Park, West London.

QVC UK also operates three channels made up mostly of rerun segments from the live channel, QVC Beauty, QVC Extra and QVC Style. The company's UK sales in 2013 were worth $660 million.[23]
QVC UK's main channel broadcasts live 17 hours a day, 364 days a year. For the seven 'non-live' hours a day and on one day a year, Christmas Day, the main channel shows rerun segments from the live channel.
QVC Germany[edit]
Main article: QVC Germany
QVC Germany, incorporated in Düsseldorf, runs call centre operations from sites in Bochum and Kassel, whilst distribution is handled from a dedicated warehouse in Hückelhoven. The company's 2013 sales were worth $970 million.[23]
QVC Germany broadcasts live 17 hours a day, 363.5 days a year (the channel goes off-air on Christmas Eve (with no programming after noon) and Christmas Day). QVC has two additional channels in Germany, QVC Plus and QVC Beauty & Style.
QVC Japan[edit]
QVC Japan is based in Makuhari, where its corporate headquarters and call center facility are located. Distribution facilities are in Sakura City. The company's 2013 sales were worth $1.02 billion.[23]
QVC Italy[edit]
QVC Italy was launched in October 2010.[29] QVC Italy's headquarters and broadcasting facilities are located at Brugherio, near Milan. The company's 2013 sales were worth $130 million.[23]
QVC Italy broadcasts live 17 hours a day (although the channel runs 24 hours a day), 364 days a year. The primary distribution platforms for QVC Italy are digital terrestrial television and satellite.
QVC France[edit]
In the summer of 2015, QVC launched in France.[30] Before the launch, the company said it expected to create about 200 jobs in its first two years in the country. A studio center in suburban Paris produces the channel's content, which was available initially online, on mobile devices and on major satellite TV, cable TV and internet TV - with other platforms due to carry the signal 'very soon'.[31] The channel's corporate website said QVC stood for: Qualité, Valeur, Confiance, replacing convenience with (the French for) confidence.[32]
QVC/CNR (China)[edit]
QVC/CNR (China) is based in Beijing and operates both a television broadcast and associated e-commerce website cnrmall.com. The China operation is a 51/49 joint venture between state-owned China National Radio and QVC, based on the pre-existing CNR channel reaching 35 million households, with plans to grow to 195 million households that have digital cable.[33] Chinese law prohibits private control of television stations, so this is the maximum position QVC can hold in its Chinese operations. QVC/CNR broadcasts live programming 12 hours a day and then replays the previous 12-hour segment.[citation needed] The company's 2013 sales were worth $110 million.[23]

History[edit]




QVC's former logo used from 1994 until 16 September 2007.


QVC was founded on 13 June 1986 by Joseph Segel. One of the first brands to sign a two-year deal with QVC for its products was Sears.[3] The channel's first live broadcast took place at 7:30 p.m. ET on 24 November of that year, reaching 7.6 million cable television homes; the first item sold was a "Windsor Shower Companion" shower radio, presented by host John Eastman (Bob Bowersox was the first host seen on-screen).[4] The corporation later set a new record for first full-year fiscal sales for a new public company of $112 million.[5]
Initially broadcast live from 7:30 p.m. until midnight ET each weekday and all day on Saturdays and Sundays, the channel extended its live programming to 24 hours in January 1987. QVC acquired its top competitor, the Cable Value Network (CVN), in 1989. The $380 million deal contributed to a loss of $17 million during the next fiscal quarter, and then led to difficulties in the couple of years that followed.[6]
On 2 February 1995, Comcast purchased a majority shareholder stake in QVC, Inc., taking control of the corporation. That year, QVC kicked off the "Quest for America's Best: 50 in 50 Tour," a 50-week nationwide product search. Q2, a separate channel for more upscale shoppers, was founded in 1994 but abandoned in 1996.[7] QVC.com was started in 1996 as iQVC.[8]
In 1998, two former hosts filed a class-action lawsuit against QVC, claiming that they were discriminated against by the shopping channel based on their race. The lawsuit went on to state that QVC refused to allow non-white hosts any permanent daytime/primetime spots, which relegated them to the overnight hours, otherwise known as the "graveyard shift." Because of this, the non-white hosts were paid considerably less than the white hosts.[9][10]
In July 2003, Comcast sold its majority share to Liberty Media. On 23 September 2007, QVC U.S. rebranded itself, changing its logo on-air and online. The rebranding was accompanied by an advertising campaign with the tagline "iQdoU?" ("I shop QVC, do you?") that had preceded the rebrand with billboards in major U.S. cities. The iQdoU? campaign also included a "teaser" website.[11][12]
QVC was the first shopping network to offer a native high-definition simulcast channel in May 2009. The 4:3 cut for its standard definition feed in this 16:9 presentation is made to the right of the screen rather than on both sides of the 4:3 frame, allowing the network to place its graphics fully to the left and lower portions of the screen to maximize camera presentation space.
On 30 September 2010, at 11 p.m., QVC began broadcasting in Italy, both on satellite and through digital terrestrial television. In 2012, QVC partnered with China National Radio to take over operations of its home shopping network and associated internet e-commerce site. Its initial reach was reported to be 35 million households.
In 2013, QVC partnered with Ion Media Networks to bring its programming to broadcast television, through Ion Television. QVC began to be carried as the fifth digital subchannel on most Ion Television owned-and-operated stations beginning on 5 August 2013; due to technical limitations caused by the number of subchannels Ion requires its stations to carry, QVC is carried in a squeezed full-screen 4:3 format and is transmitted in standard definition. The channel is also broadcast on digital subchannels of low-powered television stations in selected areas. The broadcast service is branded as "QVC Over the Air", with an accompanying on-screen bug appearing on the lower right corner of the screen during the network's programming.
The owner of television shopping network QVC announced it is paying $2.4 billion to buy Internet retailer Zulily,[13] a flash-sales pioneer that has struggled recently with slowing sales gains.[14]
On July 6, 2017, QVC's parent company, Liberty Interactive, announced its intention to purchase the remaining 62% of stock it didn't already own of HSN, the rival home shopping channel. The all-stock deal is valued at $2.1 billion ($40.36 a share). [15][16][17]

Headquarters[edit]
QVC has its headquarters in West Chester, Pennsylvania by U.S. Route 202.[20][21] The $100 million QVC Studio Park complex, located on an 80 acres (32 ha) plot of land, opened in 1997.[22]
QVC US[edit]




QVC Outlet store in Frazer, Pennsylvania


QVC's U.S. operations are based in the Studio Park complex, which houses its corporate headquarters, studio and broadcasting facilities. Studio Park is the former corporate offices of Commodore Business Machines. Call center facilities are located in Chesapeake, Virginia, and San Antonio, Texas. QVC's distribution centers are located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Suffolk, Virginia; Florence, South Carolina; Rocky Mount, North Carolina and Ontario, CA. Its 2013 sales were worth $5.84 billion.[23]
QVC U.S. also operates a retail store at their Studio Park complex, and a series of outlet stores in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Frazer, Pennsylvania and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware,[24]
QVC broadcasts live in the United States 24/7, 364 days a year (pre-recorded on Christmas Day) to more than 100 million households, and ranks as the number two television network in terms of revenue (#1 in home shopping networks), with sales in 2015 giving a net revenue of $8.7 billion.
Every year the “QVC Presents ‘FFANY Shoes on Sale’” event is broadcast in which donated designer shoes are sold at half the suggested retail price and 80% of the proceeds go to breast cancer research and education. It is organized with the Fashion Footwear Association of New York, which runs a coinciding Shoes on Sale initiative along with an awards gala.[25][26][27][28]
QVC UK[edit]

QVC UK was launched on 1 October 1993. QVC UK's headquarters and broadcasting facilities are in Chiswick Park, West London. Call centre and distribution warehouse are situated in Knowsley, Merseyside. QVC UK also runs two outlet stores, one in Warrington, the other in Shrewsbury. QVC UK also operates three channels made up mostly of rerun segments from the live channel, QVC Beauty, QVC Extra and QVC Style. The company's UK sales in 2013 were worth $660 million.[23]
QVC UK's main channel broadcasts live 17 hours a day, 364 days a year. For the seven 'non-live' hours a day and on one day a year, Christmas Day, the main channel shows rerun segments from the live channel.
QVC Germany[edit]
Main article: QVC Germany
QVC Germany, incorporated in Düsseldorf, runs call centre operations from sites in Bochum and Kassel, whilst distribution is handled from a dedicated warehouse in Hückelhoven. The company's 2013 sales were worth $970 million.[23]
QVC Germany broadcasts live 17 hours a day, 363.5 days a year (the channel goes off-air on Christmas Eve (with no programming after noon) and Christmas Day). QVC has two additional channels in Germany, QVC Plus and QVC Beauty & Style.
QVC Japan[edit]
QVC Japan is based in Makuhari, where its corporate headquarters and call center facility are located. Distribution facilities are in Sakura City. The company's 2013 sales were worth $1.02 billion.[23]
QVC Italy[edit]
QVC Italy was launched in October 2010.[29] QVC Italy's headquarters and broadcasting facilities are located at Brugherio, near Milan. The company's 2013 sales were worth $130 million.[23]
QVC Italy broadcasts live 17 hours a day (although the channel runs 24 hours a day), 364 days a year. The primary distribution platforms for QVC Italy are digital terrestrial television and satellite.
QVC France[edit]
In the summer of 2015, QVC launched in France.[30] Before the launch, the company said it expected to create about 200 jobs in its first two years in the country. A studio center in suburban Paris produces the channel's content, which was available initially online, on mobile devices and on major satellite TV, cable TV and internet TV - with other platforms due to carry the signal 'very soon'.[31] The channel's corporate website said QVC stood for: Qualité, Valeur, Confiance, replacing convenience with (the French for) confidence.[32]
QVC/CNR (China)[edit]
QVC/CNR (China) is based in Beijing and operates both a television broadcast and associated e-commerce website cnrmall.com. The China operation is a 51/49 joint venture between state-owned China National Radio and QVC, based on the pre-existing CNR channel reaching 35 million households, with plans to grow to 195 million households that have digital cable.[33] Chinese law prohibits private control of television stations, so this is the maximum position QVC can hold in its Chinese operations. QVC/CNR broadcasts live programming 12 hours a day and then replays the previous 12-hour segment.[citation needed] The company's 2013 sales were worth $110 million.[23]

QVC was the first shopping network to offer a native high-definition simulcast channel in May 2009. The 4:3 cut for its standard definition feed in this 16:9 presentation is made to the right of the screen rather than on both sides of the 4:3 frame, allowing the network to place its graphics fully to the left and lower portions of the screen to maximize camera presentation space.
On 30 September 2010, at 11 p.m., QVC began broadcasting in Italy, both on satellite and through digital terrestrial television. In 2012, QVC partnered with China National Radio to take over operations of its home shopping network and associated internet e-commerce site. Its initial reach was reported to be 35 million households.
In 2013, QVC partnered with Ion Media Networks to bring its programming to broadcast television, through Ion Television. QVC began to be carried as the fifth digital subchannel on most Ion Television owned-and-operated stations beginning on 5 August 2013; due to technical limitations caused by the number of subchannels Ion requires its stations to carry, QVC is carried in a squeezed full-screen 4:3 format and is transmitted in standard definition. The channel is also broadcast on digital subchannels of low-powered television stations in selected areas. The broadcast service is branded as "QVC Over the Air", with an accompanying on-screen bug appearing on the lower right corner of the screen during the network's programming.
The owner of television shopping network QVC announced it is paying $2.4 billion to buy Internet retailer Zulily,[13] a flash-sales pioneer that has struggled recently with slowing sales gains.[14]
On July 6, 2017, QVC's parent company, Liberty Interactive, announced its intention to purchase the remaining 62% of stock it didn't already own of HSN, the rival home shopping channel. The all-stock deal is valued at $2.1 billion ($40.36 a share). [15][16][17]

QVC's distribution centers are located in Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Suffolk, Virginia; Florence, South Carolina; Rocky Mount, North Carolina and Ontario, CA.

QVC broadcasts live in the United States 24/7, 364 days a year (pre-recorded on Christmas Day) to more than 100 million households, and ranks as the number two television network in terms of revenue (#1 in home shopping networks), with sales in 2015 giving a net revenue of $8.7 billion.
Every year the “QVC Presents ‘FFANY Shoes on Sale’” event is broadcast in which donated designer shoes are sold at half the suggested retail price and 80% of the proceeds go to breast cancer research and education. It is organized with the Fashion Footwear Association of New York, which runs a coinciding Shoes on Sale initiative along with an awards gala.[25][26][27][28]
QVC UK[edit]

QVC Germany[edit]
Main article: QVC Germany
QVC Germany, incorporated in Düsseldorf, runs call centre operations from sites in Bochum and Kassel, whilst distribution is handled from a dedicated warehouse in Hückelhoven. The company's 2013 sales were worth $970 million.[23]
QVC Germany broadcasts live 17 hours a day, 363.5 days a year (the channel goes off-air on Christmas Eve (with no programming after noon) and Christmas Day). QVC has two additional channels in Germany, QVC Plus and QVC Beauty & Style.
QVC Japan[edit]
QVC Japan is based in Makuhari, where its corporate headquarters and call center facility are located. Distribution facilities are in Sakura City. The company's 2013 sales were worth $1.02 billion.[23]

QVC France[edit]
In the summer of 2015, QVC launched in France.[30] Before the launch, the company said it expected to create about 200 jobs in its first two years in the country. A studio center in suburban Paris produces the channel's content, which was available initially online, on mobile devices and on major satellite TV, cable TV and internet TV - with other platforms due to carry the signal 'very soon'.[31] The channel's corporate website said QVC stood for: Qualité, Valeur, Confiance, replacing convenience with (the French for) confidence.[32]
QVC/CNR (China)[edit]
QVC/CNR (China) is based in Beijing and operates both a television broadcast and associated e-commerce website cnrmall.com. The China operation is a 51/49 joint venture between state-owned China National Radio and QVC, based on the pre-existing CNR channel reaching 35 million households, with plans to grow to 195 million households that have digital cable.[33] Chinese law prohibits private control of television stations, so this is the maximum position QVC can hold in its Chinese operations. QVC/CNR broadcasts live programming 12 hours a day and then replays the previous 12-hour segment.[citation needed] The company's 2013 sales were worth $110 million.[23]
