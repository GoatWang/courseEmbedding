USMD’s mission is to make the health system work better for everyone, inspiring people to live healthier lives.
USMD Hospital Services
USMD currently manages the operations of two hospitals in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.  Both facilities are physician led and are ranked in the top 1% of hospitals nationwide as surveyed by Press Ganey, the healthcare industry’s leading independent ratings organization. Physicians prefer USMD’s model of hospital operations compared to traditional, non-physician-led facilities because we provide physicians with greater scheduling flexibility, more consistent nurse staffing and faster turnaround time between cases.
USMD Hospital at Arlington
USMD Hospital at Arlington is committed to clinical and surgical excellence every day. With nine oversized state-of-the-art operating rooms and two procedural rooms, USMD Hospital at Arlington is equipped for a wide variety of cases. The extensive surgical experience and expertise with four da Vinci Systems has made USMD Hospital at Arlington a leader in the DFW Metroplex, and one of the top ten robotic surgery programs in the world.
If an overnight stay is required, the hospital offers 34 private inpatient suites complete with WiFi, a small refrigerator, TV and an additional bed for an attending family visitor. What further differentiates this hospital from its competitors is its 1:5 nurse to patient ratio versus the national average of 1:8.
USMD Hospital at Fort Worth
USMD Hospital at Fort Worth is a unique physician-owned facility where clinical and surgical excellence is the everyday standard. With six state-of-the-art surgical suites, USMD Hospital at Fort Worth is equipped for a wide variety of cases. Designed and built with the patient in mind, USMD Hospital at Fort Worth offers separate entrances and facilities for pediatric and adult patients, including separate registration, waiting, pre-op, surgery and recovery areas.
If an overnight stay is required, the hospital offers eight private inpatient suites complete with WiFi, a small refrigerator, TV and an additional bed for an attending family visitor. What further differentiates USMD Hospital at Fort Worth from its competitors is its 1:4 nurse-to-patient ratio versus the national average of 1:8.

Physician Practice Management
USMD|MCNT
USMD|MCNT is a dynamic, multi-specialty physician practice group that provides professional medical services to patients throughout the DFW Metroplex. With nearly 50 physician clinics, many of which are multi-specialty, and more than 250 providers in more than 20 different specialties, USMD|MCNT offers convenient locations across DFW to care for every member of your family throughout every stage of their life. USMD physicians are committed to providing the highest-quality care and exceptional customer service, while promoting good health and guiding patients toward a healthy lifestyle. Most importantly, their physicians place the patients’ needs above all else. In addition, all of USMD’s primary care clinics are accredited by the Patient-Centered Medical Home Program, a recognition program that is part of the National Committee for Quality Assurance. This recognition means that USMD’s primary care clinics successfully display and utilize evidence-based, patient-centered processes that focus on highly coordinated patient care and long-term patient relationships.
USMD|UANT
USMD|UANT has more than 50 providers and 25 locations throughout the DFW Metroplex, and is one of the nation’s largest fully-integrated urology practices. USMD|UANT offers patients a unique combination of experienced and fellowship-trained physicians who use state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic facilities and are committed to delivering world-class care with a dedication to excellence and a relentless pursuit of quality.
