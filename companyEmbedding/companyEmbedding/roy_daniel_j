(Paperback book) In "Poetry In Verse," You will get the chance to read some of the most wonderful poetry that I hold deep within my heart. Poetry to me is an art, and a very good way to express your innermost feelings.  To capture your thoughts and put them in verse, lets people know how you're feeling and what kind of person you are. When I started writing poetry, I knew that I had found something. Something inside me that I just had to express. I mean what kind of world would we be living in without poetry. Always remember that if things are hard or you are just having a bad day, pick up a poem. I guarantee that it will help in someway. Thank you and God bless.

                                Very nice Sir. I think I should like to see a bit more revealed in your preview of the book. I think this way it would help to see further into your efforts... with 50 pages you might have the chance to share a bit more.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
* Denotes a required field. All required fields must be filled out for us to be able to process your form.
