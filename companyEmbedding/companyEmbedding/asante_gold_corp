Ghana - Africa’s Second Largest Gold Producer - +2.5M oz of gold per year

Gold has been continuously mined in Ghana for centuries since when it was part
 of the old Mali Empire in the 14th century, and in more recent times when it was known as 
the Gold Coast. During 116 years of near continuous production,Ghana’s 
largest underground mine, AngloGold Ashanti’s Obuasi mine, has recorded 
production exceeding 32M oz of Au. In the last 20 years, major and 
junior companies including Newmont, Kinross, Goldfields, Golden Star, 
and Perseus, have also committed significant resources to operations in 
the country.

Ghana is Africa’s second-largest gold producer, with output of more than 2.5 million troy ounces in 2016, and is the 9th 
largest gold producer in the World.Ghana is a mining friendly country and in 2015 ranked 6th in Africa on 
the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business barometer. Other features are 
two mining colleges and a large workforce trained in the disciplines of 
geology, exploration methods and mining engineering.

Ghana is politically stable with a parliamentary system and President, 
elections held every 4 years. It also recognizes traditional area “chief
 based” inputs in various high level and local governmental bodies. It 
is a modern developing country with strong economic ties in West Africa 
as well as with Europe, North America and China. It is the world’s 
second largest cocoa producer and is emerging as an oil-producing nation
 from offshore fields.

About Us
Asante Gold Corporation is a Ghana focused gold exploration and development company headquartered in Vancouver. Ghana is Africa’s number two gold producer and ninth in the World, and hosts numerous +10 million ounce gold deposits, including Obuasi, Tarkwa, and Ahafo. Some of the world’s leading gold producers are active here including Newmont, AngloGold Ashanti, Goldfields and Kinross. The new Asanko Gold Mine (former PMI Gold Obotan) is now in  production at over 200,000 oz per year.The Board is highly experienced, Chaired by Ned Goodman (Inductee Canadian Mining Hall of Fame), Douglas MacQuarrie President & CEO (former CEO PMI Gold), Bashir Ahmed VP (former Mine Manger of AngloGold Ashanti Obuasi Mine), Alex Heath (former investment banker Salman Partners) and Florian Riedl-Riedenstein (former investment banker).  Our Advisors to the Board include Alan McKerron former Director New Business for Anglo American; Nana Prah former advisor to the President of Ghana and Chairman of Perseus Ghana; and Eric Ewen  Prospector and discoverer of Keegan (now Asanko Gold) 5 Moz Esaase orebody.Our main focus is to put our high grade Kubi Gold mine back into production as an underground mine at circa 30koz to 40koz per year, via an exploration decline and toll milling. We are also exploring for the next big one - on our  Keyhole concessions (optioned from Sikasante Mining Company Limited); Betenase concession (optioned from Perseus Ghana) and Fahiakoba concession; and, subject to final closing and additional third party and governmental transfers and approvals, an additional eight concessions - two adjoining Kubi and six along strike to the south west of the the Asanko gold Mine.  These licenses have been explored in the past by many companies including BHP, Nevsun Resources and PMI Gold Corporation with many significant drill ‘discovery’ holes already outlined and requiring follow up detailed exploration.  We plan to capitalize on this gold-rich and growing mining environment by continuing to build our assets through exploration, development and acquisitions. CSE : ASE Frankfurt : 1A9OTC : ASGOF

Asante Gold Corp (CVE:ASE, CNSX:ASE) will start second phase drilling at the MEM area of the  Keyhole option property in Ghana in the middle of this month.
It is looking for new gold deposits. 
All of the significant gold values noted so far in the area are located within areas of anomalous high geophysical IP (induced polarization) results, the firm noted.




 

Looking at drill core 








Asante Gold Corp (CVE:ASE, CNSX:ASE) will start second phase drilling at the MEM area of the  Keyhole option property in Ghana in the middle of this month.

	It is looking for new gold deposits.

	All of the significant gold values noted so far in the area are located within areas of anomalous high geophysical IP (induced polarization) results, the firm noted.

	The work will see 800 metres of diamond drilling completed to follow up on the high-grade gold discovery from drill hole MEM17-001B, which hit 13.12 grams per tonne (g/t) gold over three metres at a depth of 120 metres below the historical MEM showing.

	"The strong correlation of gold mineralization with high geophysical IP results in the MEM area gives us a powerful tool to explore for new gold deposits under the extensive alluvial mined areas which have not been explored to date," said Douglas R. MacQuarrie, president and chief executive of Asante.

	"These areas stretch over two kilometres to the north and south of the MEM showing."

	The Keyhole option covers a 6km long section of the Ankobra River and lies  at the intersection of three major regional gold-mineralized trends.

	Keyhole is under option from Sikasante Mining and adjoins Asante's Ashanti II gold project.

	Asante can earn up to 100% of the project by completing $500,000 in work over four years, issuing 1.25 million shares and reserving for Sikasante a 2% net smelter return (NSR) royalty.
