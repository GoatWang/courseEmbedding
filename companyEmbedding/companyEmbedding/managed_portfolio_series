Morningstar® Managed PortfoliosStrategies for fee-based financial advisors.


OverviewFund PortfoliosStock PortfoliosETF PortfoliosOnline Program PlatformCommunication ResourcesAdvisor Support ServicesComprehensive SolutionFund PortfoliosMorningstar® Managed Portfolios offers a series of fund portfolios designed to achieve specific return objectives within controlled risk parameters to match a spectrum of investment objectives. Each portfolio is developed using quantitative and qualitative analyses and is actively managed to ensure the results of each portfolio remain in line with its stated objective.Asset Allocation SeriesThe Asset Allocation Series portfolios are strategically built to meet different investment time horizons and risk levels. An appropriate framework is determined for each portfolio using several optimization and portfolio construction techniques to achieve specific long-term risk and return objectives through diversification among asset classes.Retirement Income Series This series of portfolios offers strategies designed to meet a client’s payout needs through all stages of retirement. Depending on the anticipated withdrawal period, these portfolios aim to support appropriate annual cash distributions over the recommended time horizon in retirement. Focused Allocation SeriesThe mutual fund portfolios within the Focused Allocation Series are designed to provide direct exposure to particular sectors of the capital markets. They can be used to focus investments on specific market segments and diversify existing portfolios.Portfolio construction: Selecting the right fundsMorningstar Investment Services constructs portfolios through a proprietary process that is applied to the entire mutual fund universe. First, quantitative screens identify funds with total assets that exceed Morningstar’s peer group minimum. Then proprietary peer group rankings reduce the potential universe further, using a system that includes reviews of fund holdings, historical performance, and risk. After completing the rankings, extensive qualitative analysis is used to determine the appropriate short funds list. Strategic combinations of funds are evaluated to ensure they interact well in a portfolio and achieve the desired level of diversification. These fund combinations are tested to establish how a portfolio would have reacted in past and present market conditions.Active monitoring: Keeping results in line with strategyTo achieve defined goals, the investment team actively monitors and manages each portfolio. This involves direct contact with fund managers, holdings analysis, rebalancing, and adding or replacing funds as necessary. Monitoring occurs at the portfolio, fund, and market levels, and portfolios are rebalanced as needed. Advisors are informed of monitoring activities.Change execution: Efficiently making adjustments to each portfolioPortfolio changes are made when the structure deviates from the desired investment strategy, when a change in a fund indicates that performance expectations will not be met, or when market conditions change. The investment team carefully considers how such changes could affect clients and their portfolios.Take ActionGet Program InformationLearn MoreBrochuresProduct Fact SheetsCustomer SupportOnline LoginThe Morningstar Investment Management division is a division of Morningstar and includes Morningstar Associates, Ibbotson Associates, and Morningstar Investment Services, all registered investment advisors and wholly owned subsidiaries of Morningstar, Inc.

Portfolio Management
TrilogyCapital builds investment models based on risk-conscious asset selection which allows our clients to invest based on their preferences for volatility, management style and long-term performance potential. We believe that long-term success is the product of prudent asset allocation managed through diversiﬁed portfolios.














CORE PORTFOLIO SERIES is the family of investment strategies focused on globally- balanced portfolios of relatively low-cost investment solutions. These strategies are intended to give broad market exposure not focused on any one sector or geographic region, providing index-like returns with lower risk over full market cycles.
STRATEGIC TACTICAL SMARTCAP








SELECT PORTFOLIO SERIES is the family of investment strategies focused on actively-managed portfolios of sector or strategy focused securities.These strategies seek to provide investors with non-correlated returns to the CORE SERIES as well as potential alpha as compared to standard benchmarks.
DEEP VALUE DEFENSIVE EQUITY DIVIDEND









SLEEVE PORTFOLIO SERIES is the family of investment strategies focused on portfolios for smaller accounts and automatic investment plans. These strategies are designed for investors who cannot meet the minimums for the CORE SERIES and would still like access to an globally-invested, actively-rebalanced strategy.
MARKETCAP









CONTINUITY PORTFOLIO SERIES is the asset management arrangement by which we oversee long-term held assets such as fee- based annuities, REITs and bond ladders. CONTINUITY PORTFOLIOS will often be unique to the investor but require less active management due to the buy-and-hold strategy.




All investment strategies have the potential for profit or loss. Different types of investments involve varying degrees of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment will either be suitable or profitable for a client’s investment portfolio. TrilogyCapital Risk Profiles range from 6 to 1 with a Profile 6 being most aggressive and risky and a Profile 1 being the most conservative and risk averse. TrilogyCapital’s intention is to manage portfolio risk just as much as return while taking clients’ risk objectives and goals into consideration. Economic factors, market conditions, and investment strategies will affect the performance of any portfolio and there are no assurances that it will match or outperform any particular benchmark. An investor should consider their Model Portfolio’s investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses before investing. This and other important information about TrilogyCapital can be found in the firm’s ADV. Some clients of TrilogyCapital experience different performance results due to unique situations including cash distributions, non-model holdings, and additional situations particular to an individual client. An investment into TrilogyCapital’s portfolios are not insured or guaranteed by the FDIC or any other government agency.

Legal Disclaimer:

Capital distributions are repayments of principal that will reduce the principal amount invested in the BMO Fixed Cash Flow Plus Deposit (“Cash Flow Deposit”) and the investor’s adjusted cost base of the Cash Flow Deposit.

Investors should consult their own tax advisors for advice with respect to the tax consequences of an investment in Cash Flow Deposits, based on their particular circumstances.
Cash Flow Deposits do not represent deposits insured under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act or any other deposit insurance regime. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Master Information Statement dated August 1, 2014.

Investments in the Cash Flow Deposits are not mutual fund investments. They are investments in principal protected deposit notes issued by Bank of Montreal and will constitute direct, unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of Bank of Montreal. Details regarding the calculations and payments of interest, the Fixed Cash Flow Plus Portfolio (Cash Flow Portfolio), capital distributions, certain risk factors and certain federal income tax considerations of investing in the Cash Flow Deposits will be contained in the Master Information Statement, which will be available through your branch investment professional or on our public website at ww.bmo.com/fixedcashflow.

This summary is issued for information purposes only to provide a general overview of the Cash Flow Deposits and does not constitute investment advice or an offer to sell or a solicitation to purchase. An investment in Cash Flow Deposits is subject to certain risks, which investors should consider and, in particular, should evaluate the specific risk factors set out in the Master Information Statement and Series Supplement. Investors should read the related Master Information Statement and Series Supplement carefully before investing and discuss Cash Flow Deposit suitability with their branch investment professional. The Cash Flow Deposits may not be suitable for all types of investors; the prices and value of the Cash Flow Deposits may fluctuate and/or be adversely affected by a number of factors. The fluctuation of the value of the Cash Flow Portfolio will directly impact the variable return, if any, on the Cash Flow Deposits. At maturity, the variable return, if any, will be equal to the amount by which the Deposit Value on the third business day before the Cash Flow Deposit matures exceeds the Remaining Deposit Balance when the Cash Flow Deposit matures. If the Deposit Value on the third business day before the Cash Flow Deposit matures is equal to or less than the Remaining Deposit Balance at maturity then you will not receive any variable return on your Cash Flow Deposits. It is possible that no variable return will be paid on the Cash Flow Deposits. The Cash Flow Deposits have not been and will not be rated by any credit rating organization.

Neither Bank of Montreal nor any of its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, BMO) make any assurances, representations or warranties with respect to accuracy, reliability or completeness of information contained herein. Furthermore, BMO makes no recommendation concerning the Cash Flow Deposits or the suitability of investing in securities generally or the Cash Flow Deposits in particular.

† In order to receive the Guaranteed Maturity Amount, investors must remain invested in the fund until the fund's target end date. If an investor redeems any of his or her units of the fund prior to the target end date, the investor will receive only the net asset value per unit on the date of redemption, which may be less than the Guaranteed Maturity Amount. Please read the prospectus before investing and for important information on the Guaranteed Maturity Amount.

4The asset allocation strategy for BMO LifeStage Plus Funds determines the balance between the Mutual Fund Component and the Fixed Income Component based on a number of factors, including the remaining time until the Target End Date, the amount of the fund's portfolio required to cover the Guaranteed Maturity Amount, the state of equity markets and any changes in interest rates. Once a Fund's portfolio has been adjusted, the portfolio cannot be readjusted to any previous target asset mix.
