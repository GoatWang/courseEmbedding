Imation Corp.1 Imation WayOakdale, Minnesota 55128
Attention: Board of Directors
Gentlemen:
I write on behalf of Clinton Group, Inc. ("Clinton Group"), the investment manager of several funds and partnerships that collectively own a stake in the common stock of Imation Corp. ("Imation" or the "Company"). We continue to buy shares of Imation today.
We own common shares of the Company because we believe there is significant untapped value at the Company.  However, we are reluctant buyers today, even at these valuations, given the track record of the management team and board of directors over the past few years.  I believe the market shares our view on the prospects of the Company given the low enterprise valuation and the stock price near $3.00 per share today.
We do not believe this predicament has to persist, and that shareholders deserve better.  As you know, on November 18th and also today, we submitted a notice to nominate three individuals to stand for election against the incumbent class of directors up for election in 2015.  We believe the individuals in our notice possess the domain expertise, operational capability, turnaround experience and financial acumen to move Imation forward from the depths it languishes in today.  In fact, upon a successful proxy contest and if mutually acceptable, Clinton Group would welcome the opportunity to invest in common equity at a premium to prevailing market prices as we believe under the right leadership, the stock could at least triple in value from here.  In our subsequent proxy filings in the coming months, we will elaborate on such plans to achieve this reversal in performance.
Let's look closer at our nominees.  Bob Fernander is a long-time executive in the storage and software sectors and possesses significant Chief Executive Officer experience and domain expertise in cloud storage, hyper converged storage and compute, big data, analytics, IP video, VDI, virtualized storage & compute, SAN, NAS and DAS.  Bob can evaluate the product roadmap for Nexsan and IronKey, among other business lines, and let us know "what we have," "what it can be," and "what it is worth."  Barry Kasoff has owned and operated his own management consulting and turnaround firm since 1997.  He has served as the Chief Restructuring Officer in a number of companies that were going through troubled business environments.  The board may not think the situation at Imation necessitates a restructuring focus, but Clinton Group does, and I have the utmost confidence Barry can lead an internal team or external team to that end.  I am confident that a significant restructuring effort can deliver a cash flow positive business, eliminate the corporate waste, redefine the return thresholds for capital allocation, eliminate or dispose of business lines not accretive to the whole, and deliver significant equity value creation to all shareholders. Finally, and humbly, I would bring the shareholder perspective to Imation's Board of Directors that has been absent for so long.  Without prejudice, I would look with an entrepreneur's eye at all of the companies expense categories and capital needs, examine decisions to divest non-performing or low-return on invested capital businesses, and evaluate returning cash to shareholders or reinvesting excess capital at high returns to deliver outsized equity returns.
We will not use this letter as a forum to proffer the case for significant change at the corporate leadership of the company, as I believe a cursory view of public information would bear the facts "that speak for themselves."  In forthcoming proxy materials, we will expound in great detail the missteps by management, the failed capital deployment strategy, empirical evidence of underperformance relative to peers, and the egregious choices the Board has made about its own compensation.  
Additionally, we read with great interest the Company's press release last week on the Board's intention to appoint Dr. Geoff Barrall on December 17, 2014.  It was interesting and curious for two reasons.  Firstly, we note that in an August 2014, Imation announced the resignation of two board members, and the Chairman's statement that the resignations were tied to "a long-term plan to both reduce the size and cost of the board."   Finally, our institution knows Dr. Barrall personally, and I was surprised not to receive a call from him prior to the press release.  Given that our nomination notice was filed with the Company almost a month prior to Dr. Barrall's appointment, I would assume that a forthright Board of Directors would notify candidates of a looming proxy contest prior to his or her deliberations before accepting such a position.
I bring this up as segue to our cautionary views on the topic of board entrenchment.  Given our experience in situations like these over the many years, we have seen every trick in the book of an entrenched board – surrounding themselves with attorneys, advisors and crises management firms, altering the Company's bylaws, contesting nomination notices and other procedural matters, adding members to the Board, engaging bankers to pursue strategic alternatives and terminating the CEO abruptly.  In our last two proxy contests were we sought and prevailed in replacing a majority of directors, Stillwater Mining, Inc. and EVINE Live, Inc., (fka ValueVision Media, Inc.), management and incumbent directors spent $4.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively, on such defensive and entrenchment endeavors.  In each case, our expenditure as a firm was a fraction of the amounts spent by such incumbents (as they were our dollars not shareholders dollars we were spending), and the proxy contests ended in decisive votes in favor of Clinton Group's nominees.  It should not be expensive for you to present the Board's track and go-forward strategy to shareholders and allow them to decide the fate of their Company.  We encourage our fellow shareholders to speak their mind to the management team and Board on this very issue and urge them not to engage in this wasteful spending for the sole purpose of the Board's entrenchment.
In sum, we have spoken to a number of large shareholders of the Company today and believe that there is support for significant change at the Company's corporate leadership.  In the upcoming new year, we look forward to bringing our case to shareholders, and more importantly, articulating our vision for the path forward.  
Sincerely yours,
//ss//

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.

If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0 SanctionsWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?No sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.Background CheckWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0 Board ActionsWhat are board actions?No board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.Background CheckWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.
