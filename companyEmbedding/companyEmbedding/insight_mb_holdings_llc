  Precision Holdings Acquires McSwain Manufacturing















































Precision Holdings Acquires McSwain Manufacturing
Insight Equity Holdings LLC (December 3rd, 2015)
 

SOUTHLAKE, Texas and WINDSOR, Connecticut – December 3, 2015 – Insight Equity Holdings LLC (“Insight Equity”), the Southlake, Texas-based private equity firm, today announced that its precision machining portfolio company Precision Holdings acquired Cincinnati, Ohio-based McSwain Manufacturing Corporation.
Founded in 1972, McSwain Manufacturing is an expert in complex manufacturing specializing in tight tolerance, large turning and milling operations primarily supporting the industrial gas turbine market.
“The combination of our Midstate Machine business in Winslow, Maine and McSwain Manufacturing creates a great precision machining partnership – combining complementary and scale capabilities to support our customers’ growth in the power generation, aerospace, and oil and gas industries,” said Precision Holdings CEO Duane Pekar.
“The acquisition of McSwain strengthens Precision Holdings’ core competency in large turning and milling, and also aligns the best practices of two leading companies in the industry. We’re very excited to have McSwain Manufacturing join our team,” added James Jackson, a Senior Vice President at Insight Equity.
Victor Vescovo, COO & Managing Partner at Insight Equity, noted “We’re very impressed with what Ken Bertrand and his team at McSwain have accomplished.  We look forward to working with them for years to come and introducing them to our growing capabilities in hard-metal additive manufacturing.”
Precision Holdings’ current precision machining portfolio includes Midstate Machine (Winslow, Maine); additive manufacturing expert CalRAM Inc. (Camarillo, California.); and now McSwain Manufacturing Corporation.

Start Preamble
Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 18a, as added by Title II of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, requires persons contemplating certain mergers or acquisitions to give the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General advance notice and to wait designated periods before consummation of such plans. Section 7A(b)(2) of the Act permits the agencies, in individual cases, to terminate this waiting period prior to its expiration and requires that notice of this action be published in the Federal Register.
The following transactions were granted early termination—on the dates indicated—of the waiting period provided by law and the premerger notification rules. The listing for each transaction includes the transaction number and the parties to the transaction. The grants were made by the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Neither agency intends to take any action with respect to these proposed acquisitions during the applicable waiting period.Start Printed Page 10485

Management Team
Thought leaders, innovative engineers, additive manufacturing experts — the layers of our management team keep adding up. And like the layers of additive manufacturing itself, the whole is greater because of the fusion of its parts.

Victor Vescovo, CEO
Victor is Chief Operating Officer and Managing Partner of Insight Equity.  He has overall responsibility for the firm’s origination of new transactions and arranging financing, but also maintains deep involvement in the operations of selected portfolio companies. Victor is also Head of Insight Equity’s New York office.
Before co-founding Insight Equity, Victor was Vice President of Product Development at Military Advantage, a venture-backed company sold to Monster Worldwide in 2004. Prior to that, he was a senior manager at Bain & Company where he focused on merger integration and operational improvement cases.
In the early nineties, Victor worked in the mergers & acquisitions department of Lehman Brothers where he was responsible for company due diligence and transaction execution, as well as working overseas in the Middle East advising the Saudi government on business investments.
