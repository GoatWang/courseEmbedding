Ruth's Hospitality Group
Thank you for visiting the Ruth's Hospitality Group, Inc. website. We are a leading publicly owned 
    (NASDAQ: RUTH) restaurant company focused exclusively on the upscale dining segment.
The Ruth's Chris Steak House legacy began when Ruth Fertel mortgaged her home for $22,000 to purchase 
    "Chris Steak House," a 60-seat restaurant located in New Orleans, Louisiana. More than 40 years 
    later, our success continues to be driven by our adherence to Ruth's core values, which are to deliver 
    the highest quality food, beverages and service in a warm and inviting atmosphere.

ABOUT RUTH'S HOSPITALITY GROUP
Thank you for visiting the Ruth's Hospitality Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: RUTH) website. This is the place 
            where you'll find the latest company news and overview of our business.
Our portfolio of restaurants includes our legendary Ruth's Chris Steak House brand, which was founded 
            in 1965 by Ruth Fertel.
The Ruth's Chris Steak House legacy began when Ruth Fertel mortgaged her home for $22,000 to purchase 
            the "Chris Steak House," a 60-seat restaurant located in New Orleans, Louisiana. More than 40 years 
            later, our success continues to be driven by our adherence to Ruth's core values, which are to deliver 
            the highest quality food, beverages and service in a warm and inviting atmosphere.
Today, there are more than 150 Ruth’s Chris Steak Houses, including 20 international franchisee-owned
             restaurants in Mexico, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tokyo, Aruba, Canada and Dubai.

Ruth's Hospitality Group is the largest fine dining company in the world, with a focus on American steakhouse and seafood restaurants. They have over 160 locations worldwide. The group was formed in May 2008, shortly after Ruth's Chris Steak House acquired the Mitchell's Fish Market and Columbus Fish Market brands from Cameron Mitchell Restaurants.[3] The company was rebranded with a new name by CEO Mike McDonnell to reflect the wider diversity of restaurants in its portfolio.

Restaurant brands[edit]
Ruth's Hospitality Group owns five restaurant brands, which are a mixture of company-owned and franchised restaurants located both in the USA and overseas.

Ruth's Chris Steak House
Mitchell's Fish Market
Mitchell's Steakhouse
Columbus Fish Market
Cameron's Steakhouse

All the restaurant brands focus on offering high quality steak and seafood. All the steak is USDA Prime, and fresh seafood is flown in daily. They are “chain of custody” certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.
The wine list features over 200 labels, mostly from California, and has won numerous awards. The cocktail menu includes contemporary versions of classic cocktails. Most locations offer private dining, and the company also offers outside catering and a wedding service through the Ruth's Weddings brand.[4][5]
Performance[edit]
The period immediately after the acquisition of the Mitchell's restaurants in February 2008 was turbulent, and resulted in the ousting of CEO Craig Miller, who was replaced by Mike O'Donnell in April 2008.[6] In 2009, RHGI reported declining revenues at both the Ruth's Chris and the Mitchell's brands, with a drop of 22% in Q2 2009.[7] By 2010, O'Donnell had begun to reverse the decline, and in 2011, he was able to report an increase of 9.2% in revenue for Ruth's Chris, and a decrease of just 2% for Mitchell's. Overall revenues rose by $15.9m to $353.6m.[8] In a statement to shareholders, he attributed this to their growing success in private dining and catering facilities, as well as improved services for business customers.[9]
In February 2013, RHGI reported a rise in revenues of 7.9% to $398.6 million in 2012 compared to $369.6 million in the prior year. They noted that 4th quarter sales at Ruth's Chris restaurants were up by 7.0% on the previous year, representing the 11th consecutive quarterly increase in sales and 20% growth over three years. The Mitchell's brands showed an increase of 5.2% over the previous year.[1] O'Donnell attributed the improvements to the success of the fixed-price Ruth's Classics menu and the Sizzle, Swizzle, Swirl Happy Hour at Ruth's, and to the Reel Delicious lunch promotion at Mitchell's.[10]
RHGI continues to add new restaurants to the Ruth's Chris chain, most recently in Harrah's casino in Las Vegas in January 2013, after the previous Las Vegas location on Flamingo closed in 2009.[11][12] The company has announced plans for 2013 that include expanding the Ruth's Chris brand into China,[13] a new Ruth's restaurant in Denver, CO, and four or five new franchised Ruth's locations.[1]

Thank you for visiting the Ruth's Hospitality Group, Inc. website. We are a leading publicly owned 
    (NASDAQ: RUTH) restaurant company focused exclusively on the upscale dining segment.

    "Chris Steak House," a 60-seat restaurant located in New Orleans, Louisiana. More than 40 years 
    later, our success continues to be driven by our adherence to Ruth's core values, which are to deliver 
    the highest quality food, beverages and service in a warm and inviting atmosphere.

Ruth's Hospitality Group is the largest fine dining company in the world, with a focus on American steakhouse and seafood restaurants. They have over 160 locations worldwide. The group was formed in May 2008, shortly after Ruth's Chris Steak House acquired the Mitchell's Fish Market and Columbus Fish Market brands from Cameron Mitchell Restaurants.[3] The company was rebranded with a new name by CEO Mike McDonnell to reflect the wider diversity of restaurants in its portfolio.

Restaurant brands[edit]
Ruth's Hospitality Group owns five restaurant brands, which are a mixture of company-owned and franchised restaurants located both in the USA and overseas.

Ruth's Chris Steak House
Mitchell's Fish Market
Mitchell's Steakhouse
Columbus Fish Market
Cameron's Steakhouse

All the restaurant brands focus on offering high quality steak and seafood. All the steak is USDA Prime, and fresh seafood is flown in daily. They are “chain of custody” certified by the Marine Stewardship Council.
The wine list features over 200 labels, mostly from California, and has won numerous awards. The cocktail menu includes contemporary versions of classic cocktails. Most locations offer private dining, and the company also offers outside catering and a wedding service through the Ruth's Weddings brand.[4][5]
Performance[edit]
The period immediately after the acquisition of the Mitchell's restaurants in February 2008 was turbulent, and resulted in the ousting of CEO Craig Miller, who was replaced by Mike O'Donnell in April 2008.[6] In 2009, RHGI reported declining revenues at both the Ruth's Chris and the Mitchell's brands, with a drop of 22% in Q2 2009.[7] By 2010, O'Donnell had begun to reverse the decline, and in 2011, he was able to report an increase of 9.2% in revenue for Ruth's Chris, and a decrease of just 2% for Mitchell's. Overall revenues rose by $15.9m to $353.6m.[8] In a statement to shareholders, he attributed this to their growing success in private dining and catering facilities, as well as improved services for business customers.[9]
In February 2013, RHGI reported a rise in revenues of 7.9% to $398.6 million in 2012 compared to $369.6 million in the prior year. They noted that 4th quarter sales at Ruth's Chris restaurants were up by 7.0% on the previous year, representing the 11th consecutive quarterly increase in sales and 20% growth over three years. The Mitchell's brands showed an increase of 5.2% over the previous year.[1] O'Donnell attributed the improvements to the success of the fixed-price Ruth's Classics menu and the Sizzle, Swizzle, Swirl Happy Hour at Ruth's, and to the Reel Delicious lunch promotion at Mitchell's.[10]
RHGI continues to add new restaurants to the Ruth's Chris chain, most recently in Harrah's casino in Las Vegas in January 2013, after the previous Las Vegas location on Flamingo closed in 2009.[11][12] The company has announced plans for 2013 that include expanding the Ruth's Chris brand into China,[13] a new Ruth's restaurant in Denver, CO, and four or five new franchised Ruth's locations.[1]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
