Essex constructs its portfolios with a common denominator of defining a company’s growth potential through its fundamentals, not its sector classification or valuation.  We craft our portfolios to balance dynamic growth companies with sustainable growth companies believing that our portfolios can participate in up markets and offer defense in down markets.  In the background of each portfolio is a team of research analysts whose original and extensive analysis provides a steady flow of new ideas as well as an informative picture of our current positions.  Essex builds and maintains each portfolio with a well-defined and consistent investment process in which understandable buy and sell disciplines and strict risk parameters provide a uniform method of replication across the various market segments offered to our clients.
