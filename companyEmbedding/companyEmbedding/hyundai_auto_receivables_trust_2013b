Privacy StatementIntroductionAs a valued customer, we want to ensure your private information is kept private and only shared with those companies who are authorized either by yourself or as allowed or required by law.  This document explains our privacy policy, gives you reasons why we ask for the type of information we do, and if we do reserve a right to share information with non-affiliated third parties, lets you "opt-out" of our reservation to do so.  Please take a moment to read this entire policy.Collection of InformationThe purchase of a motor vehicle requires considerable accumulation of nonpublic personal information.  For example, if we sell or lease you a vehicle - extending you credit at your request - we will receive information from you in order to determine your creditworthiness.  We may also obtain information from a credit-reporting agency.  We may also obtain information from third parties such as employers, references and insurance companies.Some of the information we obtain from you may be required by state of federal agencies, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles or the Internal Revenue Service. This information may be required even if you were to pay cash for your vehicle. Examples would be a driver's license or social security number.Protecting Your InformationWe safeguard nonpublic personal information according to established industry standards and procedures.  We maintain physical and electronic safeguards that comply with state and federal law.  We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees and outside contractors who need to know the information to provide product or service to you.  We prohibit our employees and agents from giving information about you to anyone in a manner that would violate any applicable law or our privacy policy.Information SharingUnless we have indicated our desire to share your nonpublic personal information with non-affiliated third parties (by checking the box in the section below), we share information:A) For everyday business purposes, such as to process transactions, maintain account(s), respond to court orders and legal investigations, or report to credit bureaus.B) For purposes of processing a sale or lease transaction as your request or authorize, such as submitting information to third party financial institutions that may be requested to take an assignment of the contract or verifying insurance coverage information.C) When using outside service providers to help us provide you with products and services.  Before providing information to our service providers we enter into contractual agreements prohibiting them from disclosing or using the information other than for the purpose it was disclosed.D) With "Affiliated" companies.  Companies that are affiliated with us include any company that controls us, any company we control, or any company under common control with us. 



(enter your initials)I am interested in purchasing or leasing a vehicle and request that my Consumer Credit Report be obtained, at no cost to me, in order to help determine the types and extent of financing which may be available to me.

RATINGS RATIONALE 




The actions reflect expenses that were not previously taken into account 
in the ratings for these transactions and that are offset by the strength 
of the sponsor and the deal structures. Moody's has learned that 
for Hyundai securitizations, Hyundai Capital America does not subtract 
the costs associated with the repossession of vehicles from the liquidation 
proceeds allocated to the trust, and thus does not include repossession 
expenses in reported net loss. These costs are absorbed into corporate 
costs and are not compensated by the trusts.




Given Hyundai's current practice of absorbing the repossession expenses, 
consideration of these expenses does not impact historical static loss 
curves or increase Moody's lifetime cumulative net loss (CNL) expectations 
for these transactions. For all the Hyundai securitizations except 
the 2013-B and 2013-C transactions, the lifetime CNL 
expectations remain unchanged and range between 0.90% and 
2.00%. The CNL expectations for the 2013-B 
and 2013-C transactions were lowered to 1.00% from 
1.15% as transactions are performing better than previously 
anticipated.




The upgrades resulted from the build-up of credit enhancement owing 
to sequential pay structures, non-declining overcollateralization 
and reserve accounts as well as yield supplement overcollateralization.




Below are key performance metrics (as of March 2017 distribution date) 
and credit assumptions for the affected transactions. The credit 
assumptions are Moody's expected lifetime CNL expectation (expressed as 
a percentage of the original pool balance), Moody's lifetime remaining 
CNL expectation and Moody's Aaa Level (expressed as a percentage 
of the current pool balance). The Aaa Level is the level of credit 
enhancement that would be consistent with a Aaa (sf) rating for the given 
asset pool. Performance metrics include pool factor, which 
is the ratio of the current collateral balance and the original collateral 
balance at closing; total credit enhancement (expressed as a percentage 
of the outstanding collateral pool balance adjusted for YSOC), which 
typically consists of subordination, overcollateralization, 
reserve fund; and YSOC. The YSOC compensates for the lower 
APR on the subvened loans.

PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGY




The Credit Rating for Hyundai prime auto loan ABS was assigned in accordance 
with Moody's existing Methodology entitled "Moody's Global Approach to 
Rating Auto Loan-and Lease-Backed ABS," dated 6 October 
2016. Please note that on 22 March 2017, Moody's released 
a Request for Comment, in which it has requested market feedback 
on potential revisions to its Approach to Assessing Counterparty Risks 
in Structured Finance. If the revised Methodology is implemented 
as proposed, the Credit Ratings on Hyundai prime auto loan ABS are 
not expected to be affected. Please refer to Moody's Request 
for Comment, titled " Moody's Proposes Revisions to Its Approach 
to Assessing Counterparty Risks in Structured Finance," for 
further details regarding the implications of the proposed Methodology 
revisions on certain Credit Ratings.






Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings: 





Up




Levels of credit protection that are greater than necessary to protect 
investors against current expectations of loss could lead to an upgrade 
of the rating. Moody's current expectations of loss may be 
better than its original expectations because of lower frequency of default 
by the underlying obligors or appreciation in the value of the vehicles 
that secure the obligor's promise of payment. The US job 
market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers of performance. 
Other reasons for better performance than Moody's expected include 
changes in servicing practices to maximize collections on the loans or 
refinancing opportunities that result in a prepayment of the loan.




Down




Levels of credit protection that are insufficient to protect investors 
against current expectations of loss could lead to a downgrade of the 
ratings. Moody's current expectations of loss may be worse 
than its original expectations because of higher frequency of default 
by the underlying obligors of the loans or a deterioration in the value 
of the vehicles that secure the obligor's promise of payment. 
The US job market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers 
of performance. Other reasons for worse performance than Moody's 
expected include poor servicing, error on the part of transaction 
parties, lack of transactional governance and fraud.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.




Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

RATINGS RATIONALE 




The upgrades resulted from the build-up of credit enhancement due 
to sequential pay structures, non-declining overcollateralization, 
and non-declining reserve accounts. The cumulative lifetime 
net losses (CNL) remain unchanged for all outstanding transactions, 
as they are performing in line with our previous expectations. 
The CNL expectations range between 0.90% and 1.50%.




Below are key performance metrics (as of the May 2016 distribution date) 
and credit assumptions for each affected transaction. Credit assumptions 
include Moody's expected lifetime CNL expressed as a percentage of the 
original pool balance; Moody's lifetime remaining CNL expectation 
and Moody's Aaa (sf) level expressed as a percentage of the current pool 
balance. The Aaa level is the level of credit enhancement that 
would be consistent with a Aaa (sf) rating for the given asset pool. 
Performance metrics include pool factor, which is the ratio of the 
current collateral balance to the original collateral balance at closing; 
total credit enhancement, (expressed as a percentage of the outstanding 
collateral pool balance adjusted for YSOC), which typically consists 
of subordination, overcollateralization, reserve fund, 
Excess Spread per annum and YSOC. The YSOC is a form of soft credit 
enhancement implemented as a compensation for the lower APR on subvened 
loans.

PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGY




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Moody's Global Approach 
to Rating Auto Loan- and Lease-Backed ABS" published in 
December 2015. Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of ratings: 




Up




Levels of credit protection that are greater than necessary to protect 
investors against current expectations of loss could lead to an upgrade 
of the rating. Moody's current expectations of loss may be 
better than its original expectations because of lower frequency of default 
by the underlying obligors or appreciation in the value of the vehicles 
that secure the obligor's promise of payment. The US job 
market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers of performance. 
Other reasons for better performance than Moody's expected include 
changes in servicing practices to maximize collections on the loans or 
refinancing opportunities that result in a prepayment of the loan.




Down




Levels of credit protection that are insufficient to protect investors 
against current expectations of loss could lead to a downgrade of the 
ratings. Moody's current expectations of loss may be worse 
than its original expectations because of higher frequency of default 
by the underlying obligors of the loans or a deterioration in the value 
of the vehicles that secure the obligor's promise of payment. 
The US job market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers 
of performance. Other reasons for worse performance than Moody's 
expected include poor servicing, error on the part of transaction 
parties, lack of transactional governance and fraud.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors.

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

RATINGS RATIONALE 




The upgrades are a result of the build-up of credit enhancement 
due to sequential pay structures, non-declining overcollateralization, 
and non-declining reserve accounts. The cumulative lifetime 
net losses (CNL) remain unchanged for the 2012 and 2013 transactions, 
as they are performing in line with our previous expectations. 
The CNL expectations range between 0.75% and 1.15% 
for 2011 and 2012 vintage transactions. The CNL on the 2014-A 
transaction was lowered to 1.40% from 1.50%.




Below are key performance metrics (as of the December 2015 distribution 
date) and credit assumptions for each affected transaction. Credit 
assumptions include Moody's expected lifetime CNL expressed as a percentage 
of the original pool balance; Moody's lifetime remaining CNL expectation 
and Moody's Aaa (sf) level expressed as a percentage of the current pool 
balance. The Aaa level is the level of credit enhancement that 
would be consistent with a Aaa (sf) rating for the given asset pool. 
Performance metrics include pool factor, which is the ratio of the 
current collateral balance to the original collateral balance at closing; 
total credit enhancement (expressed as a percentage of the outstanding 
collateral pool balance adjusted for YSOC), which typically consists 
of subordination, overcollateralization, reserve fund, 
Excess Spread per annum and YSOC. The YSOC is a form of soft credit 
enhancement implemented as a compensation for the lower APR on subvened 
loans.

PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGY




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Moody's Global Approach 
to Rating Auto Loan- and Lease-Backed ABS" published in 
December 2015. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating: 





Up




Levels of credit protection that are greater than necessary to protect 
investors against current expectations of loss could lead to an upgrade 
of the rating. Moody's current expectations of loss may be 
better than its original expectations because of lower frequency of default 
by the underlying obligors or appreciation in the value of the vehicles 
that secure the obligor's promise of payment. The US job 
market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers of performance. 
Other reasons for better performance than Moody's expected include 
changes in servicing practices to maximize collections on the loans or 
refinancing opportunities that result in a prepayment of the loan.




Down




Levels of credit protection that are insufficient to protect investors 
against current expectations of loss could lead to a downgrade of the 
ratings. Moody's current expectations of loss may be worse 
than its original expectations because of higher frequency of default 
by the underlying obligors of the loans or a deterioration in the value 
of the vehicles that secure the obligor's promise of payment. 
The US job market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers 
of performance. Other reasons for worse performance than Moody's 
expected include poor servicing, error on the part of transaction 
parties, lack of transactional governance and fraud.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.










Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

RATINGS RATIONALE 




The upgrades on the 2013 and 2014 transactions are a result of the build-up 
of credit enhancement due to sequential pay structures in addition to 
non-declining overcollateralization and reserve accounts. 
The cumulative lifetime net loss (CNL) expectations remain unchanged for 
all outstanding transactions, as they are performing in line with 
our previous projections. The CNL expectations range between 0.75% 
and 0.90% for 2011 and 2012 vintage transactions, 
and 0.90% and 1.50% for the 2013 and 2014 
vintage transactions.




Below are key performance metrics (as of the June 2015 distribution date) 
and credit assumptions for each affected transaction. Credit assumptions 
include Moody's expected lifetime CNL expressed as a percentage of the 
original pool balance; Moody's lifetime remaining CNL expectation 
and Moody's Aaa (sf) level expressed as a percentage of the current pool 
balance. The Aaa level is the level of credit enhancement that 
would be consistent with a Aaa (sf) rating for the given asset pool. 
Performance metrics include pool factor, which is the ratio of the 
current collateral balance to the original collateral balance at closing; 
total credit enhancement, (expressed as a percentage of the outstanding 
collateral pool balance adjusted for YSOC), which typically consists 
of subordination, overcollateralization, reserve fund, 
Excess Spread per annum and YSOC. The YSOC is a form of soft credit 
enhancement implemented as a compensation for the lower APR on subvened 
loans.

PRINCIPAL METHODOLOGY




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Moody's Global Approach 
to Rating Auto Loan- and Lease-Backed ABS" published in 
January 2015. Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating: 





Up




Levels of credit protection that are greater than necessary to protect 
investors against current expectations of loss could lead to an upgrade 
of the rating. Moody's current expectations of loss may be 
better than its original expectations because of lower frequency of default 
by the underlying obligors or appreciation in the value of the vehicles 
that secure the obligor's promise of payment. The US job 
market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers of performance. 
Other reasons for better performance than Moody's expected include 
changes in servicing practices to maximize collections on the loans or 
refinancing opportunities that result in a prepayment of the loan.




Down




Levels of credit protection that are insufficient to protect investors 
against current expectations of loss could lead to a downgrade of the 
ratings. Moody's current expectations of loss may be worse 
than its original expectations because of higher frequency of default 
by the underlying obligors of the loans or a deterioration in the value 
of the vehicles that secure the obligor's promise of payment. 
The US job market and the market for used vehicle are primary drivers 
of performance. Other reasons for worse performance than Moody's 
expected include poor servicing, error on the part of transaction 
parties, lack of transactional governance and fraud.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES 




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios 
that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into 
account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. 
Moody's weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its 
assumptions of the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring. 





For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.




Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.


Please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com 
for additional regulatory disclosures for each credit rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
