            Combining the musical talents of Marty Haugen with those of renowned percussionist Marc Anderson, and several other award-winning Minnesota musicians, One Bright Star shines a new light on traditional Christmas music. This unique collaboration has produced new pieces, including the title track, as well as familiar carols with not-so-familiar instruments and arrangements. From pianolin and Tibetan gongs on "O Come All Ye Faithful," to steel drums on "The Little Drummer Boy," this recording is an instrumental feast for the ears!

            An ecumenical, cross-cultural, and profound call for peace...A deep desire for justice in our world is one of the common themes shared by all people of faith and goodwill. We, the faith-filled, exhort a desire to be heard, understood, and protected by God. We look forward to a day when our world will know a harvest of peace. In the Days to Come, a new recording by Marty Haugen and Marc Anderson, includes Christian, Jewish, Islamic, and Buddhist texts coupled with music from North America, Central America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. It is an interfaith project centered on peacemaking. The title song profoundly and eloquently expresses the desire for peace at the heart of Haugen's message—"On the day when we beat our swords to plowshares, on the day when we throw the spear no more, on the day when all nations will cast their weapons down, on the day when we turn away from war."
