Review
		
Guitarist Richie Hart and his group, which utilizes either keyboardist Pete Levin or organist Dr. Lonnie Smith in the core quartet, performs a variety of superior jazz compositions on this enjoyable and grooving set. The music is primarily straight-ahead, but the solos are generally unpredictable and consistently creative. Of the tunes, it is a pleasure to hear "Frim Fram Sauce" as an instrumental, Ron Carter's catchy "Third Plane" deserves to become a standard, and closing the set with a melodic version of "I'll See You in My Dreams" was an inspired idea. Every selection on this fine outing is worth hearing, with the concise solos uplifting the material. Recommended. ~ Scott Yanow
