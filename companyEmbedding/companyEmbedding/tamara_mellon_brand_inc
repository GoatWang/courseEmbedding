            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

It‚Äôs not cheap or easy to be disruptive, but if you slip up, there might still be money to be had for a second try.

Witness the bankruptcy of Tamara Mellon Brand LLC, which was reported first on WWD.com Wednesday night. The official filings for the reorganization paint a picture of a brand that raised $24 million in 2013, but never produced real top-line traction and still found itself scraping for cash this year.
The company ‚Äî which Jimmy Choo cofounder Tamara Mellon launched with the intent of ‚Äúdisrupting the traditional fashion calendar and supply chain‚Äù with a shop now, wear now strategy ‚Äî plans to pivot with a new venture capital partner and a new, more direct path to the customer.

The company launched with a lot of buzz and a big name at the helm. But a year ago it became plain more financing was needed. Shareholders ‚Äî which included Wilton Place Inc. and TM Holdings One LLC, linked with Ron Perelman‚Äôs MacAndrews & Forbes ‚Äî were given the opportunity to lend money to the brand. Two existing investors and one outside party did put in more money in January with subsequent advances in May, June, September, October and November to fund payroll and pay vendors.
But the company owed roughly $4.1 million to Mellon and other lenders and sought a fresh start.
‚ÄúTMB needs additional funding, however, to accomplish the brand‚Äôs goal of becoming a vertically integrated high fashion e-commerce brand and survive as a viable going concern,‚Äù the firm said in its filings. ‚ÄúDespite its best efforts, TMB has not been able to secure additional funding outside of Chapter 11.‚Äù
That‚Äôs because some investors have not allowed it to raise new capital that would have priority over their interests and no new money was willing to come in subordinate to the existing equity holders, according to the filings.
Thus the prepackaged bankruptcy. The company expects to pay the administrative expenses it owes and many other claims, but the term loan will be paid in cash and preferred stock of the reorganized company. The equity in the existing company will be wiped out.
Mellon was the largest shareholder in the company, holding 52 percent of its common stock as well as preferred shares.
If the reorganization plan is approved by Delaware bankruptcy court, Mellon herself will extend the company $2 million in debtor-in-possession financing for a roughly two-month tour in Chapter 11. The company that emerges will be capitalized with $12 million from New Enterprise Associates 15 LP and other lenders.
New Enterprise will own 31.1 percent of the recapitalized company. The Menlo Park, Calif.-based venture fund already has stakes in myriad companies, including Gilt Groupe, Glamsquad, Groupon, Jet.com and Moda Operandi.
Mellon will own a little more than 16 percent of the new company, plus warrants and options.
The plan to get the company to break even is aggressive, though, and calls for revenues to move from $2.4 million next year to $5.4 million in 2017 and $9.9 million in 2018. To build up those sales, the brand would spend $4.5 million of the $11 million in cash it will have on hand as it re-emerges from bankruptcy.
Tamara Mellon initially launched her own brand with an eye toward selling shoes that would traditionally cost $800 ‚Äî say, the price of a pair of Jimmy Choos¬†‚Äî for $450 by vertically integrating the supply chain. The sales of Tamara Mellon 1.0 came from a mix of tamaramellon.com and high-end online and brick-and-mortar merchants.
Now the emphasis is on going straight to the consumer. Call it the Warby Parker or Bonobos model.
‚ÄúTMB believes that transitioning away from traditional retailers and concentrating on direct sales to customers via both Internet and company-operated stores will maximize TMB‚Äôs goals of shortening the design and manufacturing process, enabling it to deliver to customers the fashion they want to wear, now,‚Äù the company said in a court filing.
Mellon added: ‚ÄúWe will use this brief period of reorganization so we can position ourselves to take advantage of our new growth strategy and ensure the long-term vibrancy of our brand. We expect that we will emerge from this stronger than ever in 60 days or less, and all of us at Tamara Mellon look forward to pursuing our passion long into the future.‚Äù
The designer, who gave her women‚Äôs wear a tribal-Gypsy-warrior woman vibe, is not alone in finding life at their own label tough after powering a runaway success.
Coach Inc.‚Äôs former executive creative director Reed Krakoff also had difficulties with his own high-end brand, which took a broad approach and large initial spending to enter several categories and launch retail. Mellon also went big at launch and tried to start off running.
Designers without the same kind of funding tend to start smaller, build buzz and get known for one strength. The eight-year-old Cushnie et Ochs, for instance, has a reputation for its tight, sexy dresses, but a smaller presence in other categories. Now, with fresh funding from Farol Asset Management and a new chief executive officer in Peter Arnold, the company is going to try to build out its offering.
With a tighter budget this time, Mellon might take a more focused approach for her comeback story. Michael Kors, after all, also went bankrupt out on his own before bouncing back with new financing to become a sales powerhouse ‚Äî and Wall Street darling.

Tamara Mellon on relaunching brand, pay equity


April 4, 2017, 8:42 AM|
On Equal Pay Day, hundreds of small businesses across the country will offer 20 percent discounts, representing the percentage by which women's paychecks are smaller than men's. Tamara Mellon, who's participating in the efforts, joins "CBS This Morning" to discuss filing for bankruptcy in 2016, challenges of co-founding Jimmy Choo as a woman, and equal pay.

Jimmy Choo Co-Founder Tamara Mellon on Launching Her Brand | Fortune.comMPWSearchSearchTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDGovernmentHours After North Korea Missile Launch, Trump Reassigns Homeland Security ChiefTamara Mellon at Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women Summit at the Dorchester Hotel, London. June 12 2017. Pictures by Peter Dench for Fortune Magazine.Most Powerful WomenTamara Mellon on Launching Her Own Brand: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm Trying to Prove That Jimmy Choo Wasn‚Äôt an Accident‚ÄôKate SamuelsonJun 12, 2017Despite all her success, Jimmy Choo co-founder Tamara Mellon still feels a need to prove herself.Speaking Monday at the Dorchester Hotel in London during the Fortune Most Powerful Women International Summit, Mellon said that by creating her own fashion line, she was trying to show "that Jimmy Choo wasn't an accident."Mellon founded the Tamara Mellon Brand in 2013, two years after leaving the luxury shoe company that she co-founded in 1996. Along with Choo, Mellon built the brand into a footwear empire before eventually selling off her stake to luxury goods group Labelux.But when asked what it was like to walk away from the iconic shoe brand in 2011, the 49-year-old said it was the right decision. "It was incredibly difficult, but... I was just burnt out," she told interviewer Pattie Sellers, executive director of Fortune MPW Summits and Live Content . "I mourned it while I was in it... but by the time I left I was ready to go.""I could have stayed for five more years and made a ton more money, but I felt I was selling my soul and I had to be happy within myself," she added.When speaking about her career trajectory, Mellon said that she has been spurred on by "a little bit of fear." "When I was younger, I was motivated by this fire under me," she explained. "It made me think 'Oh my god, where‚Äôs my life going to end up if I don't do something about it?'"Born to an alcoholic mother and a father "overwhelmed" by the domestic situation, Mellon said she knew from a young age that she wanted to make her own money. "I never wanted to be dependent on my father or husband," she told the Summit audience. "I wanted to make my own decisions."The British businesswoman left school without any qualifications and went to straight to work‚Äîa move she thinks has helped with her early success. "By the time I had founded Jimmy Choo, I had a sound knowledge of the industry and working with luxury products from selling on the shop floor," she said.Mellon's advice for those hoping to break into the fashion world is to "just work‚Äîeven if it's not your dream job or exactly what you want to do, because you‚Äôll think of ideas and things will come to you when you‚Äôre being active. It‚Äôs incredibly important just to work."But although the former Vogue accessories editor did not go to college and described herself as "terrible" in school, she does not recommend that her daughter, 15-year-old Minty, do the same."I tell [Minty] that an education is very important," said Mellon. "I'm very proud of her‚Äîshe's pretty much a straight-A student, which I was not like at her age. I always say you have to follow your passion, and if you do then money will follow. Whatever [Minty's] passionate about, I support her."Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers¬© 2017 Time Inc.

Early life[edit]
Mellon was born Tamara Yeardye in London, on 7 July 1967. She is the daughter of Tom Yeardye, a stunt double for Rock Hudson, and Ann (Davis) Yeardye, a former Chanel model.[2] Mellon is the eldest of three siblings. Her current surname stems from the time when she was married to Matthew Mellon, an American businessman and member of the prominent Mellon family.[1]
In 1976, Mellon's family relocated to Beverly Hills, in a home next door to Nancy Sinatra.[2] Mellon alternated between summers in California and the UK. She attended two independent girls' schools in Berkshire‚ÄîBrigidine Convent School[6] and Heathfield St Mary's School‚Äîbefore attending finishing school in Switzerland at the now-defunct Institut Alpin Videmanette.[2]
Career[edit]
Mellon began her career at Phyllis Walters Public Relations, Mirabella, and followed as accessories editor for British Vogue in 1990.
Recognizing the potential for development of high-end designer accessories, Mellon approached bespoke shoe-maker Mr Jimmy Choo with the idea of launching a ready-to-wear shoe company. As co-founder of the Jimmy Choo company, Mellon secured funding from her father for the creation of her business, and sourced factories in Italy. In addition, she set up an office in Italy to handle production, quality control and shipping. By 2001, Jimmy Choo Ltd had over 100 wholesale clients, including Harrods, Harvey Nichols, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman, and the collections accounted for over 50% of the production of several of these factories.
The first Jimmy Choo store, on Motcombe Street in London, was followed by stores in New York, Las Vegas and Beverly Hills. In April 2001, Jimmy Choo Ltd partnered with Equinox Luxury Holdings Ltd. Acquiring Mr Choo‚Äôs share of the ready-to-wear business, Equinox‚Äôs Chief Executive, Robert Bensoussan, became CEO of Jimmy Choo Ltd, introducing handbag and small leather goods collections.
In November 2004, with the company valued at ¬£101 million, Hicks Muse announced the majority acquisition of Jimmy Choo Ltd. The company subsequently opened Jimmy Choo stores in many cities, including London (Sloane Street & New Bond Street), New York City, Beverly Hills, Washington, D.C., Boston, Dallas, Moscow, Milan and Hong Kong, and is distributed by select stores worldwide.
In 2007, Mellon appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List, where she was ranked as the 751st richest person in the UK, with an estimated wealth of ¬£99 million.[7] She was also ranked as the 64th richest woman in Britain.[8]
Business difficulties[edit]
Mellon's shoe and apparel brand filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in December 2015. Section 11 denotes that a business cannot repay its creditors and is entering a re-organisation strategy. The filing states that the company has assets of between $1 million and $10 million and also has between 100 and 199 creditors who are owed between $1 million and $10 million.[9][10] She was forced to file under Section 11 following pressure from angry investors, predicted to lose approximately ¬£2.7 million.[11]
Mellon was subsequently bailed out by American equity firm NEA, with a $10 million cash injection. Mellon is known to have previously criticised the private equity world as ‚Äúruthless opportunists who want to cash in‚Äù.[12][13]
In January 2016, Mellon's former backers filed an objection to the restructuring plans under American bankruptcy protection laws. They stated that these plans allowed her, her fianc√© and a fund to gain control of the new company, leaving former financers with no repayment. The objection includes accusations of mismanagement and abuse of the company, including employing a life coach on the payroll and spending $100,000 on tickets to The Met Gala in New York. The US Department of Justice also filed a formal objection.[14]
Mellon was recently quoted as saying "you can write a guess" in reference to her business plan.[15]
In September 2016, it was revealed that Mellon is suing Jimmy Choo, alleging that the company had blocked her from using luxury shoemakers in Florence, Italy to produce her own line.[16]
Public and political activities[edit]
Mellon is a member of the New Enterprise Council, a group of entrepreneurs who advise the Conservative Party (UK) on policies related to the needs of business.[17]
On 9 November 2010, she was named as a "global trade envoy for Britain" by the British Government. She will have a "roving brief to promote the country‚Äôs booming fashion industry overseas".[18]
Mellon has served on the Board of Directors for Revlon since 2008.[19][20] She is also a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[21]
Honours and awards[edit]
In the 2010 Birthday Honours, Mellon was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to the fashion industry.[22]
On 19 November 2014, Mellon was presented with the Fashion Pioneer Award at the Women‚Äôs Entrepreneurship Day Pioneer Awards, held in New York City at the United Nations.[23]
Personal life[edit]
In 2013, Mellon published the autobiography 'In My Shoes' in which she details her rise to success and her partnership with shoe-designer Jimmy Choo. In an interview about the book with Vanity Fair, she spoke of the challenges of designing shoes for the Oscar Season.[24] Several media publications reported on the discussion in her book about her drug addiction issues, specifically her problems with cocaine. Subsequent news coverage also focused on her stint in rehab, party lifestyle and being fired from Vogue Magazine.[25] Mellon‚Äôs battle with alcohol addiction is also well documented[26] and she met her first husband Matthew at Alcoholics Anonymous. They later divorced and she wrote a number of articles about the dramatic details of her marriage, referencing "snorting her way through alpine ranges of cocaine".[27][15]
In 2015 she announced her engagement to Michael Ovitz in a magazine interview with HELLO![28] It has since been revealed that Ovitz is still married to his first wife Judy.[29] She recently referred to the situation as ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù.[15]

Early life[edit]
Mellon was born Tamara Yeardye in London, on 7 July 1967. She is the daughter of Tom Yeardye, a stunt double for Rock Hudson, and Ann (Davis) Yeardye, a former Chanel model.[2] Mellon is the eldest of three siblings. Her current surname stems from the time when she was married to Matthew Mellon, an American businessman and member of the prominent Mellon family.[1]
In 1976, Mellon's family relocated to Beverly Hills, in a home next door to Nancy Sinatra.[2] Mellon alternated between summers in California and the UK. She attended two independent girls' schools in Berkshire‚ÄîBrigidine Convent School[6] and Heathfield St Mary's School‚Äîbefore attending finishing school in Switzerland at the now-defunct Institut Alpin Videmanette.[2]
Career[edit]
Mellon began her career at Phyllis Walters Public Relations, Mirabella, and followed as accessories editor for British Vogue in 1990.
Recognizing the potential for development of high-end designer accessories, Mellon approached bespoke shoe-maker Mr Jimmy Choo with the idea of launching a ready-to-wear shoe company. As co-founder of the Jimmy Choo company, Mellon secured funding from her father for the creation of her business, and sourced factories in Italy. In addition, she set up an office in Italy to handle production, quality control and shipping. By 2001, Jimmy Choo Ltd had over 100 wholesale clients, including Harrods, Harvey Nichols, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman, and the collections accounted for over 50% of the production of several of these factories.
The first Jimmy Choo store, on Motcombe Street in London, was followed by stores in New York, Las Vegas and Beverly Hills. In April 2001, Jimmy Choo Ltd partnered with Equinox Luxury Holdings Ltd. Acquiring Mr Choo‚Äôs share of the ready-to-wear business, Equinox‚Äôs Chief Executive, Robert Bensoussan, became CEO of Jimmy Choo Ltd, introducing handbag and small leather goods collections.
In November 2004, with the company valued at ¬£101 million, Hicks Muse announced the majority acquisition of Jimmy Choo Ltd. The company subsequently opened Jimmy Choo stores in many cities, including London (Sloane Street & New Bond Street), New York City, Beverly Hills, Washington, D.C., Boston, Dallas, Moscow, Milan and Hong Kong, and is distributed by select stores worldwide.
In 2007, Mellon appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List, where she was ranked as the 751st richest person in the UK, with an estimated wealth of ¬£99 million.[7] She was also ranked as the 64th richest woman in Britain.[8]
Business difficulties[edit]
Mellon's shoe and apparel brand filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in December 2015. Section 11 denotes that a business cannot repay its creditors and is entering a re-organisation strategy. The filing states that the company has assets of between $1 million and $10 million and also has between 100 and 199 creditors who are owed between $1 million and $10 million.[9][10] She was forced to file under Section 11 following pressure from angry investors, predicted to lose approximately ¬£2.7 million.[11]
Mellon was subsequently bailed out by American equity firm NEA, with a $10 million cash injection. Mellon is known to have previously criticised the private equity world as ‚Äúruthless opportunists who want to cash in‚Äù.[12][13]
In January 2016, Mellon's former backers filed an objection to the restructuring plans under American bankruptcy protection laws. They stated that these plans allowed her, her fianc√© and a fund to gain control of the new company, leaving former financers with no repayment. The objection includes accusations of mismanagement and abuse of the company, including employing a life coach on the payroll and spending $100,000 on tickets to The Met Gala in New York. The US Department of Justice also filed a formal objection.[14]
Mellon was recently quoted as saying "you can write a guess" in reference to her business plan.[15]
In September 2016, it was revealed that Mellon is suing Jimmy Choo, alleging that the company had blocked her from using luxury shoemakers in Florence, Italy to produce her own line.[16]
Public and political activities[edit]
Mellon is a member of the New Enterprise Council, a group of entrepreneurs who advise the Conservative Party (UK) on policies related to the needs of business.[17]
On 9 November 2010, she was named as a "global trade envoy for Britain" by the British Government. She will have a "roving brief to promote the country‚Äôs booming fashion industry overseas".[18]
Mellon has served on the Board of Directors for Revlon since 2008.[19][20] She is also a patron of the Elton John AIDS Foundation.[21]
Honours and awards[edit]
In the 2010 Birthday Honours, Mellon was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to the fashion industry.[22]
On 19 November 2014, Mellon was presented with the Fashion Pioneer Award at the Women‚Äôs Entrepreneurship Day Pioneer Awards, held in New York City at the United Nations.[23]
Personal life[edit]
In 2013, Mellon published the autobiography 'In My Shoes' in which she details her rise to success and her partnership with shoe-designer Jimmy Choo. In an interview about the book with Vanity Fair, she spoke of the challenges of designing shoes for the Oscar Season.[24] Several media publications reported on the discussion in her book about her drug addiction issues, specifically her problems with cocaine. Subsequent news coverage also focused on her stint in rehab, party lifestyle and being fired from Vogue Magazine.[25] Mellon‚Äôs battle with alcohol addiction is also well documented[26] and she met her first husband Matthew at Alcoholics Anonymous. They later divorced and she wrote a number of articles about the dramatic details of her marriage, referencing "snorting her way through alpine ranges of cocaine".[27][15]
In 2015 she announced her engagement to Michael Ovitz in a magazine interview with HELLO![28] It has since been revealed that Ovitz is still married to his first wife Judy.[29] She recently referred to the situation as ‚Äúcomplicated‚Äù.[15]

I co-founded Jimmy Choo in 1996 and 20 years later, I'm still obsessed with shoes -- but not the traditional way of doing things.
So I'm starting over.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we‚Äôll set up your first campaign for you for free. We‚Äôll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We‚Äôre here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
