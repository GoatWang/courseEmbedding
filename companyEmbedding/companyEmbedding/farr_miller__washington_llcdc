Fixed Income – Farr, Miller & Washington






































































 















Fixed Income

Fixed income portfolios may be stand-alone or combined with equities in a balanced account. We purchase investment grade municipal bonds, corporate bonds, agency bonds, and treasuries for client portfolios. Each portfolio is customized based on the client’s risk tolerance, income needs, and tax situation.
The investment committee is actively involved in the bond selection process. It performs a macro-economic analysis that leads to the Farr, Miller & Washington “view” on economic growth, interest rates, inflation, etc. which ultimately shapes the duration of the portfolio.
Significant research is performed by our fixed income portfolio managers including yield, spread, and credit analysis. The U.S. municipal bond market is comprised of thousands of issuers and tens of thousands of individual securities. Farr, Miller & Washington employs a sophisticated screening process that highlights bonds and creates a manageable and select list of potential bond investments.
We believe fixed income securities should act as an anchor for your overall portfolio. We do not believe in taking excess risk to earn a little more yield in the bond market.
For more information about Fixed Income, please call us at 800-390-3277, email us at invest@farrmiller.com, or use the form below.
Please be advised there is a minimum account requirement for management by Farr, Miller & Washington.

Growth and Income – Farr, Miller & Washington






































































 















Growth and Income

The Growth and Income portfolio’s investment objective is to provide current income and capital appreciation through long-term investments.
The portfolio typically invests the majority of its assets in dividend paying common stocks and real estate investment trusts (REITs). The portfolio may also invest in preferred stock, foreign common stocks/ADRs, corporate bonds and government Treasury bonds. With regard to our investments in corporate securities, our investment universe consists of companies with total market capitalization greater than $1 billion.
Our research analysts employ fundamental, bottom-up research to select companies believed to have good prospects for income generation and/or capital appreciation over a three-to five-year period. For dividend paying stocks, significant attention will be paid to competitive advantages, balance sheet strength, free cash flow, and dividend coverage. For those companies that do not pay dividends but have the potential for stock price appreciation, we focus on secular growth drivers, competitive advantages, and absolute and relative valuation.
The investment committee will use best efforts to minimize short- and long-term capital gains taxes. The portfolio seeks to reduce risk by diversifying among multiple companies and industries.
For more information about the Growth and Income product, please call us at 800-390-3277, email us at invest@farrmiller.com, or use the form below.
Please be advised there is a minimum account requirement for management by Farr, Miller & Washington

Small / Mid Cap Core (Smid) Equity – Farr, Miller & Washington






































































 















Small / Mid Cap Core (Smid) Equity

This portfolio consists of 30 to 40 small to mid-sized companies with a history of consistent profits, high returns on capital, strong balance sheets, and low reinvestment requirements that trade at reasonable valuations. Stocks in this portfolio have market capitalizations greater than $100 million.
The portfolio is managed by a four person investment committee and employs a buy-to-hold philosophy. The portfolio has a long-term focus and seeks appreciation of capital through long-term investments in companies with high quality, consistent and sustainable growth when they are trading at a discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.
Like the Large Cap Equity Portfolio, our analysts use bottom-up fundamental analysis to identify companies with strong management teams, conservative balance sheets, solid returns on capital, and growing free cash flow.
The goal of this portfolio is to provide clients an opportunity to participate in a higher growth area of the stock market and be part of an overall portfolio designed to help clients meet their long-term investment and financial goals.
For more information about the Small/Mid Cap Core Equity product, please call us at 800-390-3277, email us at invest@farrmiller.com, or use the form below.
Please be advised there is a minimum account requirement for management by Farr, Miller & Washington.
