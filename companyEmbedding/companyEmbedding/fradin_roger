				Roger Fradin			

SSI Hall Of Fame: 2008

March 09, 2008


						Scott Goldfine					

 
 



Current Status 
President/CEO for Honeywell Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) 
 Why He’s On The List 

Founded ADI, which has grown to a more than $2 billion global wholesale distributor of security and low-voltage products, with more than 200 branch locations worldwide
Helped launch Vista control — the genesis of highly reliable and cost-effective wireless technology
Started First Alert Professional, the industry’s leading branded dealer network that now includes more than 300 independent dealers with in excess of 600 locations
In 1986, introduced AlarmNet, which set a standard as a reliable alternative for alarm signal transmission
Demonstrated commitment to supporting independent alarm dealers with divesture of Honeywell Security Monitoring (HSM)
Instrumental in key acquisitions (e.g. Northern Computers, providing foundation of Honeywell’s access business)
Under his leadership, ACS has tripled its new product innovation and grown by $6 billion
 Keys To Success 
“I’m fortunate to have led a number of great business ventures and accomplishments over my career with Ademco, Pittway and Honeywell. The key has been surrounding myself with great people. It spans from the day when we convinced Ben Cornett and his team to join Ademco to my current leadership team.” 
 How Things Have Changed
“Ademco and Pittway had a very strong entrepreneurial culture, which has been a major factor in the transformational change within ACS and Honeywell. At the time we sold our business to Honeywell, it was a company of three cultures — Honeywell, Allied Signal and Pittway. A major transformation has taken place since those days. One of our hallmarks today is blending the best of a big company’s strengths and those of a small company culture.
“Looking at the entire industry, the global nature has changed in that our business wasn’t historically based on growth outside of the U.S. It is now. More specifically, there is major expansion in critical infrastructure as ports, aviation, chemicals, oil and gas, nuclear, government, food- and water-related facilities. And, cyber security has been another massive shift over the course of my career, from the threats that exist for business around the world to the convergence of IT and physical security.” 
 What The Future Holds
“There will be a greater use of wireless technology. I also see it becoming a larger part of commercial and industrial applications, while today it’s mostly used in residential. Also, the convergence of IT and physical security — will continue. There will be a convergence that can bring higher security to both physical assets and data, and improved ROI on IT and security infrastructure investments.” 
 Something People Might Not Know
If his career had taken a different path, he might have wound up as a consultant or investment banker. 
 Reaction To Being Inducted
“This is a tremendous honor. I want to thank SSI magazine. The security industry is a great business. I’ve had wonderful experiences, great relationships and gained many friends from a terrific career that’s just getting started!”

Honeywell Names Roger Fradin President and CEO Automation and Control Solutions | Business Wire


























































Honeywell Names Roger Fradin President and CEO Automation and Control Solutions






January 05, 2004 12:01 PM Eastern Standard Time



				MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 5, 2004--Honeywell (NYSE: HON) announced today that Roger Fradin has been named President and CEO of its $7 billion Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) business. Fradin will report to Chairman and CEO Dave Cote and become an Executive Officer of the company. He succeeds Kevin Gilligan, who resigned from Honeywell to pursue leadership opportunities outside the company.  "Roger is superbly qualified and his track record of success in leading several ACS enterprises puts him in terrific position to drive growth across our entire portfolio of automation and control businesses," said Cote. "Roger will undoubtedly bring a strong focus on growth and performance to a business group that is already well positioned in industries with growing demand for its products and services, which provide comfort, safety, security, and productivity to customers around the world. When I joined Honeywell two years ago, Kevin agreed to remain as leader of ACS for a period of time to instill a renewed focus on growth and performance, and to identify his successor and work toward an orderly transition. As a result of Kevin's efforts, Roger is well-prepared to lead ACS, and he will build on a solid foundation. I would like to thank Kevin for his strong leadership during his 26 years with the company and wish him much success in the future." 

 Most recently, Fradin served as President of Automation and Control Products (ACP), a diverse business unit that encompassed Honeywell's Sensing and Control; Security; Fire; and Environmental and Combustion Controls enterprises. Previously, Fradin was President of Honeywell's Security and Fire Solutions enterprise, a title he held since February 2000, when he joined Honeywell following the acquisition of the Pittway Corporation. Fradin first joined the former Pittway business in 1976 and served as President of ADEMCO from 1985 to 2000.  Fradin earned his B.S. in economics, summa cum laude, and his M.B.A. from The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.  In a realignment of the ACS management structure intended to eliminate redundancy and increase focus on growth, the leaders of the ACP businesses - Sensing and Control; Honeywell Security; Honeywell Fire; and Environmental and Combustion Controls - will report to Fradin along with the leaders of Honeywell Building Solutions Americas, Honeywell Building Solutions EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), Honeywell Process Solutions, and ACS Asia Pacific. Fradin will be based in Minneapolis.  Honeywell International is a $22 billion diversified technology and manufacturing leader, serving customers worldwide with aerospace products and services; control technologies for buildings, homes and industry; automotive products; turbochargers; specialty chemicals; fibers; and electronic and advanced materials.
