Wound Management











									















Helping Patients Heal
  								
   								




Our focus is to make patients better. Our products have been clinically evaluated and shown to facilitate healing in the hospital or the home. Acelity has developed a comprehensive range of products and therapies for a wide variety of wounds.









			















The Science Behind Our Products

		




	Our solutions are built on deep scientific expertise, supported by a large body of clinical evidence.

Clinical Evidence

                
            

























            	               						















Why It Matters
  								           	               							                    		
					                    		





Chronic wounds represent a large and growing threat to public health. In the US alone, they affect over 6.5 million people. As the population ages, that burden will increase – made worse by rising healthcare costs and the growing incidences of diabetes and obesity.1


			 

At Acelity, we help improve the lives of patients through innovation. We are also researching and documenting the value of our products in terms of individual and public benefit. This research helps to inform policy- and decision-makers by providing a systematic way to evaluate different treatments.



	 





































	            















Diabetic Foot Ulcers 

	        





Every 30 seconds a leg is amputated globally due to diabetes. For patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, the lifetime risk of developing a foot ulcer may be as high as 25%. Of this, 15% of diabetic foot ulcers progress to amputation, accounting for 80% of non-traumatic amputations.2

Pressure Ulcers 

	        





		A pressure ulcer (also known as a bed sore, pressure sore, or decubitus ulcer) is a localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue, which may be caused by unrelieved pressure on the skin. 

		 

		These pressure induced skin injuries range from non blanchable erythema of intact skin to deep ulcers extending to the bone, where ulceration may be determined by the degree and duration of pressure and may be characterized by deep tissue necrosis. It usually occurs over a bony prominence as a result of pressure, shear or friction. Acelity offers a comprehensive range of products for the management of pressure ulcers.

Venous Leg Ulcers

	        





		Venous ulcers are most commonly found below the knee and above the ankle and often have a larger surface area but are shallower in depth than other ulcers. The leg may become swollen, causing the skin surrounding the ulcer to become dry, itchy and sometimes brownish in color.

Acute & Traumatic Wounds 

	        





		Acute wounds are disruptions to the integrity of the skin and underlying tissues that, with proper care and control, heal in a timely and uneventful manner. Traumatic wounds result from injury to hard and/or soft tissue and include damage to bone, muscle, ligament and tendons, including partial thickness burns and orthopedic wounds.

Enteric Fistulas

	        





		Fistulas are an abnormal connection between two or more structures or spaces. Fistulas are usually the result of injury or surgery, but also can result from infection or inflammation. Managing patients with fistulas is challenging and represents a significant unmet need.

		Acelity is a leading global medical technology company committed to restoring people’s lives through the development and commercialization of advanced wound care. Acelity L.P. Inc. and its subsidiaries leverage the strengths of Kinetic Concepts, Inc. and Systagenix Wound Management, Limited. Our mission is to change the clinical practice of medicine with solutions that speed healing, reduce complications, create economic value and improve patients’ lives.

		 

		We are global pioneers in advanced wound care, creating and growing new markets based on our ability to identify and address unmet clinical needs with products that advance the practice of medicine, beginning with our introduction of groundbreaking negative pressure wound therapy, or NPWT, more than 20 years ago. Available in more than 90 countries, we offer a broad range of products that can be used across clinical applications, care settings and clinician groups to improve clinical outcomes and reduce overall costs of care. Our product offerings are backed by an extensive body of scientific, clinical and economic outcomes data that demonstrate their clinical efficacy and value proposition. By offering a range of complementary solutions that are often used together or in sequence across multiple care settings, we are able to address patients’ needs throughout the healing process and offer healthcare providers a single source to address them. We have maintained our market leadership by capitalizing on our differentiated and best-in-class product offerings, utilizing our highly trained sales force, robust service infrastructure and strong clinical reputation.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $     million
from the sale of            shares of our common stock in this offering,
assuming an initial public offering price of $     per share, which is the
mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their
option to purchase additional shares, the net proceeds to us will be
approximately $     million, assuming an initial public offering price of $    
per share, which is the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page
of this prospectus, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with the net
proceeds from our borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
the issuance of the New Senior Notes, to (A) repay all amounts outstanding under
our existing senior secured credit facilities and pay accrued interest,
applicable premiums and related fees and expenses; and (B) redeem all
outstanding aggregate principal amounts of the Second Lien Notes and the
Unsecured Notes and pay accrued interest, applicable premiums and related fees
and expenses.

As of June 30, 2015, there was (A) $1,892.5 million (net of $25.0 million
discount, net of accretion) of Senior Dollar Term E-1 Credit Facility due May 4,
2018, or the Dollar Term E-1 Loans, outstanding, (B) $262.4 million (net of $6.4
million, net of accretion) of Senior Euro Term E-1 Credit Facility due May 4,
2018, or the Euro Term E-1 Loans, outstanding, (C) $311.0 million (net of $2.8
million, net of accretion) of Senior Term E-2 Credit Facility due November 4,
2016, or the Term E-2 Loans, outstanding, (D) $30.0 million of revolving credit
loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility maturing in November 4,
2016, or the Revolving Credit Facility, (E) $1,732.0 million outstanding
aggregate principal amount (net of discount of $18.0 million, net of accretion)
of the Second Lien Notes maturing on November 1, 2018 and (F) $609.6 million
outstanding aggregate principal amount (net of discount of $2.4 million, net of
accretion) of the Unsecured Notes maturing on November 1, 2019. The $30.0
million borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility was repaid in July 2015
using cash from operations.

Borrowings under (i) Dollar Term E-1 Loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at
our election, a Eurocurrency rate plus 3.50% or an adjusted base rate plus
2.50%, (ii) Euro Term E-1 Loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at our
election, a Eurocurrency rate plus 3.75% or an adjusted base rate plus 2.75%,
and (iii) Term E-2 Loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at our election, a
Eurocurrency rate plus 3.00% or an adjusted base rate plus 2.00%. As of June 30,
2015, Dollar Term E-1 Loans, Euro Term E-1 Loans and Term E-2 Loans had the
effective interest rates of 5.00%, 5.67% and 4.69%, respectively. Interest on
the Second Lien Notes accrues at the rate of 10.5% per annum and interest on the
Unsecured Notes accrues at the rate of 12.5% per annum. For a further
description of our existing indebtedness being refinanced, repaid and/or
redeemed.

An increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares from the expected number of shares to
be sold by us in this offering, assuming no change in the assumed initial
offering price per share, which is the mid-point of the price range set forth on
the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) our net proceeds
from this offering by $     million. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed
initial offering price of $     per share, based on the mid-point of the price
range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease)
the net proceeds to us from this offering by $     million, assuming the number
of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,
remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.


Our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize
will be, subject to intense competition. We believe that the principal
competitive factors in our markets are: 

• quality, reliability and ease of use;

• price; 

• differentiated product features that deliver superior clinical outcomes and 
  economic value; 

• clinical support and education for customers on product use and clinical
  practice; 

• innovation capabilities to bring new products to market that meet customer
  needs;

• dedicated, around-the-clock customer service for technical, clinical and
  reimbursement support; and 

• deep-rooted relationships with customers and buyers.

Our AWT products compete with various commercially available negative pressure
therapy products as well as other traditional modalities in wound care. Key
competitors to our AWT business include 3M Health Care Ltd., Cardinal Health,
Inc., Coloplast Corp, ConvaTec Inc., MiMedx Group Inc., Mölnlycke Health Care,
Organogenesis Inc., Smith & Nephew plc. and The Hartmann Group. In addition,
there are several smaller regional companies that have introduced medical
devices designed to compete with our AWT products.

Our Regenerative Medicine products compete with various commercially available
products made from synthetic materials or biologic materials of human or animal
tissue origin. Our tissue matrix products compete with products marketed by such
companies as Allergan plc, Atrium Medical Corporation, Baxter International
Inc., Cook Inc., Covidien plc, C.R. Bard Inc., Johnson & Johnson, TEI
Biosciences Inc., and W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc. In addition, there are
several smaller companies that have introduced synthetic or biologic materials
designed to compete with our Regenerative Medicine products.

We also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific,
management and sales personnel, as well as to acquire technologies and
technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our
business.

We are aware of several companies that compete or are developing technologies in
our current and future product areas. As a result, we expect competition to
remain intense. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability
to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner,
receive adequate coverage and reimbursement, are cost effective and are safe and
effective.


Company Description
Acelity is a leading global medical technology company committed to the
development and commercialization of advanced wound care and regenerative
medicine solutions. Acelity was formed by uniting the strengths of three
organizations, KCI, Systagenix and LifeCell, into our two business


 segments:
Advanced Wound Therapeutics and Regenerative Medicine. Our mission is to change
the clinical practice of medicine with solutions that speed healing, reduce
complications, create economic value and improve patients’ lives.

We are global pioneers in advanced wound care and soft tissue repair, creating
and growing new markets based on our ability to identify and address unmet
clinical needs with products that advance the practice of medicine, beginning
with our introduction of groundbreaking negative pressure wound therapy, or
NPWT, and acellular tissue matrices nearly 20 years ago. We offer a broad range
of products that can be used across clinical applications, care settings and
clinician groups to accelerate soft tissue healing, improve clinical outcomes
and reduce overall costs of care. Our product offerings are backed by an
extensive body of scientific, clinical and economic outcomes data that
demonstrate the clinical efficacy and value proposition of our products. By
offering a range of complementary solutions that are often used together or in
sequence across multiple care settings, we are able to address patients’ needs
throughout the healing process and offer healthcare providers a single source
for addressing such needs. We have maintained our market leadership by
capitalizing on our differentiated and best-in-class product offerings,
utilizing our highly trained sales force, robust service infrastructure and
strong clinical reputation.

Our Advanced Wound Therapeutics, or AWT, business is focused on the development
and commercialization of advanced devices and advanced wound dressings. Our
advanced devices business is primarily engaged in marketing several technology
platforms, including NPWT, surgical and incision management and epidermal
grafting. For patients suffering from traumatic, surgical or chronic wounds,
such as diabetic foot ulcers, our NPWT devices facilitate accelerated healing
that was unattainable prior to the introduction of NPWT. Our advanced wound
dressings business markets wound dressing technologies for the purpose of
managing chronic and acute wounds. Our advanced wound dressings are designed to
maintain a moist wound environment, while managing exudate, to promote healing
and to protect the wound site from infection. Our AWT business is primarily
conducted by KCI and its operating subsidiaries, including Systagenix.

Our Regenerative Medicine business is primarily focused on the development and
commercialization of regenerative and reconstructive acellular tissue matrices
for use in general and reconstructive surgical procedures to reinforce soft
tissue defects. We offer tissue matrices for a variety of reconstructive
procedures, including post-mastectomy breast reconstruction and the
reinforcement of abdominal wall defects. Our tissue matrices are engineered to
encourage rapid tissue incorporation, reducing morbidity for patients, while
providing optimal reconstructive outcomes. In addition to our acellular tissue
matrices, our Regenerative Medicine business markets complementary autologous
fat grafting solutions for reconstructive and aesthetic applications. Our
Regenerative Medicine business is primarily conducted by LifeCell and its
operating subsidiaries.

We are a global company with approximately 29% of our 2014 revenues generated
outside the United States, and our products are available in more than 75
countries. We have invested in direct sales and marketing channels and
distributors in order to expand our presence in these markets to meet the needs
of our customers and payers across clinical applications, care settings and 
clinician groups. A critical component of marketing our portfolio of solutions 
and services is our sales organization of approximately 1,800 professionals 
working across multiple care settings and specialties, of which approximately 
1,000 are based in the United States. This sales infrastructure enables us to 
market our products directly with trained medical professionals in specific care
settings in the United States, Canada, Western Europe and key emerging markets.
We have succeeded in establishing strong relationships globally with key 
constituencies, including hospitals, post-acute facilities, group purchasing 
organizations, or GPOs, payers and other key clinical and economic decision 
makers by offering comprehensive customer service and clinical education.

Why It Matters
  								           	               							                    		
					                    		





Chronic wounds represent a large and growing threat to public health. In the US alone, they affect over 6.5 million people. As the population ages, that burden will increase – made worse by rising healthcare costs and the growing incidences of diabetes and obesity.1


			 

At Acelity, we help improve the lives of patients through innovation. We are also researching and documenting the value of our products in terms of individual and public benefit. This research helps to inform policy- and decision-makers by providing a systematic way to evaluate different treatments.



	 





































	            















Diabetic Foot Ulcers 

	        





Every 30 seconds a leg is amputated globally due to diabetes. For patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, the lifetime risk of developing a foot ulcer may be as high as 25%. Of this, 15% of diabetic foot ulcers progress to amputation, accounting for 80% of non-traumatic amputations.2

Pressure Ulcers 

	        





		A pressure ulcer (also known as a bed sore, pressure sore, or decubitus ulcer) is a localized injury to the skin and/or underlying tissue, which may be caused by unrelieved pressure on the skin. 

		 

		These pressure induced skin injuries range from non blanchable erythema of intact skin to deep ulcers extending to the bone, where ulceration may be determined by the degree and duration of pressure and may be characterized by deep tissue necrosis. It usually occurs over a bony prominence as a result of pressure, shear or friction. Acelity offers a comprehensive range of products for the management of pressure ulcers.

Venous Leg Ulcers

	        





		Venous ulcers are most commonly found below the knee and above the ankle and often have a larger surface area but are shallower in depth than other ulcers. The leg may become swollen, causing the skin surrounding the ulcer to become dry, itchy and sometimes brownish in color.

Acute & Traumatic Wounds 

	        





		Acute wounds are disruptions to the integrity of the skin and underlying tissues that, with proper care and control, heal in a timely and uneventful manner. Traumatic wounds result from injury to hard and/or soft tissue and include damage to bone, muscle, ligament and tendons, including partial thickness burns and orthopedic wounds.

Enteric Fistulas

	        





		Fistulas are an abnormal connection between two or more structures or spaces. Fistulas are usually the result of injury or surgery, but also can result from infection or inflammation. Managing patients with fistulas is challenging and represents a significant unmet need.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $     million
from the sale of            shares of our common stock in this offering,
assuming an initial public offering price of $     per share, which is the
mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their
option to purchase additional shares, the net proceeds to us will be
approximately $     million, assuming an initial public offering price of $    
per share, which is the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page
of this prospectus, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with the net
proceeds from our borrowings under the New Senior Secured Credit Facilities and
the issuance of the New Senior Notes, to (A) repay all amounts outstanding under
our existing senior secured credit facilities and pay accrued interest,
applicable premiums and related fees and expenses; and (B) redeem all
outstanding aggregate principal amounts of the Second Lien Notes and the
Unsecured Notes and pay accrued interest, applicable premiums and related fees
and expenses.

As of June 30, 2015, there was (A) $1,892.5 million (net of $25.0 million
discount, net of accretion) of Senior Dollar Term E-1 Credit Facility due May 4,
2018, or the Dollar Term E-1 Loans, outstanding, (B) $262.4 million (net of $6.4
million, net of accretion) of Senior Euro Term E-1 Credit Facility due May 4,
2018, or the Euro Term E-1 Loans, outstanding, (C) $311.0 million (net of $2.8
million, net of accretion) of Senior Term E-2 Credit Facility due November 4,
2016, or the Term E-2 Loans, outstanding, (D) $30.0 million of revolving credit
loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility maturing in November 4,
2016, or the Revolving Credit Facility, (E) $1,732.0 million outstanding
aggregate principal amount (net of discount of $18.0 million, net of accretion)
of the Second Lien Notes maturing on November 1, 2018 and (F) $609.6 million
outstanding aggregate principal amount (net of discount of $2.4 million, net of
accretion) of the Unsecured Notes maturing on November 1, 2019. The $30.0
million borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility was repaid in July 2015
using cash from operations.

Borrowings under (i) Dollar Term E-1 Loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at
our election, a Eurocurrency rate plus 3.50% or an adjusted base rate plus
2.50%, (ii) Euro Term E-1 Loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at our
election, a Eurocurrency rate plus 3.75% or an adjusted base rate plus 2.75%,
and (iii) Term E-2 Loans bear interest at a rate equal to, at our election, a
Eurocurrency rate plus 3.00% or an adjusted base rate plus 2.00%. As of June 30,
2015, Dollar Term E-1 Loans, Euro Term E-1 Loans and Term E-2 Loans had the
effective interest rates of 5.00%, 5.67% and 4.69%, respectively. Interest on
the Second Lien Notes accrues at the rate of 10.5% per annum and interest on the
Unsecured Notes accrues at the rate of 12.5% per annum. For a further
description of our existing indebtedness being refinanced, repaid and/or
redeemed.

An increase (decrease) of 1,000,000 shares from the expected number of shares to
be sold by us in this offering, assuming no change in the assumed initial
offering price per share, which is the mid-point of the price range set forth on
the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) our net proceeds
from this offering by $     million. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed
initial offering price of $     per share, based on the mid-point of the price
range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (decrease)
the net proceeds to us from this offering by $     million, assuming the number
of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,
remains the same and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.


Our currently marketed products are, and any future products we commercialize
will be, subject to intense competition. We believe that the principal
competitive factors in our markets are: 

• quality, reliability and ease of use;

• price; 

• differentiated product features that deliver superior clinical outcomes and 
  economic value; 

• clinical support and education for customers on product use and clinical
  practice; 

• innovation capabilities to bring new products to market that meet customer
  needs;

• dedicated, around-the-clock customer service for technical, clinical and
  reimbursement support; and 

• deep-rooted relationships with customers and buyers.

Our AWT products compete with various commercially available negative pressure
therapy products as well as other traditional modalities in wound care. Key
competitors to our AWT business include 3M Health Care Ltd., Cardinal Health,
Inc., Coloplast Corp, ConvaTec Inc., MiMedx Group Inc., Mölnlycke Health Care,
Organogenesis Inc., Smith & Nephew plc. and The Hartmann Group. In addition,
there are several smaller regional companies that have introduced medical
devices designed to compete with our AWT products.

Our Regenerative Medicine products compete with various commercially available
products made from synthetic materials or biologic materials of human or animal
tissue origin. Our tissue matrix products compete with products marketed by such
companies as Allergan plc, Atrium Medical Corporation, Baxter International
Inc., Cook Inc., Covidien plc, C.R. Bard Inc., Johnson & Johnson, TEI
Biosciences Inc., and W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc. In addition, there are
several smaller companies that have introduced synthetic or biologic materials
designed to compete with our Regenerative Medicine products.

We also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific,
management and sales personnel, as well as to acquire technologies and
technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our
business.

We are aware of several companies that compete or are developing technologies in
our current and future product areas. As a result, we expect competition to
remain intense. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability
to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner,
receive adequate coverage and reimbursement, are cost effective and are safe and
effective.


Company Description
Acelity is a leading global medical technology company committed to the
development and commercialization of advanced wound care and regenerative
medicine solutions. Acelity was formed by uniting the strengths of three
organizations, KCI, Systagenix and LifeCell, into our two business


 segments:
Advanced Wound Therapeutics and Regenerative Medicine. Our mission is to change
the clinical practice of medicine with solutions that speed healing, reduce
complications, create economic value and improve patients’ lives.

We are global pioneers in advanced wound care and soft tissue repair, creating
and growing new markets based on our ability to identify and address unmet
clinical needs with products that advance the practice of medicine, beginning
with our introduction of groundbreaking negative pressure wound therapy, or
NPWT, and acellular tissue matrices nearly 20 years ago. We offer a broad range
of products that can be used across clinical applications, care settings and
clinician groups to accelerate soft tissue healing, improve clinical outcomes
and reduce overall costs of care. Our product offerings are backed by an
extensive body of scientific, clinical and economic outcomes data that
demonstrate the clinical efficacy and value proposition of our products. By
offering a range of complementary solutions that are often used together or in
sequence across multiple care settings, we are able to address patients’ needs
throughout the healing process and offer healthcare providers a single source
for addressing such needs. We have maintained our market leadership by
capitalizing on our differentiated and best-in-class product offerings,
utilizing our highly trained sales force, robust service infrastructure and
strong clinical reputation.

Our Advanced Wound Therapeutics, or AWT, business is focused on the development
and commercialization of advanced devices and advanced wound dressings. Our
advanced devices business is primarily engaged in marketing several technology
platforms, including NPWT, surgical and incision management and epidermal
grafting. For patients suffering from traumatic, surgical or chronic wounds,
such as diabetic foot ulcers, our NPWT devices facilitate accelerated healing
that was unattainable prior to the introduction of NPWT. Our advanced wound
dressings business markets wound dressing technologies for the purpose of
managing chronic and acute wounds. Our advanced wound dressings are designed to
maintain a moist wound environment, while managing exudate, to promote healing
and to protect the wound site from infection. Our AWT business is primarily
conducted by KCI and its operating subsidiaries, including Systagenix.

Our Regenerative Medicine business is primarily focused on the development and
commercialization of regenerative and reconstructive acellular tissue matrices
for use in general and reconstructive surgical procedures to reinforce soft
tissue defects. We offer tissue matrices for a variety of reconstructive
procedures, including post-mastectomy breast reconstruction and the
reinforcement of abdominal wall defects. Our tissue matrices are engineered to
encourage rapid tissue incorporation, reducing morbidity for patients, while
providing optimal reconstructive outcomes. In addition to our acellular tissue
matrices, our Regenerative Medicine business markets complementary autologous
fat grafting solutions for reconstructive and aesthetic applications. Our
Regenerative Medicine business is primarily conducted by LifeCell and its
operating subsidiaries.

We are a global company with approximately 29% of our 2014 revenues generated
outside the United States, and our products are available in more than 75
countries. We have invested in direct sales and marketing channels and
distributors in order to expand our presence in these markets to meet the needs
of our customers and payers across clinical applications, care settings and 
clinician groups. A critical component of marketing our portfolio of solutions 
and services is our sales organization of approximately 1,800 professionals 
working across multiple care settings and specialties, of which approximately 
1,000 are based in the United States. This sales infrastructure enables us to 
market our products directly with trained medical professionals in specific care
settings in the United States, Canada, Western Europe and key emerging markets.
We have succeeded in establishing strong relationships globally with key 
constituencies, including hospitals, post-acute facilities, group purchasing 
organizations, or GPOs, payers and other key clinical and economic decision 
makers by offering comprehensive customer service and clinical education.

The San Antonio, Texas-based company, which develops regenerative medicine and sells health care products in 75 countries, filed for an initial public offering in August. The company is a portfolio company of private equity firm Apax Partners, Canadian pension investment manager PSP Investments and the Canada Pension Plan Board. Acelity was founded in 1976 as Kinetic Concepts Inc (KCI). KCI acquired LifeCell Corp for $1.7 billion in 2008 and bought UK-based Systagenix, formerly a part of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), for $485 million in 2013. KCI renamed itself as Acelity after the Systagenix takeover. The company was leveraged at 6.74x at June 30, and plans to use the IPO to repay its debt, Thomson Reuters IFR reported in August. Acelity intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange, but has yet to decide on a ticker symbol. The company has not revealed the number of shares it will be offering or their expected price. The company, which generated $1.86 billion in revenue last year, sells and rents its negative pressure wound therapy systems for use in surgical procedures such as post-mastectomy breast reconstruction and abdominal wall reconstructions. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are the top-line bookrunners, while Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Credit Suisse, RBC Capital Markets and UBS are joint bookrunners.
