Strategic Alliances
Value Added Partnerships
University Collaboration
Contact Us

We recognize that the core material designation only begins the development foundation for a new or replacement product. As such, with a continued focus on partnership and understanding of project time considerations, we work closely with leading secondary operations groups so as to offer either recommendations or full project management services to our customers. These alliances, which continue to grow, are driven by the key competencies and best in class philosophies of our alliance partners who stand ready with us to assist in full support of the medical device community. For more information regarding this topic please contact: Sales@advbiomaterials.com   

At the core of our business model is the philosophy of value added partnerships, wherein our customers’ R&D development initiatives or optimized material processability are collaboratively outlined and achieved with a team of our own technical and applicational experts.  We continue to leverage our biomaterials technology and capabilities through these partnerships by offering full product customization, tailored mechanical specifications and full project management support. For more information regarding this topic please contact: Sales@advbiomaterials.com    

We actively engage university research centers to share in collaborative development initiatives. Utilizing our expertise in polymer synthesis, material know-how and manufacturing processes coupled with university innovation and solution-driven projects, our goal is to continue expanding the use and functionality of our core polymer technology.For more information regarding this topic please contact: Sales@advbiomaterials.com  

For more information on developing a partnership with ASB, please contact us at Sales@advbiomaterials.com Please include your area of interest; University Collaboration, Strategic Alliance or Value Added partnerships in your e-mail.   We look forward to working with you!
