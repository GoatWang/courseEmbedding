SHARMAPain Management Specialist / Physical Therapist3 reviewsRatings for Dr. David I. Stein 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 2KnowledgeMy wife to has had many problems with this doctor but more so his staff. She is on medicaid and they still collect a 70.00 money order from her and every other patient they have. He prescribes medicine that they no longer carry at any pharmacy and when you call the office about it, they are rude and over talk you, not giving you the chance to explain anything. My wife has now been hospitalized due to seizures cause by all of the problems there. Which I will get into once we file suit. If anyone is looking to file suit in a class action as well as filing complaints with the medical board and other things.Please feel free to contact us at buddabear38@yahoo.com and or 414-235-5090. Thanks KenWas this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted May 16, 2017 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeBait and switch worthless treatments at four times implied costs - a legalized scam bilking us tens of thousands!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted February 11, 2017 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeI was referred to this doctor by a pain management clinic because of financial reasons. I was very excited to see dr. Stein but that quickly faded. Upon my first visit, he spent it all of three minutes with me. I have had two previous low back surgeries and was facing a third one. He didn't seem to care about my records, my history, or my concerns at the present time. He was rude and obnoxious! And that is an understatement! I was required to take a urine screening subsequent of my first two visits. When I went to see dr. Stein on my third visit he informed me that my urine screening came up negative for all drugs, including the ones he was prescribing me. It was impossible! He refused to talk to me about it and made me leave the clinic with a discharge notice. I was very confused so I called shortly after I left and spoke to a woman at the front desk. She informed me that she would not give me a copy of my medical records and then hung up on me! Something very shady is going on at this Clinic! They take your money, the doctor spends less than 30 seconds with you, Andrea Lee could not care less about how you're actually doing. Upon my first visit, I asked if we could discuss other options that would deter me from taking pain medication for my entire life and he said, since I was a post-surgical patient he could keep me on drugs with no problem. That is the exact opposite of what I wanted and I made that very clear! He did not care whatsoever! I am currently trying to get my medical records from them but they are dragging their feet because in my opinion, I believe they are doing many things that are against the law. He is by far the worst pain management doctor on the planet! Please beware when considering going to this doctor.
Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted November 30, 2016 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeMilwaukee Pain Treatment tells you preliminary treatments are required before the advertised miracle disc decompression(bate and switch), but won't disclose costs(also a Wisconsin statute). Then you receive horrendous bills twice that of other pain clinics, over $10,000 for a temporary cortisone shot, and a 20 minute nerve ablation which, if you can find the fine print, has little effectiveness and also temporary. Fighting them in court, court commissioners and judges side with Milwaukee Pain, which files over 50 judgment cases/year and 300+ in the last five - you are treated like the criminal.

GC. Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted January 5, 2016 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeI am an RN and my husband was seeing Dr. Stein. All I know is that their billing is horrible. Evidently, they charge over a thousand dollars every month for a urine drug screen that they do in minutes in their office. That is absolutely ridiculous!!! Then, your bill will jump from one hundred and fifty dollars to over two thousand and when asked, no one will be able to explain it. I had my husband question them early on when I received an EOB from my insurance company from an outside lab for over a thousand dollars in lab charges and when questioned, Dr. STEIN'S WIFE replied, "Don't worry about it. We have an agreement with that lab for billing. Your account is fine." I eventually did get my husband to go see a reputable pain Dr after his bill jumped up with no explanation. Then, they took him to court and he went and contested it. Unfortunately, he does not read well and did not realize he only had a couple weeks to fill out his arguement and get it in. He didn't give me the paperwork because we were extremely busy moving and I was working long hours. Since he didn't get his paperwork in within that two week period, Dr Stein was awarded over three thousand dollars. We never did get an explanation as to why the bill went from three hundred to three thousand dollars. My guess would be the fraudulent urine drug screening charges. Now, they are taking the money from MY checks. I am not done with them. I am so angry, they are taking food and necessities from my children.Was this rating useful? 3 flag | Submitted April 15, 2015 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr Stein is excellent!! If you have physical proof that you suffer from pain{ MRI, X-RAYS } He will give you the best options of what is right for you. I have been a patient for over a year and don't mind a drug screen every visit cause I have nothing to hide. Listen to him and do what is expected of you. If all you want is a script for opiates then don't come here because he is not a quack. The staff is excellent and friendly Dr. stein is very professional and listens to his patients. Like I said if you have proof you suffer he will help you. You people that are bad-mouthing need to keep going to your street dealer because dr. stein does not just hand out pain meds

I NEVER in my life been to a clinic that the dr. talked to me like a child. after my first app. the first thing I said to my friend was" he didn't even look at me " His eyes looked down the whole two min/ he was in the room.. I thought it was just me until I read these other messages from others.... WOW.. SO HIS WIFE WORKS WITH HIM . MY LAST APPOINTMENT I ASKED FORN CREAM. SHE SAID WE DONT DO THAT HEAR.. WHAT?
