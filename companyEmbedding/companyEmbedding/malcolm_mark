Detailed item info
Mark Addy (THE FULL MONTY and the television series STILL STANDING) plays a night-shift taxi driver married to two women and utterly desperate to keep them from meeting each other and realizing the truth in this British comedy shot on location in Blackpool and Liverpool. Addy deftly creates the impression that he deeply and simultaneously loves his wives, but when they both happen to coincidentally demand that he take each of them to the same rock concert, he knows he's in deep trouble, and winds up literally shooting himself in the foot.Product DetailsNumber of Discs:1Rating:Not RatedFilm Country:United KingdomUPC:084296406586Additional DetailsGenre:ComediesFormat:DVD

Married 2 Malcolm - silly, but British
I got this movie because I loved Josie Lawrence on UK "Whose Line Is It Anyway".  Mark Addy was fun in "The Full Monty".  Well....for me, personally, take the very funky Josie Lawrence out of this movie and the DVD makes an attractive, shiny coaster. Or an obtuse travelogue for England's Blackpool area. Or, a film to play for any randy old people who haven't the constitution for actual porn.

Hey - There IS an idea in this film.  A guy can't choose between his domineering, far-out, nympho sex kitten girlfriend (in her messy, dark house), or his idyllic little subservient housewife (in her bright, clean house - complete with supper on the table) so he's in a bind.  A valid commentary on how the Christian family unit doesn't ultimately satisfy people?  Hmmm...well, competent writers and filmakers could have made a memorable, wild, weird cult film here.  Instead, the result is simply asinine.  Hollywood invades Britain.

Married 2 Malcolm
I loved Mark Addy in "The Full Monty" and totally enjoy Josie Lawrence's comedy so my hopes were high.  I found this movie unwatchable.

To be ready for 2020, brands must commit to global; they must think and act in borderless ways.”







Jason Hill
Director, Global Media Strategy, GE






The power of digital is in transformational change, not additive garnish.







Tom Goodwin
Founder, Tomorrow Group






“It’s really no surprise that senior marketing leaders tell us again and again that their greatest stress-point is knowing where their future talent will come from.”







Richard Robinson

Akihiko Kubo
President, Ogilvy & Mather Japan






The dearth of fresh talent has always been a concern, but never more so than now.







Nancy Hill
President & CEO, American Association of Advertising Agencies (4As)






Advertising agents were always known as the ‘hidden persuaders’. We do that through our craft of story telling, art, and design. We will still need to be able to persuade people but it might be that we need to persuade them to give up their data rather than buy some Nike shoes.







Alessandra Lariu
CEO, Shout; Co-Founder, SheSays






Advertising in 2020 harnesses the expansive power of creativity and the reductive power of science and big data to usher in a new era of marketing communications.







Carl Marci
CEO & Chief Science Officer, Innerscope Research, Inc.

The future of advertisement will therefore be more and more on the development of ideas that have the power to inspire sharing and buzz.







Peter Field
President, Field Consulting






And as it is emerging now, digital’s virtual-world will be blended into our real-world lives. Digital does not mean we will stay glued to our devices. We all still crave real experiences, parties, concerts, sports, meetings, dates, comedy clubs and more. It’s just that we will want technology to be blended with those real-world experiences. Digital will not be a silo, or a medium. It will be a facilitator and an enhancer to our lifestyles.







Matthew Godfrey
President, Y&R Asia






By 2020 the ïlike-ability indexÍ will be even more important to advertising in all its forms. The biggest shift will be the migration from traditional selling messages to innovative experiential, visual/sensory formats that instantly stimulate feelings of not only liking but that most valuable of brand attributes, trust.







Mac Cato
Chairman, Cato Consulting






The migration of TV/video distribution to more pure IP (internet protocol) delivery infrastructure, coupled with “big data” advances in set-top analytics will usher in a new era of audience-based targeting that will make the last 15+ years of online advertising formation look like child’s play.







Tim Hanlon
Founder and CEO, The Vertere Group, LLC






As marketers, we must learn how to tell our brand stories in a compelling way. Of course it’s necessary to capture the attention of our audiences, but it’s exponentially more important to discover how to keep it.







Pearse McCabe
CEO, Dragon Rouge New York






Consumers have become more independent, apathetic towards ads (even if personalized), empowered throughout their purchase journey, and involved in the branded products and services they consume; making the traditional one-way relationship less relevant. And you know what? This is great news! For consumers… But also for advertising.







Ayal Levin and David Fogel
McCann Erickson






We need to go back to the basics and remember even digital needs a human touch for it to be soulful. Soulful advertising comes from those who interrogate their souls and that of the people they serve in order to be able to tell the truth in a way that affirms, alters, enhances people’s lives while making money or profit.







Mzamo Masito
Managing Executive: Brand & Comms, Vodacom






The future of all advertising belongs to Google.







Michael Hussey
CEO, Peekanalytics






Gone are the days where one form of mass media usurps another in terms of importance. We have entered an era of rapid evolution where new models are constantly emerging and competing for the prosumer share-of-mind. As fundamental as it may sound, the very best thing any marketer can do to ensure their success is to offer goods that deliver on their promises.







Peter Koeppel
President, Koeppel Direct






Advertising will continue to move from a push model, where the advertisements viewed by consumers were at the discretion of companies and agencies, to a model where consumers can choose to see and engage with their ads or not. It will no longer be about bombarding consumers with advertising noise, but rather saying the right stuff to the right people ensuring greater relevance.







George Musi
Head of Cross Media Analytics, DG-MediaMind






In a future where all kinds of objects are internet-connected, instant gratification will take on new meaning – if it rains and you don’t have an umbrella, the sensor in your wet shoes will send a signal to a retailer who will meet you with a rain jacket.







Russell Dubner
President, Edelman NY






Much of the content on the web will be developed by consumers themselves. Content which is developed by the brands or co created will have to be of a high standard to differentiate itself from the mass of consumer generated content and will have to clearly reflect the brands values, beliefs and benefits.







Martin Riley
Chief Marketing Officer, Pernod-Ricard






With the democratization of media we are no longer in control of the message. We are one voice among many and if we don’t communicate with integrity we will suffer the consequences.







Malcolm Roberts
Founding Partner, Corktown Seed Co.






Advertisers won’t simply be tasked with creating demand for a product – they will be tasked with creating demand for the ad.







Bryan Pearson
CEO, LoyaltyOne






Perfectly timely delivery of advertising messages is great but it only takes a brand so far.







Paul Reilly
SVP, Executive Managing Director, BBDO Toronto






The industry clings steadfastly to conceptual frameworks that in many cases date back 50 years or more. And the fact is that many of these frameworks are not just wrong but seriously misleading.







Mark Tomblin
Chief Strategy Officer, TAXI






Advertising of the future will not be tasked with creating desire outside the consumer’s frame of reference, but instead spark an innate desire from within the consumer’s own frame of reference.







Lori Billey
Managing Director, RED The Agency






Great opportunities won’t wait for long briefing, incubation, approval and production cycles. There will have to be parallel work streams for spontaneous and opportunistic creative that addresses something going on in the brand and consumer’s world.







Arthur Fleischmann
President, john st. advertising






Advertising has and will always be about selling.







Mark Morris
Former Chairman, Worldwide Client Director, Bates North America
