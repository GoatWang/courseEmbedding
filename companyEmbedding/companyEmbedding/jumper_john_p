Tanker Lease Scandal[edit]
On June 7, 2005 General Jumper apologized to Senator McCain for internal Air Force emails about the Senator in the context of the tanker lease scandal, calling them "unprofessional and not worthy of a great Air Force."[6]
Thunderbirds "Thundervision" Scandal[edit]
Members of the United States Air Force were under investigation by the FBI for having awarded a $50 million contract for audio-visual presentation services to Strategic Message Solutions of Plymouth Meeting, Pa.[7][8][9] The contract involved the "Thundervision" project, meant to provide oversized video screens and perhaps content services during air shows that featured the Air Force Thunderbirds. The investigation revolves around possible involvement of Jumper, and then Chief of Staff of the Air Force T. Michael Moseley. It was suggested that the contract price was inflated, because a friend of the two generals, Air Force General (ret.) Hal Hornburg, was associated with Strategic Message Solutions.[10] Two companies involved in the bidding process protested award of the contract, one having offered comparable services for half as much. The Air Force later cancelled the contract.[11]

Tanker Lease Scandal[edit]
On June 7, 2005 General Jumper apologized to Senator McCain for internal Air Force emails about the Senator in the context of the tanker lease scandal, calling them "unprofessional and not worthy of a great Air Force."[6]
Thunderbirds "Thundervision" Scandal[edit]
Members of the United States Air Force were under investigation by the FBI for having awarded a $50 million contract for audio-visual presentation services to Strategic Message Solutions of Plymouth Meeting, Pa.[7][8][9] The contract involved the "Thundervision" project, meant to provide oversized video screens and perhaps content services during air shows that featured the Air Force Thunderbirds. The investigation revolves around possible involvement of Jumper, and then Chief of Staff of the Air Force T. Michael Moseley. It was suggested that the contract price was inflated, because a friend of the two generals, Air Force General (ret.) Hal Hornburg, was associated with Strategic Message Solutions.[10] Two companies involved in the bidding process protested award of the contract, one having offered comparable services for half as much. The Air Force later cancelled the contract.[11]

Tanker Lease Scandal[edit]
On June 7, 2005 General Jumper apologized to Senator McCain for internal Air Force emails about the Senator in the context of the tanker lease scandal, calling them "unprofessional and not worthy of a great Air Force."[6]
Thunderbirds "Thundervision" Scandal[edit]
Members of the United States Air Force were under investigation by the FBI for having awarded a $50 million contract for audio-visual presentation services to Strategic Message Solutions of Plymouth Meeting, Pa.[7][8][9] The contract involved the "Thundervision" project, meant to provide oversized video screens and perhaps content services during air shows that featured the Air Force Thunderbirds. The investigation revolves around possible involvement of Jumper, and then Chief of Staff of the Air Force T. Michael Moseley. It was suggested that the contract price was inflated, because a friend of the two generals, Air Force General (ret.) Hal Hornburg, was associated with Strategic Message Solutions.[10] Two companies involved in the bidding process protested award of the contract, one having offered comparable services for half as much. The Air Force later cancelled the contract.[11]

AEF - General John P. Jumper - 2/00























































General John P. Jumper
Commander, Air Combat Command
        AFA Air Warfare Symposium 2000
        February 24, 2000
        

Thank you very much. I would like to start
        off by acknowledging how very fortunate we are to have the Air Force
        Association as our Air Force advocates. I cite the example the Chief
        mentioned of the drive-by shooting last year on the F-22. It was
        commendable how quickly the Air Force Association mobilized its
        intellectual forces and got out for us all the materials and the
        arguments and the facts that we needed to deal with that situation.
        Great airpower advocates like Dr. Rebecca Grant were able to put
        together for us the sort of advocacy we needed to turn that decision
        around. Personally, I was gratified during the Kosovo war, when we had
        many taking the stage in front of microphones critical of the conduct of
        the war--who, I might add understand very little about it--again the AFA
        mobilized forces and helped us, who were over there struggling to deal
        with a very difficult situation, to get the facts out before our people
        in uniform, our people in the military, and the American people. It was
        that confidence and consensus that we felt across the ocean and passed
        on to Mike Short [Lt. Gen. Michael C. Short, Commander, Allied Forces
        Southern Europe], who was able to deliver us the success that we saw in
        Kosovo. From all of us out there who wear the blue uniforms, to the
        leadership here assembled from the AFA today and the membership out
        there in the audience--from all of us airmen, I think we owe our AFA a
        big round of applause and a big thank you.
AFA is all about leadership, and Id like
        to mention one other not with us this year, General Bruce K. Holloway,
        who sat right down there among the front rows. Of the years Ive been
        attending this conference and speaking at this conference, after every
        one Id get a very nice note from General Holloway. He had a profound
        impact on the beginnings of this effort at Orlando and we owe him a
        great debt of gratitude. He will be missed.
In that light, talking about leaders, our
        great leaders in our Air Force  weve had some great ones. Arnold,
        Mitchell, Doolittle. Each of those people transformed the power of a
        vision they had for airpower into milestone events that have propelled
        us into this new century as a force in demand. Daily in the skies over
        Iraq, contingencies-- as we have witnessed in Kosovo, be they the bomb
        dropping type or the humanitarian type that we saw in Albania--we were
        able to demonstrate the power of the force that brings together global
        vigilance, global reach, and global power available only through the
        complex integration of mobility forces, fighter forces, bomber forces,
        space warriors, information warriors, special operators, and all of that
        agile combat support that goes into delivering what the Chief calls
        aerospace superiority and decision dominance.
I recently read a book about the battle of
        Thermopylae called the Gates of Fire. It is about the Spartans,
        and it gives a detailed account of how Spartan warriors lived and the
        immense value they put on protecting the person that stood next to them
        in battle: perhaps the first and most eloquent expression of the
        wing-man concept. It is that sort of leadership, that sort of mutual
        support, that we in our Air Force need to develop fully and to
        demonstrate as we look forward to the challenges of this next century. I
        am going to talk about a few of those things today.
I am going to start with leadership in
        command. We are fortunate that we had Mike Short available and ready and
        in position as a numbered Air Force commander when the conflict in
        Serbia kicked off. Mike Short trained himself in the operational level
        of warfare. Like most of the people in uniform in this room today up in
        these front rows wearing lots of stars, we all trained ourselves.
        Because our system did not train us. As those in the front row--I
        watched them sink lower and lower--they will have to admit that all of
        us spend a career avoiding Blue Flag. If you were sent to Blue Flag, it
        was because you were near death. I recall being sent to command a Blue
        Flag from my position as the vice commander at Eglin [Air Force Base]. I
        got sent there because I was the newest vice commander in Tactical Air
        Command at the time. There I met Dave Deptula [Brig. Gen. David A.
        Deptula, director, Expeditionary Aerospace Force Implementation] , who
        was there holding his guts in from a recent hernia operation. Only
        because he was DNIF [Duty Not Involving Flying] did he show up at Blue
        Flag. I am glad he did, because it was there he began to learn the
        things about command and control and command of aerospace power that
        make him so valuable to our Air Force today.
We need to take those steps that
        consciously train our colonels and generals to command aerospace power
        at the operational level so the next time we deal with [Slobodan]
        Milosevic, we have the tools at our disposal, practiced and proficient,
        to bring about that victory with much less anxiety than Mike Short had
        to deal with. What that means in very short, simple and direct sentences
        is that wars are not won by managing processes, but by leading warriors
        who kill targets.
Our confusion about this has been very
        honest. Quite frankly, at Blue Flag, we had learned about the command
        and control of airpower. We learned to deal with very cantankerous
        pieces of technology like CTAPS [Contingency Theater Automated Planning
        System]. The CTAPS terminals at the time, we spent more time trying to
        make them work than those systems work for us. To generate an ATO [Air
        Tasking Order] with a thousand sorties was hard work, and we never got
        to the part where colonels and generals were required to mass and
        concentrate forces to shift centers of gravity or to do the things that
        Mike Short was required to do in real-time in his real combat
        experience.
In other ways, weve also confused
        process with product. In the ISR world, Intelligence, Surveillance and
        Reconnaissance, that world grew up where we paid most homage to the
        collection process. That collection process turned out not to be very
        agile when we tried to shift it into the targeting cycle, especially the
        rapid targeting cycle. We will have conquered this problem when we
        understand that no target ever died in the collection process - it only
        dies in the targeting process. We dont pop the cork when the image
        arrives. We pop the cork when the target is dead.
We have our intel warriors out there that
        understand that. The experience that Mike Short brought to that
        community is going to make that a permanent change and a permanent
        fixture in our Air Force. One thing we have to keep straight when we are
        talking about process and product: our product in war is dead targets
        and our product in peace is all that goes into generating the warrior
        proficiency that kills those targets in wartime. The two things that are
        the hardest that we do in peacetime is to fly airplanes and to fix
        airplanes. As the chief mentioned, some of our MC [Mission Capable]
        rates and our U [Unserviceable] rates have suffered in the latter part
        of this decade and I thank George Babbitt [Gen. George T. Babbitt,
        commander, Air Force Materiel Command] and those in AFMC and those on
        the Hill and those in the leadership here in the front rows that have
        taken this problem to heart and put back into our spare parts and our
        repair processes over $500 million dedicated to making sure we get back
        to those levels of sortie generation and proficiency that gave us that
        force we took to Desert Storm because that is, after all, the
        standard.
We are also trying to do the same with
        maintenance experience levels and manpower, and the leadership of your
        Air Force is paying the same attention to those shortages. About
        doctrine, one of the things that went along with not wanting to go to
        Blue flag was not paying attention to our doctrine. There were a lot of
        reasons for that, too. First of all, what we enjoyed the most and what
        was the most fun was tactical level doctrine, the doctrine of the 4-ship
        or the 16-ship. We were all very good at that, and that is where we
        plied our craft with the greatest enthusiasm. We grew up with stovepiped
        doctrine, and each stove pipe or tribe had its own doctrine. Only in
        this decade have we really set about to integrate that doctrine in ways
        that bring air power to bear in a more comprehensive way. We can thank
        Ron Keys [Maj. Gen. Ronald E. Keys] and Tim Canan and Lance Smith [Maj.
        Gen. Lance L. Smith] for their efforts to codify and make readable and
        usable the doctrine that will propel us into this century and bring us
        together as an aerospace force.
Our expeditionary air force, as the Chief
        mentioned, is going to be key to getting our hands around and our arms
        around our optempo problem. That has been described in some detail. It
        brings to light new capabilities that we need. One of those, I believe,
        is what I call the first-in capability that comes with a contingency
        response force of some time. We did this over in Europe just weeks
        before the Albania crisis, where we went in and dealt with a refugee
        problem approaching 800,000 refugees. The contingency response group
        commander and a small force of about 150 went in and established base
        security, communications, engineering capability, radar approach
        control, with such proficiency that the president of the country turned
        all of the airspace of Albania over to this small group of people to
        execute the humanitarian relief operation.
Whether we are killing targets or killing
        famine, as the Chief said, we execute those with equal vitality and
        rigor. It is this sort of a force. When we took the Chief down and
        showed him this force at Ramstein [Air Base, Germany], we had lined up
        in full combat gear a group of civil engineers, communicators, lawyers,
        political advisors, all adept and fully qualified to defend themselves
        and to man posts that defend airfields. It is this sort of return to the
        composite air strike force combat warrior live-under-the-wing
        mentality that is going to make us fully capable in our new
        expeditionary air force.
Also, when we think about where we are and
        where we need to go, we cant do any of it without modernization. It
        is not only the doctrine. It is not only the ISR [Intelligence,
        Surveillance and Reconnaissance]. It is not only the command of
        airpower. It is the tools we give our aerospace force to execute what we
        ask them to execute. Clausewitz talked about the fog of war, but I worry
        that we are not more challenged by the fog of peace. As we look at more
        and more countries developing weapons of mass destruction, acquiring
        advanced surface-to-air missile systems, and while we bask in the
        success of air superiority, we also see countries building and acquiring
        air superiority aircraft that rival our own and in many cases exceed our
        own capability. As the Chief said, one of the problems we have to deal
        with is, we make it look too easy. It wasnt easy, and Mike Short will
        talk about this. We lost two airplanes in the skies over Serbia, but we
        had more than 700 surface-to-air missiles fired at us. We had aircraft,
        Mike Shorts son among them, struggle home with holes, with embedded
        [air-to-] surface missiles, and got airplanes on the ground through
        superb discipline and airmanship. Another person we owe a great deal of
        thanks to was the perseverance and outright stubbornness of a great
        leader, Mike Short, who brought all those aircrews home alive.
If Mr. Milosevic had had an SA-10 or an
        SA-12--and he well could have--or the latest generation of
        fighter--which he could well have--Mike would have faced a profoundly
        more difficult situation than he did, and we would have been having a
        debate over why we didnt have the F-22 five years ago instead of
        several years from now. The F-22 will bring us not only the air
        superiority that we traditionally think of in the air-to-air role, but
        that total air superiority of a first-in capability that takes out the
        airplanes and those most potent surface-to-air defenses that would
        otherwise limit our access to targets. That is why we need the F-22.
        That is why we need your support. That is why we need to send our airmen
        in, and that is why we need to counter those who would wish to opt for
        that force that could win the next one by a score of 51-49 when our
        standard and the standard of the American people is 100-0.
When we talk about integration, we also
        need to intellectualize a bit and think about how well we do with
        systems like the F-22 and apply that same thought process to those
        things where we leverage aerospace power at the operational level, our
        Air Operations Center. We need to think of our AOC as a weapon system.
        We all recall sitting in the cockpit of the F-4--and this illustrates
        the difference between the way we do it now and the way we could be
        doing it. We sat in the cockpit of the F-4 and we saw strobes in our RAU
        [radar warning receiver] gear, some from the air and some from the
        ground. We had a radar over here that had some hits on it, some of those
        hits were probably causing some of these strobes. Wed integrate the
        beeps and the squeaks in the pods--that you didnt know worked,
        because the pod switch was attached to the switch that went on and off.
        We integrated that with a lot of prayer. But all that integration went
        right up here. When I look at some of my colleagues in the front row
        today, that sort of scares me as I think about it.
The F-22 was really our kind of airplane.
        We didnt have it. It was this thing with a picture of your airplane
        in the middle and a little fan out the nose that tells you how far your
        radar can look against the thing that is looking at you and a little fan
        out that enemy airplanes nose. And rings on the ground that tell you
        how vulnerable you are to that surface-to-air missile, and they can
        expand and contract by the pitch, roll, and attitude of the airplane at
        the second you are looking at the scope and youve got a little oblate
        spheroid sticking out the front of your airplane that describes the
        envelope of your JDAM [Joint Direct Attack Munition] and you get that
        target that is shown by a Maltese cross into that little oblate spheroid
        and hit the pickle button. And in the meantime you are focusing on what?
        Keeping that airplane out of those rings, knowing what those threats
        are, because the information that is presented to you is
        decision-quality information.
Translate that to the Air Operations Center
        that Mike Short had to deal with during this war. Yeah, you had an
        operational picture, but you didnt have everything. You had a lot of
        inputs, but that correlation was going on right up here. We have the
        technology. We have the wizardry--It is sitting right here in this
        room--to fix that, and we need to put some energy into making that
        happen and making it happen soon.
A final topic today. I want to talk a
        little bit about the warrior ethic. We as leaders have a responsibility
        to help those who serve feel damned good about what they do; to
        understand that quality of life to us in service is not a higher
        standard of living, but a higher standard for life overall. There are no
        greater rewards than the rewards associated with being a part of
        something that is bigger than yourself. This past year alone, our
        pilots, our maintainers, our communicators, our security forces, all of
        them - great men and women in uniform - did something very profound.
        They saved hundreds of thousands of lives in Kosovo. Today whole
        families are alive, who would otherwise have been brutally murdered,
        because of our people who wear the blue suit. Although all of them were
        not out dropping bombs and directly involved with killing targets, even
        those communicators who were installing the local area networks at the
        many bases that we opened up, who made sure the communications happened,
        who did the negotiations with the base commanders, who made sure the
        fuel was pure, who built the tent cities, who strung up the electrical
        power, who minister to the forces, all of them were warriors.
We need to do a better job of recognizing
        those things that are a privilege to those of us who wear the uniform.
        Those of us who are privileged enough to raise our right hand and take
        an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States
        claim a special right to a special pride. We have to make that felt. We
        need to talk about it. We need to make our people understand how very
        special they are.
General Omar Bradley said once that bravery
        is the capacity to perform properly even when you are scared half to
        death. In our quality of life, we have those who have demonstrated the
        courage and the bravery that goes along with saving the lives of
        hundreds of thousands of helpless people, and we should be proud of
        that.
In our short, distinguished history, our
        Air Force is replete with stories. I tell the story of Staff Sergeant
        Maynard Smith from Cairo, Michigan, on his first combat mission as a
        gunner in World War II. His airplane came under heavy fire, and two crew
        members on board were seriously injured, couldnt bail out. The
        aircrafts oxygen system was shot out. Several control cables were
        severed and intense fires raged across the aircraft as small caliber
        ammunition cooked off. Three of the crew members did bail out, but
        Sergeant Smith stayed. He fought the fire. He manned the guns that were
        still working and fought off the enemy fighters, administered first aid
        to the crew on board, among those the pilot and the co-pilot. And his
        actions ensured that the aircraft got home safely. Staff Sergeant
        Maynard Smith became the first enlisted airman to receive our nations
        highest award, the Medal of Honor.
Just recently, in Allied Force, on
        the night of March 27, 1999, as I sat in my command post, I listened to
        that sound that all airmen dread to hear, that sound of a beeper going
        off, and all of us who have been involved in combat know well that sound
        and the reaction it brings when you hear it. Due to the marvels of
        technology that night, we heard it as it happened with that same cringe.
        Captain Chad Franks and his MH-60 crew were scrambled on a rescue
        mission that required them to fly into a very sophisticated air-defense
        system on a mission that was much longer than they anticipated because
        of confusion over the location of the downed pilot. It required them to
        conduct low-level refueling and ingress in the most difficult
        circumstances around AAA [Anti-Aircraft Artillery] and search lights.
        Within just a few kilometers of three Serbian Army brigades, they
        ingressed, put PJs [pararescuemen] out and ran the hundred yards from
        the helicopter to the pilot to get the pilot on board and get that pilot
        out. Then they had an equally harrowing journey on the way out back
        through the small arms barrages, the searchlights, etc. Captain Franks
        was awarded the Silver Star and his crew also decorated for bravery in
        saving the life of that American pilot.
It is that kind of courage and bravery that
        makes ours a higher standard of life. In closing, as we consider our
        role in this new century, I want to go back to my story of the Spartans.
        The Spartans were 300 in number, the year was 480 BC, and the leader was
        King Leonidis. His charge was to gather a group of volunteers to do
        battle against the Persian King Xerxes who, although he had an army of
        about 3 million, put 10,000 against the 300 Spartans in this small,
        narrow gap called Thermopylae, which translates into the gates of
        fire. Before that battle, the Persian envoy representing Xerxes
        warned Leonidis that it was futile to fight the Persians because the
        archers were so numerous that the arrows would block out the sun. In
        that true moment, which we see so seldom, that truly captures that
        warrior spirit, Leonidis responded, so much the better. Well be
        able to fight in the shade. Leonidis picked that narrow passage and
        paid the ultimate price, because the 300 died to the last person. They
        held off those 10,000 Persian troops long enough for the Greeks to
        muster an army that finally did defeat Xerxes. What historians fail to
        acknowledge was that very moment in history when the Greeks were
        founding this thing we call democracy. As we talk about warriors and the
        warrior spirit, we thank Leonidis for delivering us where we are and the
        great warriors of our Air Force for displaying that spirit so proudly. I
        say to you, God bless the airmen of our Air Force. God bless the AFA.
        And God bless America. Thank you.
Q&A Session
General Shaud: What kind of regime
        would you like to see for our future Air Force JFACCs [Joint Force Air
        Component Commander] or even Joint Force commanders?
General Jumper: The first thing you
        have to do is quit worrying about the istinction between training and
        education. We have for a long time in our Air Force jealously guarded
        that distinction, but in the case of the command, the planning and
        execution of aerospace power, even at the senior levels, there is a lot
        of training that needs to go on. These are habits that are formed not
        out of malice, but out of the lack of equipment to do the job. What we
        generated from operations like Blue Flag and other things was a
        generation of commanders who worked very hard to generate the ATO, and
        in the execution phase, all that we practiced was administering that ATO.
        We didnt have the simulations or the wherewithal to put ourselves
        into the conditions of battle that required that response. That is what
        we need to do. We need an RTU [Replacement Training Unit], an IQT
        [Initial Qualification Training], a mission qualification training and a
        weapons school that trains the command and control of airpower to the
        same level that we train those great 4-ship and battle force commanders
        out there to lead at that tactical level. That is what we have to do.
        Some of it is in AETC [Air Education and Training Command]. Some of it
        is at the IQT and RTU level. And some of it is in a center of excellence
        that we hope to build at Nellis [Air Force Base].
General Shaud: On Kosovo, what is
        the single most important thing to change or most glaring weakness that
        you ran into?
General Jumper: From my perspective,
        the thing we need to work on the hardest is the horizontal integration
        of our ISR assets and the correlation of those assets to our command and
        control depot so that we can get down to the business, which I know we
        can do, of real-time targeting. As the chief said, we need to do it in
        minutes. I would challenge us to do it in single-digit minutes.
General Shaud: From your experience
        with information warfare during Operation Allied Force, what
        lessons have you learned there and what do you bring to ACC [Air Combat
        Command]?
General Jumper: The lesson is we
        need to operationalize information warfare. We need to treat offensive
        and defensive counter-information with equal weight, and we need to
        continue to try to shift the focus from the strategic level of
        information warfare to the tactical and operational level, because the
        thing that is most valuable to commanders is the tactical and
        operational level of information warfare. The other thing we have to do
        is deal with the security system that so suffocates our information
        warfare tools. The way to do that is to try to make that distinction
        between the security programs that are useful and necessary during the
        development phases of technology and understand that they do not
        translate readily to the operational world. Operators dont often have
        to know how the bit or byte parses itself en route to destruction, they
        just need to know the effect.
General Shaud: With an analysis of
        alternatives for CSAR [Combat Search and Rescue] modernization, what are
        the crucial differences in current CSAR capabilities and where you would
        like that to go?
General Jumper: The crucial
        differences are: some of its in hardware; most of its in tactics
        and procedures. And its the blending and the melding and the integration
        of [passage missed in tape transfer] and the assets and the resources to
        integrate all of those tools that need to be at their disposal when the
        time comes to go in and pick up that downed aircrew. And we owe it to
        the great, remarkable leadership of a bunch of captains that were able
        to pull off the rescues that we saw as proficiently as they did. So we
        are going to create the situation where we can put the ISR
        [Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance] platforms and the other
        location tools at the disposal of those CSAR forces as well as to
        practice with our special operators to bring that level of daily
        proficiency up to where it needs to be.
General Shaud: Please explain the
        importance of EW [Electronic Warfare] to ACC [Air Combat Command]
        operations. As you think of leading EW into the 21st Century,
        what is your plan and what are the lessons learned during Operation
        Allied Force?
General Jumper: My first plan is to
        meet with the Old Crows. Ive got do that. And I need to talk
        with them a little bit about the difference between bashing electrons
        and manipulating electrons. We all have to get on the same page here.
        Because right now those forces seem to be opposed to one another. But
        its a lot more than taking the latest, greatest circuit card that
        puts out 75,000 gigawatts to bash those electrons harder and perhaps
        that little bitty microchip that can get in and manipulate those
        electrons to produce the same effect. We have to work on the definition
        of electronic warfare and what we go about to defend and start worrying
        about the effect of electronic warfare to get airplanes in to kill
        targets. Thats what were after. Theres lots of ways to do that;
        we have to get together on what that means, and were going to go
        after whatever that thing takes to do it.
General Shaud: Next question,
        Johnnie, is a personnel question, and we move to the Guard and Reserve:
        How confident are you that Guard and Reserve can keep up with the
        increasing pace of deployments in our EAF [Expeditionary Aerospace
        Force] concepts?
General Jumper: I have no worry
        about the Guard and Reserves (applause). Its like I say about space:
        Well finally get it, and we dont have to talk about the
        integration of air and space anymore. And I think with the Guard and
        Reserve, were almost there. I looked at a slide every day when I was
        over in Speedys [General Gregory S. Martin] job, and I looked at
        upwards of 1,500 Guard and Reserve members deployed to USAFE [U.S. Air
        Forces Europe] every day, and that was in normal operations. Twice that
        number during the war. I went out to a guard post in Incerlik and was
        met by three enlisted men who rendered a smart salute. I was asking them
        where they were from, expecting to hear Langley Air Force Base or
        Lakenheath Air Base. Where are we from? Sir, I am a sheriff in
        Little Rock, Arkansas. And my buddies here: this ones here from
        someplace else, and I cant remember the places. Three Guardsmen. And
        I said, Well, what do you think of this? Sir, we couldnt be
        prouder of what were doing. We all volunteered to get here, and by
        the way, our communities are proud to have us over here. We can hardly
        wait to go back and tell our story. [applause] Enough said.
General Shaud: The next question,
        written by a Congressional staffer who thinks he will see you shortly.
        [laughter] Sir, as the new commander of ACC, how do you discuss the need
        for both the F-22 and the Joint Strike Fighter in these tight fiscal
        times?
General Jumper: We have a need to
        leverage that stealth capability in a way that assures us access to the
        target. We need to do it in sufficient numbers that we can go deep and
        handle the other target sets that present themselves. The way weve
        gone about this, traditionally, is with a high-low mix of aircraft like
        we had with the F-15 and the F-16, and it is time to modernize that
        force. And what the Joint Strike Fighter brings us is that long-range,
        agile capability to get to those targets, combined with the F-22's
        virtual guarantee of air superiority that continues to give us that
        level of assurance of combat capability that we have always been able to
        deliver this nation. Its that same high-low mix. Its nothing
        different than weve demonstrated before. Its what we owe those
        airmen that we send into combat.
General Shaud: Great answer. Hang in
        there, were with you. The final question: As you move from theater
        CINC [Commander-in-Chief] to the role of force provider, whats your
        greatest concern with respect to future military campaigns that you will
        be providing forces for?
General Jumper: Well, its the
        uncertainty of it all. Its the fog of peace. Its the great
        new world disorder. Because as you try and look out there and anticipate
        what youre going to do next, and you look back just five years, and
        ask yourself How well would we have done to anticipate what we went
        through in Kosovo? We would have done pretty well, but we wouldnt
        have gotten it all right. Because the part we would have missed was this
        unbelievable humanitarian challenge that we had to face. To go to the
        base at Tirana and face and deal with aircraft from many nations showing
        up on final approach. Cargo just thrown out the back of aircraft. And
        trying to bring sense to that while dealing with hundreds of thousands,
        hundreds of thousands, of refugees pouring across borders in bad weather
        and in ill health. We were not prepared for that, and what I like to say
        when I look at the spectrum of and the phases of war that we study in
        the Quadrennial Defense Review -- we start with deterrent options, then
        a deployment phase and a halt phase -- I want to stick in there a denial
        phase. Because what we had to deal with there was several very, very
        difficult of denial, where we didnt even acknowledge that problem
        existed, and it put us behind when we did have to act. And then we were
        forced into an execution simultaneous with deployment. And so it
        completely turns upside down our traditional notions of how we employ
        aerospace forces. We didnt have a halt phase in Kosovo in the
        conventional side of it. We watched the invasion happen. We watched the
        forces mass north of the Kosovo border. We watched the invasion happen.
        We watched the conventional forces link up with the paramilitary forces,
        about 40,000 of them. We watched the systematic killing begin and what
        we did, what Mike was asked to do with airpower, was not to halt, but to
        counterattack from the air. He was doing it while we were deploying. It
        is these combinations of the very difficult phases of war coming in
        difficult timing of it, while Tony Robertson [Gen. Charles T. Robertson,
        Commander in Chief, USTRANSCOM] was trying to give us a bunch of C-17s
        to deploy Task Force Hawk, also in the course of battle, that pile up on
        themselves and complicate what we train ourselves to do. And that is why
        I talk about commanding airpower. We have never had to face that sort of
        difficult situation before.
So it is, where is it going to be? It is
        the complexity of the scenarios as we introduce more and more political
        considerations like collateral damage -- valid considerations -- the
        role of politics in the targeting process, all compounds to make it more
        difficult on the commander.
General Shaud: I have a statement on
        this card: General Jumper, I am proud to serve in the same Air Force as
        you. Sir, I salute you. Thanks.
