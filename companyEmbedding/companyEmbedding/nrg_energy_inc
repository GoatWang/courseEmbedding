Free Home Solar Quote | Sunrun                                   3 Questions To Ask Before Going Solar There's never been a better time to consider going solar at home. As utility rates climb, the cost to install a solar panel system continues to fall, down 50% since 2007 alone. Even as costs fall, solar power remains a significant investment for any homeowner. To make things easier, we'll help you decide if solar is right for you by answering some frequently asked questions:  How much will I save on utility bills? How do I choose the right system? How do I select a provider?  1. How much will I save on utility bills? Solar protects you against rising utility rates, hidden fees, and surprise hikes in your electric bill. Savings quickly add up to thousands of dollars over the life of your system.   Your total savings depend on how high your electric rates are, how much sunshine you receive, and financial incentives like federal, state, and local tax credits. Even with those variables, the average U.S. homeowner could save $84 per month over their current electric bill. In some states, savings can top $150 per month.1 Over 20 years, savings can reach $20,000 or more.  Get an instant estimate         2. How do I choose the right system? It's important to find an experienced professional who can customize a system to your home's requirements. Here's what your installer will look for:   How much power do you need? Check your electric bills to determine how many kilowatts you use on an average day. Multiply that by .25 to find out how big your system should be. A typical system generates 5 kW per day, but your home may need less or more.   What's your climate?  The number of panels you need depends on how much solar radiation reaches the ground at your location in a given period of time. This is called insolation.   How much direct sun does your home get? In general, you'll need 100 square feet of south facing roof (or yard) space for every kilowatt of power your system generates, avoiding shadows from trees, chimneys or taller buildings.   3. How do I select a provider? Here are a few things to consider when choosing a solar professional:   Experience Be sure to find out how long the installer has been in business. An installer recommended by a national solar company will typically be around for the long haul, while smaller installers may come and go.    Reference Consider getting recent customer references. Check with the Better Business Bureau to make sure that no complaints have been filed, and look at customer reviews on websites like Angie's List and Yelp.   Credentials The installer should be licensed, bonded and insured. You can also ask about certification through the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners or completion of training programs accredited by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.   Partnerships Look for installers who partner with brands you know, like national home improvement chains or warehouse clubs. That's usually a good sign that the company is a safe bet.    Warranty Look for an installer that offers warranties for your roof and other critical parts of your system, like the inverter. Ask if they guarantee system production.           Why Choose Sunrun?  Sunrun has over 18 years of quality solar installation experience, and builds a new solar power system every 10 minutes. We invented the solar lease as an affordable way to go solar, and install more than $2 million of solar every day.

So far, so good.  Yes, I pay for the convenience of a 30 min charge on my leaf.  But I dont need to install a charger at home. I use a combination of fast charging and 120v slow at home.  And it works better than if I spent money to put 240v at home.







I have charged my car with electricity at NRG eVgo four times.  Electricity costs me 18.15 cents per kwh at home, sometimes a little more and sometimes a little less.  In contrast at NRG eVgo, I have to pay a charge which is nominally $1.50 per hour of time.  The electricity flows to my car at only 1.95 kw, or at 1/2 kw in the last half of the charging session.  The time seems to be rounded up to the next half hour.  So, to make it simple, I end up paying around $1.00 per kwh when at home the electricity sells for about 1/5 as much.  It is also less than at other charging stations.

I realize that NRG eVgo does have expenses, but the prices discourage me from charging.  The prices might not even be profit maximizing from theNRG eVgo standpoint, since I can honestly state that I have never once seen any other vehicle charging at the Level 2 charging station.

I realize that the NRG eVgo charging station is a convenience, but the price premium seems too much of a premium from my standpoint.

If the prices were stated as X per kwh, I would likely make more use of NRG eVgo.

NRG Energy, Inc. is a large American energy company, dual-headquartered in West Windsor Township, New Jersey,[4][5] and Houston, Texas.[1][6][7] It was formerly the wholesale arm of Xcel Energy, and was spun off in bankruptcy in 2004.[8]

Acquisitions[edit]
When the state of Texas deregulated the electricity market, the former Houston Lighting & Power (HL&P) was split into several companies.[9] In 2003 HL&P was split into Texas Genco (which got the power plants), CenterPoint Energy (which got the distribution system) and Reliant Energy (which provided the electricity to business and individuals).[10]
In 2006, NRG Energy bought Texas Genco from a group of private equity firms for roughly $5.9 billion.[11] Afterwards, in May 2009, NRG Energy acquired the retail operations of Reliant Energy. With those two moves, NRG's holdings represented most of the former HL&P and today serve 1.6 million customers in Texas. The retail operations continue to operate under the Reliant Energy name while the remainder of the former Reliant Energy became RRI Energy.
Following the acquisition of Reliant, NRG extended its retail footprint with the acquisition of Green Mountain Energy in November 2010.[12] In doing so, NRG also became the largest retailer of green power in the nation, providing all of its Green Mountain and many of its Reliant customers with energy derived from 100% renewable resources.[13]
NRG Energy completed its acquisition of GenOn Energy in December 2012[1] for $1.7 billion in stock and cash.[14] The GenOn name was retired in the merger, but the combined company retained GenOn's Houston headquarters to coordinate operations.[1]
In August 2013, NRG acquired Energy Curtailment Specialists, a Buffalo, New York based Demand response company.[15] The terms of the deal were not disclosed [16]




a Goal Zero battery, lamp and solar panel


In September 2014, NRG acquired Goal Zero, a manufacturer of personal solar power products.[17]
Naming rights[edit]
NRG Energy holds the naming rights to the NRG Park campus in Houston, Texas, home to the NRG Astrodome, NRG Stadium, NRG Arena and NRG Center.
On March 12, 2014, NRG Energy announced that they would be re-branding Reliant Park to replace "Reliant" on all signages to "NRG".
Wholesale generation[edit]
After the GenOn merger, NRG has 47,000 MW of total generation capacity, enough to power approximately 40 million homes.[18] Its nearly 100 power plants are located in 18 states in the Northeast, Chicago area, Gulf Coast, Southwest, Nevada, and California.[18] Generation facilities include mostly fossil fuel power plants powered by natural gas, oil, and coal; plus four wind farms (in Texas) and six solar farms (in California, Arizona, and New Mexico).[19] NRG also has a 44% ownership stake in the South Texas Nuclear Generating Station and a 37.5% stake in a coal power plant in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.[19] Some facilities use cogeneration and the company also owns 28MW of solar distributed generation.[19]
Retail electricity[edit]
NRG's Retail Power services provide electricity services to more than 2 million homes and businesses, mostly in Arizona and the Northeast.[citation needed]
Green energy initiatives[edit]




Nissan LEAF recharging from an EVgo network charging station in Houston, Texas


Beginning in 2009, NRG began an initiative to become an green energy producer in the United States and started investing money in clean energy projects.[20][21] They include onshore and offshore wind power, solar thermal energy, photovoltaic, and distributed solar power facilities, and repowering of some of their traditional coal plants with biomass.[20] In late 2010, NRG launched the "EVgo" network, the first completely private public car charging station network for electric power vehicles.[22]
The company signed a two-year agreement beginning in January 2011 to provide 100% renewable energy for the Empire State Building.[23][24]
Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas has been chair of a coalition to support the utility in their plan to replace its "decades-old, dirty" power plant in Astoria with a newer generator.[25] The company stated its intention in 2012 to replace 31 older oil generators with new gas generators that will increase the megawatts of power while reducing emissions.[25][26]

NRG Energy, Inc. is a large American energy company, dual-headquartered in West Windsor Township, New Jersey,[4][5] and Houston, Texas.[1][6][7] It was formerly the wholesale arm of Xcel Energy, and was spun off in bankruptcy in 2004.[8]

Acquisitions[edit]
When the state of Texas deregulated the electricity market, the former Houston Lighting & Power (HL&P) was split into several companies.[9] In 2003 HL&P was split into Texas Genco (which got the power plants), CenterPoint Energy (which got the distribution system) and Reliant Energy (which provided the electricity to business and individuals).[10]
In 2006, NRG Energy bought Texas Genco from a group of private equity firms for roughly $5.9 billion.[11] Afterwards, in May 2009, NRG Energy acquired the retail operations of Reliant Energy. With those two moves, NRG's holdings represented most of the former HL&P and today serve 1.6 million customers in Texas. The retail operations continue to operate under the Reliant Energy name while the remainder of the former Reliant Energy became RRI Energy.
Following the acquisition of Reliant, NRG extended its retail footprint with the acquisition of Green Mountain Energy in November 2010.[12] In doing so, NRG also became the largest retailer of green power in the nation, providing all of its Green Mountain and many of its Reliant customers with energy derived from 100% renewable resources.[13]
NRG Energy completed its acquisition of GenOn Energy in December 2012[1] for $1.7 billion in stock and cash.[14] The GenOn name was retired in the merger, but the combined company retained GenOn's Houston headquarters to coordinate operations.[1]
In August 2013, NRG acquired Energy Curtailment Specialists, a Buffalo, New York based Demand response company.[15] The terms of the deal were not disclosed [16]

In September 2014, NRG acquired Goal Zero, a manufacturer of personal solar power products.[17]
Naming rights[edit]
NRG Energy holds the naming rights to the NRG Park campus in Houston, Texas, home to the NRG Astrodome, NRG Stadium, NRG Arena and NRG Center.
On March 12, 2014, NRG Energy announced that they would be re-branding Reliant Park to replace "Reliant" on all signages to "NRG".
Wholesale generation[edit]
After the GenOn merger, NRG has 47,000 MW of total generation capacity, enough to power approximately 40 million homes.[18] Its nearly 100 power plants are located in 18 states in the Northeast, Chicago area, Gulf Coast, Southwest, Nevada, and California.[18] Generation facilities include mostly fossil fuel power plants powered by natural gas, oil, and coal; plus four wind farms (in Texas) and six solar farms (in California, Arizona, and New Mexico).[19] NRG also has a 44% ownership stake in the South Texas Nuclear Generating Station and a 37.5% stake in a coal power plant in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.[19] Some facilities use cogeneration and the company also owns 28MW of solar distributed generation.[19]
Retail electricity[edit]
NRG's Retail Power services provide electricity services to more than 2 million homes and businesses, mostly in Arizona and the Northeast.[citation needed]
Green energy initiatives[edit]




Nissan LEAF recharging from an EVgo network charging station in Houston, Texas


Beginning in 2009, NRG began an initiative to become an green energy producer in the United States and started investing money in clean energy projects.[20][21] They include onshore and offshore wind power, solar thermal energy, photovoltaic, and distributed solar power facilities, and repowering of some of their traditional coal plants with biomass.[20] In late 2010, NRG launched the "EVgo" network, the first completely private public car charging station network for electric power vehicles.[22]
The company signed a two-year agreement beginning in January 2011 to provide 100% renewable energy for the Empire State Building.[23][24]
Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas has been chair of a coalition to support the utility in their plan to replace its "decades-old, dirty" power plant in Astoria with a newer generator.[25] The company stated its intention in 2012 to replace 31 older oil generators with new gas generators that will increase the megawatts of power while reducing emissions.[25][26]

Beginning in 2009, NRG began an initiative to become an green energy producer in the United States and started investing money in clean energy projects.[20][21] They include onshore and offshore wind power, solar thermal energy, photovoltaic, and distributed solar power facilities, and repowering of some of their traditional coal plants with biomass.[20] In late 2010, NRG launched the "EVgo" network, the first completely private public car charging station network for electric power vehicles.[22]
The company signed a two-year agreement beginning in January 2011 to provide 100% renewable energy for the Empire State Building.[23][24]
Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas has been chair of a coalition to support the utility in their plan to replace its "decades-old, dirty" power plant in Astoria with a newer generator.[25] The company stated its intention in 2012 to replace 31 older oil generators with new gas generators that will increase the megawatts of power while reducing emissions.[25][26]

Free Home Solar Quote | Sunrun                                   3 Questions To Ask Before Going Solar There's never been a better time to consider going solar at home. As utility rates climb, the cost to install a solar panel system continues to fall, down 50% since 2007 alone. Even as costs fall, solar power remains a significant investment for any homeowner. To make things easier, we'll help you decide if solar is right for you by answering some frequently asked questions:  How much will I save on utility bills? How do I choose the right system? How do I select a provider?  1. How much will I save on utility bills? Solar protects you against rising utility rates, hidden fees, and surprise hikes in your electric bill. Savings quickly add up to thousands of dollars over the life of your system.   Your total savings depend on how high your electric rates are, how much sunshine you receive, and financial incentives like federal, state, and local tax credits. Even with those variables, the average U.S. homeowner could save $84 per month over their current electric bill. In some states, savings can top $150 per month.1 Over 20 years, savings can reach $20,000 or more.  Get an instant estimate         2. How do I choose the right system? It's important to find an experienced professional who can customize a system to your home's requirements. Here's what your installer will look for:   How much power do you need? Check your electric bills to determine how many kilowatts you use on an average day. Multiply that by .25 to find out how big your system should be. A typical system generates 5 kW per day, but your home may need less or more.   What's your climate?  The number of panels you need depends on how much solar radiation reaches the ground at your location in a given period of time. This is called insolation.   How much direct sun does your home get? In general, you'll need 100 square feet of south facing roof (or yard) space for every kilowatt of power your system generates, avoiding shadows from trees, chimneys or taller buildings.   3. How do I select a provider? Here are a few things to consider when choosing a solar professional:   Experience Be sure to find out how long the installer has been in business. An installer recommended by a national solar company will typically be around for the long haul, while smaller installers may come and go.    Reference Consider getting recent customer references. Check with the Better Business Bureau to make sure that no complaints have been filed, and look at customer reviews on websites like Angie's List and Yelp.   Credentials The installer should be licensed, bonded and insured. You can also ask about certification through the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners or completion of training programs accredited by the Interstate Renewable Energy Council.   Partnerships Look for installers who partner with brands you know, like national home improvement chains or warehouse clubs. That's usually a good sign that the company is a safe bet.    Warranty Look for an installer that offers warranties for your roof and other critical parts of your system, like the inverter. Ask if they guarantee system production.           Why Choose Sunrun?  Sunrun has over 18 years of quality solar installation experience, and builds a new solar power system every 10 minutes. We invented the solar lease as an affordable way to go solar, and install more than $2 million of solar every day.

NRG Energy, Inc. is a large American energy company, dual-headquartered in West Windsor Township, New Jersey,[4][5] and Houston, Texas.[1][6][7] It was formerly the wholesale arm of Xcel Energy, and was spun off in bankruptcy in 2004.[8]

Acquisitions[edit]
When the state of Texas deregulated the electricity market, the former Houston Lighting & Power (HL&P) was split into several companies.[9] In 2003 HL&P was split into Texas Genco (which got the power plants), CenterPoint Energy (which got the distribution system) and Reliant Energy (which provided the electricity to business and individuals).[10]
In 2006, NRG Energy bought Texas Genco from a group of private equity firms for roughly $5.9 billion.[11] Afterwards, in May 2009, NRG Energy acquired the retail operations of Reliant Energy. With those two moves, NRG's holdings represented most of the former HL&P and today serve 1.6 million customers in Texas. The retail operations continue to operate under the Reliant Energy name while the remainder of the former Reliant Energy became RRI Energy.
Following the acquisition of Reliant, NRG extended its retail footprint with the acquisition of Green Mountain Energy in November 2010.[12] In doing so, NRG also became the largest retailer of green power in the nation, providing all of its Green Mountain and many of its Reliant customers with energy derived from 100% renewable resources.[13]
NRG Energy completed its acquisition of GenOn Energy in December 2012[1] for $1.7 billion in stock and cash.[14] The GenOn name was retired in the merger, but the combined company retained GenOn's Houston headquarters to coordinate operations.[1]
In August 2013, NRG acquired Energy Curtailment Specialists, a Buffalo, New York based Demand response company.[15] The terms of the deal were not disclosed [16]

In September 2014, NRG acquired Goal Zero, a manufacturer of personal solar power products.[17]
Naming rights[edit]
NRG Energy holds the naming rights to the NRG Park campus in Houston, Texas, home to the NRG Astrodome, NRG Stadium, NRG Arena and NRG Center.
On March 12, 2014, NRG Energy announced that they would be re-branding Reliant Park to replace "Reliant" on all signages to "NRG".
Wholesale generation[edit]
After the GenOn merger, NRG has 47,000 MW of total generation capacity, enough to power approximately 40 million homes.[18] Its nearly 100 power plants are located in 18 states in the Northeast, Chicago area, Gulf Coast, Southwest, Nevada, and California.[18] Generation facilities include mostly fossil fuel power plants powered by natural gas, oil, and coal; plus four wind farms (in Texas) and six solar farms (in California, Arizona, and New Mexico).[19] NRG also has a 44% ownership stake in the South Texas Nuclear Generating Station and a 37.5% stake in a coal power plant in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.[19] Some facilities use cogeneration and the company also owns 28MW of solar distributed generation.[19]
Retail electricity[edit]
NRG's Retail Power services provide electricity services to more than 2 million homes and businesses, mostly in Arizona and the Northeast.[citation needed]
Green energy initiatives[edit]




Nissan LEAF recharging from an EVgo network charging station in Houston, Texas


Beginning in 2009, NRG began an initiative to become an green energy producer in the United States and started investing money in clean energy projects.[20][21] They include onshore and offshore wind power, solar thermal energy, photovoltaic, and distributed solar power facilities, and repowering of some of their traditional coal plants with biomass.[20] In late 2010, NRG launched the "EVgo" network, the first completely private public car charging station network for electric power vehicles.[22]
The company signed a two-year agreement beginning in January 2011 to provide 100% renewable energy for the Empire State Building.[23][24]
Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas has been chair of a coalition to support the utility in their plan to replace its "decades-old, dirty" power plant in Astoria with a newer generator.[25] The company stated its intention in 2012 to replace 31 older oil generators with new gas generators that will increase the megawatts of power while reducing emissions.[25][26]

NRG Energy completed its acquisition of GenOn Energy in December 2012[1] for $1.7 billion in stock and cash.[14] The GenOn name was retired in the merger, but the combined company retained GenOn's Houston headquarters to coordinate operations.[1]
In August 2013, NRG acquired Energy Curtailment Specialists, a Buffalo, New York based Demand response company.[15] The terms of the deal were not disclosed [16]

In September 2014, NRG acquired Goal Zero, a manufacturer of personal solar power products.[17]
Naming rights[edit]
NRG Energy holds the naming rights to the NRG Park campus in Houston, Texas, home to the NRG Astrodome, NRG Stadium, NRG Arena and NRG Center.
On March 12, 2014, NRG Energy announced that they would be re-branding Reliant Park to replace "Reliant" on all signages to "NRG".
Wholesale generation[edit]
After the GenOn merger, NRG has 47,000 MW of total generation capacity, enough to power approximately 40 million homes.[18] Its nearly 100 power plants are located in 18 states in the Northeast, Chicago area, Gulf Coast, Southwest, Nevada, and California.[18] Generation facilities include mostly fossil fuel power plants powered by natural gas, oil, and coal; plus four wind farms (in Texas) and six solar farms (in California, Arizona, and New Mexico).[19] NRG also has a 44% ownership stake in the South Texas Nuclear Generating Station and a 37.5% stake in a coal power plant in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.[19] Some facilities use cogeneration and the company also owns 28MW of solar distributed generation.[19]
Retail electricity[edit]
NRG's Retail Power services provide electricity services to more than 2 million homes and businesses, mostly in Arizona and the Northeast.[citation needed]
Green energy initiatives[edit]

Beginning in 2009, NRG began an initiative to become an green energy producer in the United States and started investing money in clean energy projects.[20][21] They include onshore and offshore wind power, solar thermal energy, photovoltaic, and distributed solar power facilities, and repowering of some of their traditional coal plants with biomass.[20] In late 2010, NRG launched the "EVgo" network, the first completely private public car charging station network for electric power vehicles.[22]
The company signed a two-year agreement beginning in January 2011 to provide 100% renewable energy for the Empire State Building.[23][24]
Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas has been chair of a coalition to support the utility in their plan to replace its "decades-old, dirty" power plant in Astoria with a newer generator.[25] The company stated its intention in 2012 to replace 31 older oil generators with new gas generators that will increase the megawatts of power while reducing emissions.[25][26]

NRG Energy, Inc. is a large American energy company, dual-headquartered in West Windsor Township, New Jersey,[4][5] and Houston, Texas.[1][6][7] It was formerly the wholesale arm of Xcel Energy, and was spun off in bankruptcy in 2004.[8]

Acquisitions[edit]
When the state of Texas deregulated the electricity market, the former Houston Lighting & Power (HL&P) was split into several companies.[9] In 2003 HL&P was split into Texas Genco (which got the power plants), CenterPoint Energy (which got the distribution system) and Reliant Energy (which provided the electricity to business and individuals).[10]
In 2006, NRG Energy bought Texas Genco from a group of private equity firms for roughly $5.9 billion.[11] Afterwards, in May 2009, NRG Energy acquired the retail operations of Reliant Energy. With those two moves, NRG's holdings represented most of the former HL&P and today serve 1.6 million customers in Texas. The retail operations continue to operate under the Reliant Energy name while the remainder of the former Reliant Energy became RRI Energy.
Following the acquisition of Reliant, NRG extended its retail footprint with the acquisition of Green Mountain Energy in November 2010.[12] In doing so, NRG also became the largest retailer of green power in the nation, providing all of its Green Mountain and many of its Reliant customers with energy derived from 100% renewable resources.[13]
NRG Energy completed its acquisition of GenOn Energy in December 2012[1] for $1.7 billion in stock and cash.[14] The GenOn name was retired in the merger, but the combined company retained GenOn's Houston headquarters to coordinate operations.[1]
In August 2013, NRG acquired Energy Curtailment Specialists, a Buffalo, New York based Demand response company.[15] The terms of the deal were not disclosed [16]

In September 2014, NRG acquired Goal Zero, a manufacturer of personal solar power products.[17]
Naming rights[edit]
NRG Energy holds the naming rights to the NRG Park campus in Houston, Texas, home to the NRG Astrodome, NRG Stadium, NRG Arena and NRG Center.
On March 12, 2014, NRG Energy announced that they would be re-branding Reliant Park to replace "Reliant" on all signages to "NRG".
Wholesale generation[edit]
After the GenOn merger, NRG has 47,000 MW of total generation capacity, enough to power approximately 40 million homes.[18] Its nearly 100 power plants are located in 18 states in the Northeast, Chicago area, Gulf Coast, Southwest, Nevada, and California.[18] Generation facilities include mostly fossil fuel power plants powered by natural gas, oil, and coal; plus four wind farms (in Texas) and six solar farms (in California, Arizona, and New Mexico).[19] NRG also has a 44% ownership stake in the South Texas Nuclear Generating Station and a 37.5% stake in a coal power plant in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia.[19] Some facilities use cogeneration and the company also owns 28MW of solar distributed generation.[19]
Retail electricity[edit]
NRG's Retail Power services provide electricity services to more than 2 million homes and businesses, mostly in Arizona and the Northeast.[citation needed]
Green energy initiatives[edit]




Nissan LEAF recharging from an EVgo network charging station in Houston, Texas


Beginning in 2009, NRG began an initiative to become an green energy producer in the United States and started investing money in clean energy projects.[20][21] They include onshore and offshore wind power, solar thermal energy, photovoltaic, and distributed solar power facilities, and repowering of some of their traditional coal plants with biomass.[20] In late 2010, NRG launched the "EVgo" network, the first completely private public car charging station network for electric power vehicles.[22]
The company signed a two-year agreement beginning in January 2011 to provide 100% renewable energy for the Empire State Building.[23][24]
Assemblywoman Aravella Simotas has been chair of a coalition to support the utility in their plan to replace its "decades-old, dirty" power plant in Astoria with a newer generator.[25] The company stated its intention in 2012 to replace 31 older oil generators with new gas generators that will increase the megawatts of power while reducing emissions.[25][26]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
