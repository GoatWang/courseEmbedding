Description



A Selection of the History Book Club“Excellent.” —The Reader’s Review“Thomas Burns takes us thoroughly through this moment of crisis, giving us a precise analysis of the principal players in this period of transition.” —Military Illustrated“The book is well-written and throws new light on the events in the West a short while before the Fall of the Empire. Highly recommended!” —The Journal of Indo-European Studies“With this impressive study Burns has greatly enriched late antique scholarship.” —Religious Studies Review“This is a substantial and well documented book which has reminded me that the importance of reading is not so much to absorb facts, but to take in new ideas.” —Besprechungen und Anzeigen“What Burns has accomplished here is a thoroughly interesting and compelling study of late-medieval piety in one diocese. It may well serve as a model for other local historians willing to engage in this important inquiry.” —SpeculumA major work on Roman policy toward the barbarians during one of the most exciting and challenging periods in the history of the Roman Empire, when barbarian soldiers became part of the forces defending the Roman frontier and gradually its rulers. By the close of these five decades, the Western Empire—hence Western Civilization—had changed forever.

Product Description▼▲
Systematic theology seeks to understand and render more intelligible the central doctrines of faith and to show how they are related to each other. It tries to demonstrate how these doctrines are rooted in Scripture and develop in the history of the church; most important, it strives to more adequately express and sometimes reinterpret the church's doctrinal tradition, always in the interest of better communicating the mystery of salvation and bringing it into a dialogue with culture.The present text is intended to be concise and accessible, an introduction that explores basic themes in Catholic systematic theology from a biblical, historical, and contemporary perspective, always aware of today's theological pluralism.

Author Bio▼▲
Thomas P. Rausch, SJ, is the T. Marie Chilton Professor of Catholic Theology at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. A specialist in ecclesiology, he has published twenty books and numerous articles and has long been active in ecumenism. He co-chairs the Los Angeles Catholic/Evangelical Committee and the Theological Commission for the Archdiocese. From 2010 to 2014 he was a consultor to Jesuit Superior General Father Adolfo Nicholás for ecumenical affairs.


Editorial Reviews▼▲
"In the same clear and careful way that Richard McBrien helped Catholics of the 1980s understand the richness of their doctrinal tradition, Tom Rausch offers in this volume a way for Catholics to navigate that same tradition in this second decade of the twenty-first century. Rausch pays close attention, however, not only to the tradition's content but also to its context of postmodernity, cultural diversity, gender awareness, and sensitivity to sexual orientation. Although sometimes controversial, Rausch is always thorough and fair. This will be a helpful book for students and teachers alike."Stephen Bevans, SVD; Louis J. Luzbetak, SVD, Professor of Mission and Culture, Emeritus; Catholic Theological Union, Chicago
"Covering every major topic in Catholic theology with his signature accessibility and insight, this treatment of systematic theology is Thomas Rausch's chef d'oeuvre. Students and teachers looking for a reliable overview of historical and contemporary approaches to theology will find no single volume better than this."Michael Downey, editor of The New Dictionary of Catholic Spirituality
"Thomas P. Rausch, one of American Catholicism's finest writers, provides a solid introduction to the study of systematic theology, one that is attentive to its complex historical evolutions and contemporary face, while taking seriously its faith-filled, ecclesial, and contextual character. Educators and students alike will welcome his balanced presentation of the plurality of contemporary systematic theologies that carry forward the pastoral effort of mediating the meaning of a life in communion-with the Christian God, with other human persons in the church and society, and with the whole of creation-to the women and men of our time."Catherine E. Clifford, Saint Paul University, Ottawa
"Rausch has produced a first-rate introduction to Catholic systematic theology. This book provides a cogent and up-to-date summary of the conversation in every major branch of systematic theology while also explaining the methods, biblical bases, historical development, and ecumenical perspectives that inform the debates. Rausch's writing is clear and engaging, making this text an excellent book for undergraduates. At the same time, it provides substantive contributions useful to advanced scholars. This book should be the top choice for anyone who wants to get the lay of the land' in contemporary Catholic theology."Mary Doak, Associate Professor, Theology and Religious Studies, University of San Diego
"Thomas Rausch is a masterful teacher. With this book he offers a clear, well-informed introduction to contemporary Catholic systematic theology. Rausch insightfully maps its key areas, major figures, and frontier issues."Robert P. Imbelli, Associate Professor of Theology Emeritus, Boston College, Author of Rekindling the Christic Imagination
"Informed and informative, thoughtful and thought-provoking, descriptively explanatory and instructively illuminating. . . . Highly recommended for clergy, seminary, and academic library Christian studies collections."James A. Cox, The Midwest Book Review
"In this very readable text, Father Tom Rausch succeeds in offering a clear and balanced treatment of this complex and challenging material."Catholic Library World
"He writes for those who need both a horizon tour of systematics and a first glance at those writers who have addressed themselves to the main themes in systematic theology. I could see this book to be a serviceable handbook for those beginning theological studies at the level of the master's degree. Along with the helpful reading suggestions at the end of each chapter, the book has a quite thorough index of names and topics."Lawrence S. Cunningham, University of Notre Dame, Worship

Overview
Centuries after the fall of Rome, the only means by which we can learn from one of the greatest empires is through its surviving pieces. While Appian draws from other historians and writers, his Roman History remains the only surviving account of the Roman civil wars, the period between the reigns of Polybius and Cicero, and the third Punic War and destruction of Carthage. Like many ancient historians, Appian gives a rare glimpse into the psyches, ideologies, and moralities of key people through speeches he himself constructed. To the modern historian, this creative license contaminates the facts, while to the ancient historian, conveying the political intentions and moral principles that inspired the world’s great leaders were every bit as important as the facts themselves. While his sources are not formally provided, scholars conclude from references within his writings that Appian’s original sources likely include the works of Polybius, Paulus Claudius, Hieronymus, Caesar Augustus, and Asinius Pollio.
Of the original 24 books of Appian’s Roman History, only half have survived. Those that remain provide invaluable insight into Roman culture, politics, and history found nowhere else. Appian picks up where Dionysius leaves off, diving into the Punic Wars in volume 1, and ending with the civil wars.
This collection contains the complete texts in their Loeb Classical Library editions. Each text is included in its original Greek, with an English translation for easy side-by-side comparison. Logos’ language tools help you to go deeper into the Greek text and explore Appian’s elegant language. Use the dictionary lookup tool to examine difficult Greek words and find every use of the same word in your library. Students of history and anthropology will enjoy these works and appreciate their significance.

Praise for the Print Edition

About Appian
Appian of Alexandria (AD c. 95–165) was a Greek Roman historian living during the time of emperors Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius. Not much is known about his life beyond what can be gathered from his own writings. He references an autobiography which was not preserved with his historical works. A letter from his friend Fronto advocates for Appian’s appointment as procurator, “not to gratify his ambition, or for the sake of the pay, but as a merited distinction in his old age.” Over the centuries, Appian’s writings have proved to be invaluable pieces of history.
About Horace White
Horace White (1834–1916) was an author, editor, translator, journalist, and financial expert. He graduated Beloit College in 1853 and went on to become city editor of the Chicago Evening Journal. White had the privilege of working with Abraham Lincoln as he campaigned against Stephen A. Douglas. In 1899, White became the editor in chief of the New York Evening Post and The Nation. He authored Money and Banking Illustrated by American History and Life of Lyman Trumbull, and he edited Sophismes Économiques by Frédéric Bastiat and Scienza Delle Finanze by Luigi Cossa. He died after being hit by an automobile in 1916.

BurnsJHU Press, Sep 8, 2003 - History - 461 pages 0 Reviewshttps://books.google.com/books/about/Rome_and_the_Barbarians_100_B_C_A_D_400.html?id=PaRNJOLnRMUCThe barbarians of antiquity, so long a fixture of the public imagination as the savages who sacked and destroyed Rome, emerge in this colorful, richly textured history as a much more complex—and far more interesting—factor in the expansion, and eventual unmaking, of the Roman Empire. Thomas S. Burns marshals an abundance of archeological and literary evidence, as well as three decades of study and experience, to bring forth an unusually far-sighted and wide-ranging account of the relations between Romans and non-Romans along the frontiers of western Europe from the last years of the Republic into late antiquity.Looking at a 500-year time span beginning with early encounters between barbarians and Romans around 100 B.C. and ending with the spread of barbarian settlement in the western Empire around A.D. 400, Burns removes the barbarians from their narrow niche as invaders and conquerors and places them in the broader context of neighbors, (sometimes bitter) friends, and settlers. His nuanced history subtly shows how Rome's relations with the barbarians—and vice versa—slowly but inexorably evolved from general ignorance, hostility, and suspicion toward tolerance, synergy, and integration. What he describes is, in fact, a drawn-out period of acculturation, characterized more by continuity than by change and conflict and leading to the creation of a new Romano-barbarian hybrid society and culture that anticipated the values and traditions of medieval civilization.  Preview this book » What people are saying - Write a reviewWe haven't found any reviews in the usual places.Selected pagesTitle PageIndexReferencesContentsSometimes Bitter Friends1 Recognition Confrontation and Coexistence42 Through Caesars Eyes88 The Early Empire and the Barbarians An Overview140 Perspectives from Pannonia194 The Barbarians and the Crisis of the Empire248 Barbarians and the Late Roman Empire309 Epilogue374 Most Important Roman Emperors and Usurpers385 Notes391 Bibliography431 Index453 Copyright Other editions - View allRome and the Barbarians, 100 B.C.–A.D. 400Thomas S.
