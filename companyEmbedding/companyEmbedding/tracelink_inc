NORTH READING, Mass., May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- TraceLink Inc., the World's Largest Track and Trace Network for connecting the life sciences supply chain and eliminating counterfeit prescription drugs from the global marketplace, today unveiled the industry's first Network Product Master Data Service, providing any U.S. dispenser using Product Track software with access to the largest network-sourced prescription drug and product master data repository.The new Network Product Master Data Service is designed to address a unique and persistent challenge that health systems, hospitals, and pharmacies face when attempting to successfully process DSCSA T3 (Transaction History, Statement, and Information) compliance documentation for prescription drug shipments that are missing required NDC (National Drug Code) information and other critical data. Updating prescription drug records with the correct information can be challenging for hospitals and pharmacies that do not have internal systems in place to regularly maintain product master data, nor the full-time staff to process corrections for shipments with missing information. TraceLink's new Network Product Master Data Service removes the internal burden of managing product master data by allowing any dispenser to:Submit data for inclusion in TraceLink's NDC and product master data management system  contributing to the only network-sourced, continuously expanding repository of NDC and prescription drug product master data with quality assurance checks performed by TraceLink's network services team for every submission;
Automate the process of validating NDC and product master data during the product receiving process  using Product Track to search for missing information among the hundreds of thousands of NDCs in the FDA database, RED BOOK, and in the TraceLink Life Sciences Cloud network of products traded between more than 250,000 supply chain partners; and,  
Contribute to and source GTIN information for future serialized products from TraceLink and non-TraceLink customers  at no additional cost  to be used seamlessly by all TraceLink customers including CMOs, repackagers, wholesalers, hospitals and pharmacies.As users submit information to the Network Product Master Data Service and its database grows in size, all TraceLink customers benefit from having larger and larger volumes of NDCs and product master data that Product Track will use in an attempt to append missing information during the verification process. "Our work with hundreds of hospitals and pharmacies that manage compliance for over 4,200 dispensing locations in the U.S. has revealed that critical data gaps make it very difficult to efficiently create documentation needed to achieve DSCSA compliance," said Shabbir Dahod, president and CEO, TraceLink. "TraceLink is the only company capable of addressing this challenge head on because of our unique network model. Dispensers simply submit missing NDC and product master data to us, we manage that data for them, and everyone on the TraceLink network benefits as that data becomes part of the growing repository that we check whenever customers need to append shipments with information that is required."  Additional Product Track Enhancements: NDC Verification ServiceOf the millions of dispenser transactions that TraceLink processes from wholesale distributors, many often include DSCSA-exempt items, such as over-the-counter (OTC) medicines and other medical supplies. With support from major U.S. wholesalers, TraceLink has introduced a new NDC Verification Service within its Product Track software that eases the burden of filtering large product volumes to determine what falls under DSCSA. When customers use Product Track, the new NDC Verification Service will:Exclude OTC and other non-prescription drug products from the T3 creation process  when receiving  shipments from major US wholesalers that use a "DSCSA exempt flag;"
Utilize TraceLink's Network Product Master Data Service to check for missing NDCs  against FDA and RED BOOK databases and  the TraceLink Life Sciences Cloud network of products traded between more than 250,000 supply chain partners;
Generate T3 for all products with legitimate NDCs  using an "information icon" to identify any products that could not be verified through TraceLink's Network Product Master Data Service and may require additional information before processing;
Allow dispensers to add missing NDC data and reprocess transaction records with a single click  at time of receipt or at a later date, based on SOPs defined by the dispenser; and,
Support future product verification against manufacturer GTINs  at no additional charge to facilitate receipt of future serialized product.Digital Conversion of Paper T3  Opt-In, Premium ServiceAs DSCSA phases in over a 10-year period, all segments in the supply chain will have to manage digital transactions through an electronic interoperable system by 2023. To reduce the operational workload for hospitals and pharmacies that receive high volumes of paper T3 but do not have the resources to convert these documents to the digital format,  TraceLink has launched a new premium subscription service that creates digital versions of all paper T3 documents through a quick upload in Product Track. While market availability for this premium service is expected by mid-2017, early adopters can sign up for the program now, and if selected, receive a 50% discount on the first year of service. Annual subscription pricing for the service will be based on an evaluation of the volume of paper transactions to be converted.

NORTH READING, Mass., June 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- TraceLink Inc., the World's Largest Track and Trace Network for connecting the life sciences supply chain and providing real-time information sharing for better patient outcomes, today announced end-to-end administration services for U.S. hospitals and pharmacies that use its proven Product Track transaction history management software to meet the compliance requirements of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). On July 1st, TraceLink will begin transitioning its 350+ healthcare customers to Product Track with End-to-End Administration, which will be bundled into their existing TraceLink subscription at no extra cost. Additionally, through TraceLink's expansive network of alliances with group purchasing organizations (GPOs), covering more than 90 percent of the entire U.S. hospital market, GPO member hospitals and pharmacies can take advantage of special pricing and pre-negotiated terms for TraceLink Product Track with End-to-End Administration. Every customer who subscribes to Product Track will now benefit from a set of end-to-end administration services provided by TraceLink that are designed to eliminate the time-intensive tasks of managing product, partner and company master data, exceptions, paper-to-digital processing, continuous quality control checks, and document preparation for audits. As a result, hospitals and pharmacies are able to increase the time they spend providing care to patients by offloading all of their DSCSA compliance requirements to a dedicated team of TraceLink service and compliance experts."In working closely with the hospitals and pharmacies that use our products daily to manage lot-level transaction histories at thousands of dispensing locations, many have expressed an interest in having TraceLink remove additional time consuming tasks that DSCSA has introduced into their pharmacy operations," said Shabbir Dahod, president and CEO of TraceLink. "We've responded by expanding our current solution to eliminate the time that healthcare providers need to spend on maintaining master data, adding new trading partners, and resolving exceptions. Going forward, TraceLink will assume all of these responsibilities  at no incremental cost  so that pharmacists and clinicians can do what they do best: provide consultative care to their patients."TraceLink Product Track with End-to-End Administration: How It WorksTraceLink Product Track is the transaction history management system used by more U.S. hospitals and pharmacies to achieve DSCSA compliance than any other solution. The software runs on a single platform that connects to prescription drug suppliers and processes all pharmacy-related DSCSA compliance information.Product Track with End-to-End Administration leverages TraceLink staff who shoulder the full workload associated with compliance-related tasks for hospitals and pharmacies, including:Adding and maintaining any missing product master data  for drug products that are purchased by a pharmacy. Adding, removing, and maintaining any partners  with whom an organization works to purchase drug products. Adding or removing company locations  to cover all dispensing locations within the same operation. Adding or removing new users, or changing user access permissions  as staffing needs evolve and new users need to use the Product Track software. Active maintenance and monitoring of exceptions  that occur as a result of receiving POs or ASNs from suppliers with missing information required by DSCSA. Reprocessing any necessary transactions  after researching exceptions and validating that Product Track information is accurate and compliant. Utilizing TraceLink's unique and proprietary "network-sourced" NDC database  to continuously update new NDCs that are discovered across the TraceLink Network, an exclusive benefit to TraceLink customers. Manually entering required DSCSA data to create digital T3 from user scanned or uploaded paper documents  then appending the originally-scanned PO to ensure a fully-compliant, all-digital database of T3s. Actively monitor data quality, and provide full customer support during an inquiry  if a Request for Information is initiated by a regulatory authority, to ensure that the customer can supply the required compliance information within the 48-hour business response time.

The first phase of US DSCSA is now in effect. If you haven't begun planning for serialization, you're already behind.
 Now that the first phase of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) is in effect, you may have learned that
    an ASN and paper approach for drug tracing, verification and archiving was more difficult than you thought. Or you might not be sure
    how exception management will work when you get a shipment that doesn't match the information on the ASN.  

The next DSCSA phase increases     in complexity, with specific serialization and verification regulations that will require many months – even years – of planning and testing prior     to implementation. 

It's time to get started. 
 Learn More  
  






The Falsified Medicines Directive takes effect across  the European Union in 2018.
 The European Union has introduced the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD), and serialization requirements take effect in most EU countries beginning in 2019.  

The Directive will affect the entire pharmaceutical industry, from manufacturers and generics producers to wholesalers and distributors. 

Packaging and distribution processes must be changed. Physical equipment must be procured and operationalized. Enterprise-wide IT must be implemented. End-to-end serialization testing with supply chain partners must take place. 
 Learn More  
  






Brazil’s revised serialization and compliance reporting bill is now law. What’s next? 
 In December 2016, Brazil’s new track and trace law was officially signed and published, amending the previous law. After ANVISA finalizes regulatory rules, Brazil’s     3-phase implementation schedule will begin – as early as May 2017.

This comprehensive new regulation mandates that each medicine pack's serialized identity be captured, along with each transaction     event as product moves through the supply chain, from manufacturer to dispenser. In addition, these     events must be reported to a centralized National Medication Control System.
 Learn More  
  






China expands serialization beyond the National Essential Drugs List  to all drugs by December 2015.
 In 2013, TraceLink launched the first, integrated end-to-end serialization and government reporting
    solution to enable pharmaceutical companies and contract manufacturers comply with China's 2009/2012 National Essential Drugs List. 


By December 31, 2015, China’s track and trace laws mandate serialization, event tracking from production
    through distribution, and compliance reporting to the China CFDA for all pharmaceuticals.  Learn More  
  






India now requires that mono cartons be treated as secondary level packaging. 
 The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) in India initiated barcoding and serialization of tertiary level packaging in 2011, and secondary level packaging in 2013. 

The DGFT now has new requirements for mono cartons, which contain strips, vials or bottles of pharmaceutical
    products. 
Although mono cartons were earlier to be treated as part of primary level packaging, they are now to be treated as secondary level packaging, introducing new complexities for the pharmaceutical supply chain.  Learn More  
  






South Korea reporting expands to all manufacturers by July 1, 2016.
 South Korea’s Ministry of Health and Welfare now requires serialization for 100% of products produced and sold into the South Korea supply chain. 

By the July 1, 2016 enforcement deadline, serialized product supply reporting will also begin for all pharmaceutical     companies.  

South Korea plans to require serialization reporting by wholesale distributors beginning July 1, 2017.
 Learn More  
  






Achieving compliance in Turkey requires DataMatrix codes for serialization.
 Since 2012, TraceLink has been helping Life Sciences companies to track and trace pharmaceutical products in Turkey in accordance with the pharmaceutical track and trace system – known as ITS – established by the Turkish government. 

ITS requires DataMatrix codes for serialization to ensure the authenticity of pharmaceutical units. 

As a result, ITS collects information about all of the steps and transactions that occur for individual drugs as they move through the supply chain.

Although Argentina’s regulations are in effect,the final timeline for full product compliance is still pending. 
 Argentina chose to phase in their coming regulations by product type, with the first drug groups meeting a 2012 deadline.  By global timeline standards, Argentina was a relatively early compliance adopter. 

Regulatory agency ANMAT has yet  to announce the date, though, by which all pharmaceuticals must be covered by the country's
serialization and reporting requirements.  Until then, a significant share of product dispensed in Argentina remains unregulated.

The Most Proven Track and Trace Solution to Ensure Drug Supply
 By 2019, 75% of the world's prescription drugs    will be covered by track and trace laws.  


The TraceLink Life Sciences Cloud is the only proven, end-to-end digital supply chain network that enables you to securely exchange an unprecedented volume of regulated information with all your trade partners.   

Over 330 supply chain companies already depend on it to meet global compliance requirements on time.  That's more track and trace customers than any other solution on the market.    Find Out More  











Safeguard the integrity of every medication you manufacture.
 Consumers place unconditional trust in every prescription medication they take. When tainted or counterfeit medicines surface, pharmaceutical companies are the first in question –
     regardless of when or where the breach occurred.  
     

The Life Sciences Cloud gives pharmaceutical companies complete supply chain visibility. 

Track and trace every product  and all of the compliance data associated with it, as it travels from your     facility through your trade partner network, and to the pharmacy or hospital that will dispense it. Anytime, anywhere.   Learn More  
  






Facilitate compliance while continuing to grow your business.
 With more pharmaceuticals virtualizing operations, contract manufacturers and packagers play an increasingly large role in the supply chain. As serialization comes into play, that means you face increasingly big collaboration challenges. 
You must pass serialization data to the pharmaceutical companies that are ultimately responsible for meeting the regulations.  
TraceLink's Life Sciences Cloud reduces the data exchange challenge to one simple connection. With seamless information sharing, products remain in compliance and your business continues to thrive.   Learn More   
  






Agile regulatory coverage. For all the wholesale products you purchase and distribute.
 As a wholesale distributor, you face new and emerging compliance regulations in nearly every country. How you manage these requirements, while maintaining operational efficiency with your upstream suppliers and downstream buyers, is paramount to your success.
 
Joining the Life Sciences Cloud network gives wholesalers complete connectivity to all of their supply chain partners.  
TraceLink manages every compliance transaction for you, so that you stay focused on running your business and preventing disruption in the flow of critical medicine through the supply chain.

Preserve your brand reputation for quality and excellence in repackaging.
 Drug repackagers are extremely careful and meticulous when altering prescription dosage levels for physicians and pharmacies. Their brand reputations depend on ensuring that the right amount of medication reaches the right patient at the right time. 
If you’re a repackager, new global laws require you to conform to new standards, but you don’t have to face the challenge alone.  
TraceLink handles regulatory supply chain compliance requirements for repackagers, allowing you to keep your diligence on accurately consolidating drug quantities and supplying them to your customers.  Learn More  
  






Invest more time with your pharmacy patients. Let TraceLink shoulder your entire DSCSA workload.
 
Working with more than 4,000 dispensing locations across the US has taught us that handling DSCSA compliance effectively can get in the way of providing
        patient care.
With TraceLink, long DSCSA "to-do" lists for pharmacy buyers, technicians, and administrators are a thing of the past – because we take care of it
        all. Product, partner and company master data. Exceptions. Paper-to-digital processing. Continuous quality control checks. We even prepare documents
        in case of an audit.
Leave DSCSA compliance to the dedicated team of TraceLink service and compliance experts used by the most US hospitals and pharmacies. And we'll let
        you do what you do best: Deliver the highest quality care to your patients.

TraceLink Announces End-to-End Administration for Product Track for U.S. Hospitals and Pharmacies
June 26, 2017
TraceLink Inc., the World’s Largest Track and Trace Network for connecting the life sciences supply chain and providing real-time information sharing for
    better patient outcomes, today announced end-to-end administration services for U.S. hospitals and pharmacies    that use its proven Product Track transaction history management software to meet the compliance requirements of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act
    (DSCSA). 
On July 1st, TraceLink will begin transitioning its 350+ healthcare customers to Product Track with End-to-End Administration, which will be bundled into
    their existing TraceLink subscription at no extra cost. Additionally, through TraceLink’s expansive network of alliances with group purchasing organizations
    (GPOs), covering more than 90 percent of the entire U.S. hospital market, GPO member hospitals and pharmacies can take advantage of special pricing
    and pre-negotiated terms for TraceLink Product Track with End-to-End Administration. 
Every customer who subscribes to Product Track will now benefit from a set of end-to-end administration services provided by TraceLink that are designed
    to eliminate the time-intensive tasks of managing product, partner and company master data, exceptions, paper-to-digital processing, continuous quality
    control checks, and document preparation for audits. As a result, hospitals and pharmacies are able to increase the time they spend providing care
    to patients by offloading all of their DSCSA compliance requirements to a dedicated team of TraceLink service and compliance experts.
“In working closely with the hospitals and pharmacies that use our products daily to manage lot-level transaction histories at thousands of dispensing
    locations, many have expressed an interest in having TraceLink remove additional time consuming tasks that DSCSA has introduced into their pharmacy
    operations,” said Shabbir Dahod, president and CEO of TraceLink. “We’ve responded by expanding our current solution to eliminate the time that healthcare
    providers need to spend on maintaining master data, adding new trading partners, and resolving exceptions. Going forward, TraceLink will assume all
    of these responsibilities – at no incremental cost – so that pharmacists and clinicians can do what they do best: provide consultative care to their
    patients.”
TraceLink Product Track with End-to-End Administration: How It Works

 TraceLink Product Track is the transaction history management system used by more U.S. hospitals and pharmacies to achieve DSCSA
    compliance than any other solution. The software runs on a single platform that connects to prescription drug suppliers and processes all pharmacy-related
    DSCSA compliance information.
Product Track with End-to-End Administration leverages TraceLink staff who shoulder the full workload associated with compliance-related tasks for hospitals
    and pharmacies, including:
Adding and maintaining any missing product master data – for drug products that are purchased by a pharmacy.
Adding, removing, and maintaining any partners – with whom an organization works to purchase drug products.
Adding or removing company locations – to cover all dispensing locations within the same operation.
Adding or removing new users, or changing user access permissions – as staffing needs evolve and new users need to use the Product Track
    software.
Active maintenance and monitoring of exceptions – that occur as a result of receiving POs or ASNs from suppliers with missing information
    required by DSCSA.
Reprocessing any necessary transactions – after researching exceptions and validating that Product Track information is accurate and compliant.
Utilizing TraceLink’s unique and proprietary “network-sourced” NDC database – to continuously update new NDCs that are discovered across
    the TraceLink Network, an exclusive benefit to TraceLink customers.
Manually entering required DSCSA data to create digital T3 from user scanned or uploaded paper documents – then appending the originally-scanned
    PO to ensure a fully-compliant, all-digital database of T3s.
Actively monitor data quality, and provide full customer support during an inquiry – if a Request for Information is initiated by a regulatory
    authority, to ensure that the customer can supply the required compliance information within the 48-hour business response time.

TraceLink Announces End-to-End Administration For Product Track, Alleviating Time-Intensive DSCSA Compliance Tasks For U.S. Hospitals And Pharmacies









PR Newswire




Jun 26, 2017 9:00 AM EDT













 


















































  NORTH READING, Mass., June 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --  TraceLink Inc., the World's Largest Track and Trace Network for connecting the life sciences supply chain and providing real-time information sharing for better patient outcomes, today announced end-to-end administration services for U.S. hospitals and pharmacies that use its proven Product Track transaction history management software to meet the compliance requirements of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). On July 1st, TraceLink will begin transitioning its 350+ healthcare customers to Product Track with End-to-End Administration, which will be bundled into their existing TraceLink subscription at no extra cost. Additionally, through TraceLink's expansive network of alliances with group purchasing organizations (GPOs), covering more than 90 percent of the entire U.S. hospital market, GPO member hospitals and pharmacies can take advantage of special pricing and pre-negotiated terms for TraceLink Product Track with End-to-End Administration. Every customer who subscribes to Product Track will now benefit from a set of end-to-end administration services provided by TraceLink that are designed to eliminate the time-intensive tasks of managing product, partner and company master data, exceptions, paper-to-digital processing, continuous quality control checks, and document preparation for audits. As a result, hospitals and pharmacies are able to increase the time they spend providing care to patients by offloading all of their DSCSA compliance requirements to a dedicated team of TraceLink service and compliance experts. "In working closely with the hospitals and pharmacies that use our products daily to manage lot-level transaction histories at thousands of dispensing locations, many have expressed an interest in having TraceLink remove additional time consuming tasks that DSCSA has introduced into their pharmacy operations," said Shabbir Dahod, president and CEO of TraceLink. "We've responded by expanding our current solution to eliminate the time that healthcare providers need to spend on maintaining master data, adding new trading partners, and resolving exceptions. Going forward, TraceLink will assume all of these responsibilities - at no incremental cost - so that pharmacists and clinicians can do what they do best: provide consultative care to their patients."  TraceLink Product Track with End-to-End Administration: How It Works TraceLink Product Track is the transaction history management system used by more U.S. hospitals and pharmacies to achieve DSCSA compliance than any other solution. The software runs on a single platform that connects to prescription drug suppliers and processes all pharmacy-related DSCSA compliance information.

TraceLink Product Track with End-to-End Administration: How It Works
TraceLink Product Track is the transaction history management system used by more U.S. hospitals and pharmacies to achieve DSCSA compliance than any other solution. The software runs on a single platform that connects to prescription drug suppliers and processes all pharmacy-related DSCSA compliance information.
Product Track with End-to-End Administration leverages TraceLink staff who shoulder the full workload associated with compliance-related tasks for hospitals and pharmacies, including:

Adding and maintaining any missing product master data – for drug products that are purchased by a pharmacy. 
Adding, removing, and maintaining any partners – with whom an organization works to purchase drug products. 
Adding or removing company locations – to cover all dispensing locations within the same operation. 
Adding or removing new users, or changing user access permissions – as staffing needs evolve and new users need to use the Product Track software. 
Active maintenance and monitoring of exceptions – that occur as a result of receiving POs or ASNs from suppliers with missing information required by DSCSA. 
Reprocessing any necessary transactions – after researching exceptions and validating that Product Track information is accurate and compliant. 
Utilizing TraceLink's unique and proprietary "network-sourced" NDC database – to continuously update new NDCs that are discovered across the TraceLink Network, an exclusive benefit to TraceLink customers. 
Manually entering required DSCSA data to create digital T3 from user scanned or uploaded paper documents – then appending the originally-scanned PO to ensure a fully-compliant, all-digital database of T3s. 
Actively monitor data quality, and provide full customer support during an inquiry – if a Request for Information is initiated by a regulatory authority, to ensure that the customer can supply the required compliance information within the 48-hour business response time.

Company Overview










TraceLink works with life sciences supply chain companies to protect patients and save lives, transforming the way that the industry does business
                with innovative track and trace solutions. TraceLink is dedicated to helping our customers – from 16 of the top 20 global pharmaceutical
                companies to corner pharmacies – enable the global distribution of safe drugs and achieve compliance in the most cost effective way.
Today’s Life Sciences Supply Chain and Global Regulations
In today’s life sciences supply chain, illicit activity is thriving: the counterfeit drug market generates 75 billion dollars of business and
                kills hundreds of thousands of people each year. More than 40 countries have responded with new laws that will, by late 2018, regulate
                75% of the world’s prescription medications as they travel through the supply chain.
To achieve compliance, supply chain participants must master the unique track and trace requirements for each country in which they do business;
                implement a system capable of generating, managing, and storing unprecedented volumes of regulated data; and exchange that data with trade
                partners and government agencies. 
The TraceLink Life Sciences Cloud
To help the industry succeed TraceLink introduced the Life Sciences Cloud, which has quickly become the world’s largest pharmaceutical track
                and trace network. TraceLink’s platform is purpose-built for serialization and enables a whole new dimension of collaboration, transforming
                the way that supply chain companies interoperate while seamlessly maintaining compliance.
The TraceLink Life Sciences Cloud is built on Amazon Web Services’ native cloud architecture with a network-tenant platform to deliver scalability,
                performance, and business-to business connectivity. A single point and click connection to the Life Sciences Cloud allows any company to
                gain complete global connectivity with all of their trading partners. The Life Sciences Cloud neutralizes data format and transport preferences,
                seamlessly delivering compliance information to partners regardless of specific system capabilities. It also automatically distributes
                scheduled software updates necessitated by regulatory changes, resulting in uninterrupted customer compliance.
There are more than 200,000 supply chain companies on the TraceLink network today, including pharmaceutical businesses, wholesale distributors,
                contract manufacturers and packagers, 3PLs, hospitals, pharmacies, and other dispensing entities. The TraceLink Life Sciences Cloud is
                a proven solution: to date, it has already processed 60.6 million US DSCSA Transaction Histories and managed 2.37 billion serialized events
                to meet multiple markets’ needs. TraceLink provides tailor-made solutions for regulatory requirements in countries around the world, including

United States' Track and Trace Regulations Overview
The full complement of US requirements phases in between 2015 and 2023, with challenges for all supply chain companies at different points along the
    way.
With the 2015 Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) lot-level traceability deadline behind us, pharmaceutical companies have turned their attention to
    full drug serialization. DSCSA requires that manufacturers mark packages with a product identifier, serial number, lot number, and expiration date
    by November 2017. Given everything that needs to happen by then, from altering highly regulated packaging and distribution processes to addressing
    enterprise-wide IT, pharma companies should be well on their way to readiness. At the same time, wholesale distributors and other supply chain companies
    will perform end-to-end serialization testing with their manufacturing partners in advance of the deadline to allow time for any necessary adjustments.
Product Tracing, Verification and Serialization Highlights
Product Tracing – By January 2015 pharmaceutical companies and wholesale distributors needed to achieve lot-based traceability,
    which involves sharing a Transaction History with every partner to whom you sell product. For many companies, establishing the necessary infrastructure
    for communication with partners at the level you need for regulatory compliance was the biggest challenge. In addition, the law does not prescribe
    standard formats for data exchange, so companies need to be equipped to receive transaction data in many configurations. 
By July 2015, dispensers needed to be able to receive and archive T3 information, and be prepared to produce it in the event of an inquiry.
When serialization comes into play, product tracking will still be required but the nature of the requirement changes. Track and trace and serialization
    requirements will finally converge in 2023. 
    

Verification –In the event of a suspect product inquiry, supply chain companies must be able to produce the relevant transaction
    documentation within twenty-four hours (dispensers have forty-eight). The challenge is in being able to locate and access the necessary records in
    this tight turnaround time. Businesses need a storage and retrieval mechanism that supports these queries. 
Serialization – During lot level preparation, the industry discovered that completing one transaction between two parties was
    challenging. When serialization with its end-to-end tracing takes effect, businesses will need to manage many transactions, involving billions of items,
    with tens to hundreds of partners, including outsourcing ones. So there is the supply chain communication challenge but there is also a data volume
    challenge as businesses generate, process, and store an unprecedented amount of data and transactions. In the US the smallest saleable unit and the
    sealed homogenous case need to be serialized. By law, aggregation is not required but there is speculation that it will be required at some future
    point.
Manufacturers must serialize by November 2017. The rest of the supply chain has more time before they need to make full use of the serial numbers, but
    there will be circumstances prior to that in which they need to interact with the serial number, like for product returns and suspect product investigations. 
How TraceLink Can Help
TraceLink is the World's Largest Track and Trace Network for connecting the life sciences supply chain and eliminating counterfeit prescription drugs from
    the global marketplace.  We have worked with more than 500 customers, from all segments of the supply chain, on their compliance strategies. That
    deep, collective experience informs our approach in every conversation. 
The TraceLink Life Sciences Cloud, where we have more than 247,000 supply chain members, has commissioned more than 150 million serial numbers in 2016
    alone and processed 184 million Transaction Histories overall.  The network enables you to interoperate with all of the businesses on it, seamlessly
    exchanging data and collaborating on key business processes. We accept any data type and translate into a canonical format, neutralizing one of the
    key challenges of DSCSA. We also have mechanisms in place to manage exception handling, which is quickly proving to be a significant challenge
    in the compliance landscape. And as your serialization production, events, and archiving needs grow, our Life Sciences Cloud    scales with you, eliminating the need to worry about storage and computer processing capacity.  
The TraceLink platform meets your US compliance needs. If you operate internationally, it can help you manage your regulatory requirements in all of your
    markets, allowing you to focus on one global track and trace solution.

Shabbir Dahod
President and CEO
Fueling the vision of an industry-transforming business in the life sciences.


Shabbir Dahod is President and Chief Executive Officer of TraceLink and a member of the company’s board of directors. He co-founded the company in 2009
    with a vision of building a business that will transform how life science companies manage the manufacturing, packaging, distribution, and dispensing
    of pharmaceutical products across a network of trading partners in the global life sciences supply chain.
 
For well over a decade, Dahod has dedicated himself to pharmaceutical supply chain integrity, making it his mission to protect patients around the world.
    As a true visionary, Dahod recognized early on where and how traceability technology could be used to strengthen the life sciences supply chain and
    make a significant impact on saving lives, years before the US and 40 other countries around the world began mandating a tightening of the drug distribution
    system. In the early 2000s, while working with MIT Auto-ID Labs (which germinated the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) in 1999), he was alerted
    to a series of incidents where counterfeit drugs made their way to unsuspecting patients across the US Moved by the gravity of human lives at stake,
    and immersed in IoT research, Dahod had the idea to lift the journey of a pharmaceutical product up into the digital cloud; its footprint would be
    managed digitally, thereby securing the passage of safe medicines from manufacturer to patient and all steps in between.
 
A few years before the US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) became law, Dahod launched TraceLink and introduced the Life Sciences Cloud, a cloud-based
    software hosted by Amazon Web Services that has become the world’s largest track and trace network for the life sciences supply chain. His passion
    for cutting-edge technology and business model innovation was the driving force behind what is now the de-facto industry standard for meeting time-bound
    global regulatory compliance requirements and protecting patients across the globe from the threat of counterfeit medicines.
 
Dahod says, "At TraceLink, we are blending decades of knowledge in technology, life sciences, and supply chain business process with a revolutionary approach
    to digitally transform the life sciences supply chain. My contribution is to leverage 32 years of experience in engineering, product innovation, and
    business strategy, in order to provide our customers with a proven software solution that enables our customers to exchange critical data with their
    network of trade partners while easing the burden of complying with global track and trace regulations. "
 
Early in his career, Dahod worked with Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen at his Seattle-based startup, Asymetrix, where he established the company as a leader
    in Multimedia Authoring technology in the computer based learning market. With Allen, Dahod researched and incubated a number of emerging web-based
    products and technologies, including early initiatives in e-commerce, natural language query, online sports, digital media, and Java development tools.
    He eventually served as a Senior Executive of the Paul Allen group of companies, and later joined Microsoft as a Senior Leader to spearhead collaboration
    and knowledge management efforts using emerging XML standards and new Internet communication tools. 
 
Dahod holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in computer science from Boston University.

    team member, and under his guidance the company is seeing accelerating momentum and a remarkable increase in revenue, customer growth, and employee

Shabbir Dahod
TraceLink
 
Shabbir Dahod is President and Chief Executive Officer of TraceLink and a member of the company’s board of directors. He co-founded the company in 2009
    with a vision of building a business that will transform how life science companies manage the manufacturing, packaging, distribution, and dispensing
    of pharmaceutical products across a network of trading partners in the global life sciences supply chain.
     
For well over a decade, Dahod has dedicated himself to pharmaceutical supply chain integrity, making it his mission to protect patients around the world.
    As a true visionary, Dahod recognized early on where and how traceability technology could be used to strengthen the life sciences supply chain and
    make a significant impact on saving lives, years before the US and 40 other countries around the world began mandating a tightening of the drug distribution
    system. In the early 2000s, while working with MIT Auto-ID Labs (which germinated the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) in 1999), he was alerted
    to a series of incidents where counterfeit drugs made their way to unsuspecting patients across the US Moved by the gravity of human lives at stake,
    and immersed in IoT research, Dahod had the idea to lift the journey of a pharmaceutical product up into the digital cloud; its footprint would be
    managed digitally, thereby securing the passage of safe medicines from manufacturer to patient and all steps in between.
 
A few years before the US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) became law, Dahod launched TraceLink and introduced the Life Sciences Cloud, a cloud-based
    software hosted by Amazon Web Services that has become the world’s largest track and trace network for the life sciences supply chain. His passion
    for cutting-edge technology and business model innovation was the driving force behind what is now the de-facto industry standard for meeting time-bound
    global regulatory compliance requirements and protecting patients across the globe from the threat of counterfeit medicines.
 
Dahod says, "At TraceLink, we are blending decades of knowledge in technology, life sciences, and supply chain business process with a revolutionary approach
    to digitally transform the life sciences supply chain. My contribution is to leverage 32 years of experience in engineering, product innovation, and
    business strategy, in order to provide our customers with a proven software solution that enables our customers to exchange critical data with their
    network of trade partners while easing the burden of complying with global track and trace regulations. "
 
Early in his career, Dahod worked with Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen at his Seattle-based startup, Asymetrix, where he established the company as a leader
    in Multimedia Authoring technology in the computer based learning market. With Allen, Dahod researched and incubated a number of emerging web-based
    products and technologies, including early initiatives in e-commerce, natural language query, online sports, digital media, and Java development tools.
    He eventually served as a Senior Executive of the Paul Allen group of companies, and later joined Microsoft as a Senior Leader to spearhead collaboration
    and knowledge management efforts using emerging XML standards and new Internet communication tools.
 
Dahod holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in computer science from Boston University.

NORTH READING, Mass., June 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- TraceLink Inc., the World's Largest Track and Trace Network for connecting the life sciences supply chain and providing real-time information sharing for better patient outcomes, today announced end-to-end administration services for U.S. hospitals and pharmacies that use its proven Product Track transaction history management software to meet the compliance requirements of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). 








On July 1st, TraceLink will begin transitioning its 350+ healthcare customers to Product Track with End-to-End Administration, which will be bundled into their existing TraceLink subscription at no extra cost. Additionally, through TraceLink's expansive network of alliances with group purchasing organizations (GPOs), covering more than 90 percent of the entire U.S. hospital market, GPO member hospitals and pharmacies can take advantage of special pricing and pre-negotiated terms for TraceLink Product Track with End-to-End Administration. 
Every customer who subscribes to Product Track will now benefit from a set of end-to-end administration services provided by TraceLink that are designed to eliminate the time-intensive tasks of managing product, partner and company master data, exceptions, paper-to-digital processing, continuous quality control checks, and document preparation for audits. As a result, hospitals and pharmacies are able to increase the time they spend providing care to patients by offloading all of their DSCSA compliance requirements to a dedicated team of TraceLink service and compliance experts.
"In working closely with the hospitals and pharmacies that use our products daily to manage lot-level transaction histories at thousands of dispensing locations, many have expressed an interest in having TraceLink remove additional time consuming tasks that DSCSA has introduced into their pharmacy operations," said Shabbir Dahod, president and CEO of TraceLink. "We've responded by expanding our current solution to eliminate the time that healthcare providers need to spend on maintaining master data, adding new trading partners, and resolving exceptions. Going forward, TraceLink will assume all of these responsibilities – at no incremental cost – so that pharmacists and clinicians can do what they do best: provide consultative care to their patients."
TraceLink Product Track with End-to-End Administration: How It Works
TraceLink Product Track is the transaction history management system used by more U.S. hospitals and pharmacies to achieve DSCSA compliance than any other solution. The software runs on a single platform that connects to prescription drug suppliers and processes all pharmacy-related DSCSA compliance information.
Product Track with End-to-End Administration leverages TraceLink staff who shoulder the full workload associated with compliance-related tasks for hospitals and pharmacies, including:

Adding and maintaining any missing product master data – for drug products that are purchased by a pharmacy. 
Adding, removing, and maintaining any partners – with whom an organization works to purchase drug products. 
Adding or removing company locations – to cover all dispensing locations within the same operation. 
Adding or removing new users, or changing user access permissions – as staffing needs evolve and new users need to use the Product Track software. 
Active maintenance and monitoring of exceptions – that occur as a result of receiving POs or ASNs from suppliers with missing information required by DSCSA. 
Reprocessing any necessary transactions – after researching exceptions and validating that Product Track information is accurate and compliant. 
Utilizing TraceLink's unique and proprietary "network-sourced" NDC database – to continuously update new NDCs that are discovered across the TraceLink Network, an exclusive benefit to TraceLink customers. 
Manually entering required DSCSA data to create digital T3 from user scanned or uploaded paper documents – then appending the originally-scanned PO to ensure a fully-compliant, all-digital database of T3s. 
Actively monitor data quality, and provide full customer support during an inquiry – if a Request for Information is initiated by a regulatory authority, to ensure that the customer can supply the required compliance information within the 48-hour business response time.
