    I've used this app for over a year and find it very helpful for falling asleep and preparing for the day. It has come to be a part of my routine. After listening to the "falling asleep" meditation I change to another app that allows you to mix various sounds as background for a wide variety of activities. I have a mix I made for sleep and I set it to play for two hours. I always fall asleep quickly and sleep soundly. The option this app has to record how you feel physically and emotionally, before and after your meditation, intrigues me and I do record the before feeling but it is not particularly instructive. I would like it if I could record a current condition or event that contributes to the feelings, a note about what is going on that relates to the feeling such as: sick or worried about politics or friends in town or pet hurt or great photos of jack rabbits or read inspiring book or terrific hike, etc.. It could only record a designated number of characters but could be very helpful as a kind of ongoing measure of one's physical and emotional state along with factors that contributed to that state and meditations that help you manage your responses . You could get a running and long term view from which a targeted meditation plan could be created. This app is routinely updated and has consistently improved. I see great potential for future versions.
  



Amazing app

    This is my favorite app on my phone. I love the variety of meditations and even yoga. It helps me stop, think, and breathe - not to be cliche or anything. But it reminds me to slow down and to breathe when I have anxiety. It truly helps my anxiety and reminds me my anxiety is not my identity. I also love the stickers! This app has helped me through so much and constantly reminds me to be mindful. Such a great guided meditation and even helps those whose minds can be constantly running and going to stop and be present. I like that there are a variety of lengths so I can build up to something a little longer or if I am short on time, I can still make time for a small mediation. The voices are soothing and compassionate. I feel like I am being wrapped in a warm blanket. This is just a great app.
  



I just love this app⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

    Everything about this app is amazing, I find it very relaxing grounding and clearing up my mind! Are use it every day at like all times! This is just about may be the best app on my phone! I give this app five stars for being easy to use, and giving a great amount of content without paying a dime! First you "check in" by telling 5 emotions and how you feel physically and emotionally! There is even a kids version, great, so excited to try it with my sisters!!! This app is great, not boring at all, and over all easy to use, I have always recommend this to friends and family, and to everyone else who is a living being! Hope you liked the review! From Oh just me!

    My 7 year old daughter and I have been using Stop, Breathe, and Think for a long time... usually before bed. We were excited to see a version for kids. She loves to "check in" by choosing her emotions. We listened to a meditation tonight, and she was asleep before it ended. So calming, so relaxing. Thank you!!

Under no circumstances shall SBT be liable to any User in connection with that User’s use or misuse of the Content or the Services. Such limitation of liability shall apply to prevent recovery of indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, and punitive damages whether such claim is based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise (even if SBT has been advised of the possibility of such damages). This limitation of liability shall apply whether the damages arise from use or misuse of and reliance on the Content or Services, from inability to use the Content or Services, from any claim relating to the user of the Content or the Services, or from the interruption, suspension, or termination of the Content or Services. Some states or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you.
15. RELEASE
You hereby release us, our officers, employees, investors, agents and successors from claims, demands, any and all losses, damages, rights, claims, and actions of any kind including, without limitation, personal injuries, emotional distress, death and property damage, that is either directly or indirectly related to or arises from (i) any interaction you have with other Users, (ii) your use of the Services or (iii) your participation in any offline events. If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
16. INDEMNITY
You agree to defend, indemnify and hold SBT, their officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Content or Services or your violation of these Terms of Service.
17. RESPONSIBILITY
Your interaction with other Users on the Services or with third parties, including any payment or delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and the other User, advertiser or third party. You agree that SBT will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such dealings or with respect to any third party’s use or disclosure of your personal information that you make available to them. If there is a dispute between you and any third party (including any User), we are under no obligation to become involved and you agree not to involve us unless we request otherwise in writing; however, we reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Users or third parties.
18. THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND PARTNER COMMUNITIES
The Services may contain links to third party applications, websites or services, and also may be accessed via a plug-in through third party applications, websites or services (“Third Party Services”). We may also enable sharing and interoperability to Third Party Services, Partner Communities and other Users or use other means that allow you to connect the SBT Services to Third Party Services, Partner Communities and other Users. You use all such connections to Third Party Services and Partner Communities at your own risk. To the extent such links are provided by us, they are provided only as a convenience and do not imply our endorsement of or affiliation with such Third Party Service or Partner Community. While we will always strive to select the best partners, we accept no responsibility for the quality, content, policies or reliability of Third Party Services or Partner Communities or for links back to the SBT Services. You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, for any Third Party Services or Partner Communities and should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate and choose appropriate settings for sharing your personal information before proceeding with any interaction with a Third Party Service or Partner Community.
19. COMMENTS
If you have comments on the SBT Services or ideas on how we might improve, please contact us at [email protected]. If you submit any comments or ideas to us, you hereby grant to us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully-paid, royalty-free, sub-licensable and transferable license under any and all Intellectual Property Rights that you own or control to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon and otherwise exploit the comments and ideas for any purpose. The licenses granted under this Section shall survive the termination or expiration of these Terms of Service.
20. INITIAL RESOLUTION OF QUESTIONS OR DISPUTES
If you have any questions or concerns about the Services or these Terms of Services, we strongly encourage you to first contact us [email protected] directly.
21. ARBITRATION
For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000 (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief), either party may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any dispute resolution proceedings, whether in arbitration or court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class or representative action or as a named or unnamed member in a class, consolidated, representative or private attorney general legal action.
22. LAW AND JURISDICTION
These Terms of Service shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against SBT must be resolved by a court located in Los Angeles County, California, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as in the arbitration option. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Los Angeles County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
23. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
If for any reason a court finds any provision or portion of this Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect. The provisions of these Terms of Service that by their nature are continuing will survive any termination. This Terms of Service is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the Services and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous communications or agreements, written or oral. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by SBT.

      What parents need to know    



Educational valueKids can learn the practice of meditation, how to take stock of their emotions, and how to self-regulate. They also can let the app suggest "missions" based on the feelings they report, or they can select the right technique on their own. 
 



Ease of playAfter parents watch the intro video, it's easy for kids to take a spin through the app on their own.

Parents Need to Know

Parents need to know that Stop, Breathe, and Think Kids: Focus, Calm & Sleep is a just-for-kids version of the popular app for teens and adults. It's geared toward kids age 5 through 10, and it features 15 short video meditation "missions," each of which last between two and eight minutes. The videos feature audio that guides kids through meditations and and quirky, sweet animations featuring cute animals. Kids can reflect on their emotions and then choose a mission recommended by the app, or they can browse all available missions and pick one on their own. Though all the missions are free at the time of review, additional missions and features may be available in the future via in-app purchases. You can read more about information that the app gathers and shares in its privacy policy.
 

What's it about?STOP, BREATHE & THINK KIDS: FOCUS, CALM & SLEEP is an app that features 15 guided meditation videos called "missions" for kids age 5 to 10. You can access the missions in two ways: Either reflect and report your feelings by selecting emojis, or browse the full list of missions and pick one that feels like the best fit. The missions are grouped into seven categories (Quiet, Focus, Caring & Connecting, Energizing, Meltdown, Open Mind, and Sleep), and some missions appear in more than one category. Kids can earn stickers for the missions they complete, and the app tracks your progress, including which missions you've completed and how often you use the app.
Is it any good?QUALITYThis is a fabulous tool to help kids learn to identify and manage their emotions. Stop, Breathe, and Think Kids: Focus, Calm & Sleep has kid-friendly animations, and a sticker reward system will keep kids coming back for the missions. And they'll learn good habits for taking stock of how they feel and taking action to help them feel more calm, focused, or ready to go to bed. It's also great that the app features an intro video that features tips for parents about how to use the app. While kids can certainly use the app on their own, there's even greater potential for using the app to help parents and kids structure conversations about feelings and how to cope with them. 
Families can talk about...Families can talk about what makes kids mad, sad, silly, or worried. Parents might give kids examples of what makes them upset and talk about the difference between feeling a little bit mad and extremely mad. Talk to kids about how high emotions make it difficult to solve problems or communicate well. How can an app like Stop, Breathe, and Think Kids: Focus, Calm & Sleep help?

Talk about how it feels to meditate. Was it difficult to follow the instructions? Why, or why not? How did it make you feel? Why? When might it be a good time to practice meditation?

As kids begin to name and label their emotions independently, challenge them to take on others' perspectives in the same situation. For example, if a friend falls down on the playground, how do you react? How might the friend react? Are the reactions the same or different?

Work with your kids to transfer the deep-breathing skills outside the app so kids can use them even when they don't have a device handy.

Last updated December 15, 2016
Stop, Breathe & Think respects the privacy of its users.  We believe that the regular practice of mindfulness and compassion is the key to mental wellness. Our intention is to create a safe and secure environment for our users. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) informs you about our policies and practices regarding the collection and use of your information and lets you know about options that you have to control or restrict the availability and use of your information.
1. ABOUT US
We are Stop, Breathe & Think, PBC (“SBT”, “us”, “we” or “our), a public benefit corporation registered under the laws of the state of Delaware in the United States with its principal office address at 11111 Santa Monica Boulevard, Suite 1700, Los Angeles, CA, 90025, USA, (424) 901-5114.  Originally established by Tools for Peace, SBT allocates 10% of net sales to support the mission of providing mental wellness to youth in underserved communities.
2. ABOUT OUR SERVICES
Stop, Breathe & Think provides easy tools and inspiring content to help improve your mental wellness, every day.  We deliver to users (“Users,” “you”, “your”) meditation and mental wellness tools via the SBT mobile applications, the SBT website (currently located at www.stopbreathethink.com), and through other platforms and media through which we may make the services available (the “Services”).
3. ABOUT THIS PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Policy informs you of SBT’s policies and practices regarding the collection and use of information you submit to us or which we collect about you through our Services.  We will only use your information or share your information in the ways we describe in this Privacy Policy.  The Privacy Policy also outlines options that you have to control or restrict the availability and use of your information. Wherever you reside or from whichever country you submit your information, you consent to our use of your information, consistent with this Privacy Policy, in the United States and in other territories where SBT provides its Services.
4. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY
SBT reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will usually inform you of any changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy through the mobile applications and on the SBT website.  If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post a notification through the mobile applications and on the SBT website and, if you are registered, notify you via your preferred means of contact for such notices (e-mail or text message) and/or by asking you to review the changes to the Privacy Policy the next time you access the Services. Your continued use of the Services after the changes are communicated will indicate your consent to our use of your information consistent with this Privacy Policy, including those changes.
5. WHY DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION?
We want to give Users the best experience possible. We collect information to manage  the Services, to deliver to our Users a personalized experience, and to improve our Services, features and content.
6. SOME TERMS WE USE IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.
Important terms that we use in this Privacy Policy are “Personal Information”, Non-Identifying Information” and “Log Data”. To explain what we mean by these terms:
a.       “Personal Information” is information about you that can be used to contact or identify you, such as your full name, street address, e-mail address or mobile number. It also may include financial information and certain health-related information that you may provide.
b.       “Non-Identifying Information” means information that does not permit the identification of an individual person, such as other information that you provide as part of your use of the Services. Some Non-Identifying Information could be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers in a way that enables you to be identified.
c.       “Log Data” is derived by our servers automatically as you interact with the Services, which record information that your browser or mobile device sends whenever you interact with the Service. Log Data is a form of Non-Identifying Information.
7. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
a.       Personal Information.  When you create an account or connect through a connected social networking community (“Partner Communities”), we may collect your first and last name, your age or birth date, your gender and your e-mail address.  If you register for our Services via a Partner Community, we will obtain certain Personal Information you have provided to the Partner Community (such as your name, profile picture, e-mail address, date of birth and specific address or general location).  If you enable interoperability with a third party application, additional Personal Information that you have provided to that third party application may be collected and/or you may specifically authorize SBT to access certain information from such third party application.  The information we obtain may depend on the privacy settings you have with the third party application or Partner Community, and the information obtained may not be visible in your account.  If you choose to view content that may be available through a subscription (“Subscription Services”) or purchase premium content, we will also collect credit card or other payment information and your billing address.
b.       Non-Identifying Information.  We also collect some Non-Identifying Information about you and your feelings as you navigate through our Services.  For example, when you first describe your mental, physical and emotional status as you enter the Services, you are explicitly sending information about yourself, which SBT will use to improve its recommendations to you.  We also track the content and time you are meditating for the purposes of improving your experience and tracking your progress.  In addition, third party applications to which you opt to connect may collect and share with SBT Non-Identifying Information about your health or physical fitness. We will only collect your location through your mobile device if you have granted us that permission.
c.       Log Data.  When you interact with the Services, our servers automatically record Log Data that your mobile device or browser sends. This Log Data may include information such as your mobile device identifier, your computer’s IP (Internet Protocol) address and browser type, your operating system, and other analytics that help us deliver and monitor the effectiveness of our Services.
d.       Information You Share. If you enter any information (including Personal Information) when you share a meditation or feature with another person, we may collect this information, but the information will not be viewable beyond those contacts with whom you chose to share it.
d.       Contacting Us.  When you leave us feedback or write to us directly, we will collect any information that is contained in your feedback or comment form, which will include your e-mail address and other information that you may submit to us for reference or reply.
8. HOW WE PROTECT CHILD USERS
Different practices apply to Users under the age of 13 (“Child Users”), as required by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).  Once a User indicates by entering their birth date that they are a Child User, the only additional Personal Information that will be requested is the Child User’s first name and their e-mail address, which will be encrypted and will only be used if needed to reset a password.  There will be no further opportunity for the Child User to submit Personal Information.  Certain Non-Identifying Information may be collected from a Child User solely to enable SBT to deliver the Services and personalize the Services for the Child User.  If another User (not a Child User) wishes to purchase a subscription or premium content for the Child User as a gift, only information and data for the purchaser shall be stored in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and the purchase shall not result in the storage of additional data about the Child User.  The Child User will not receive push notifications or any communications from the SBT Service, and geo-location and sharing will be disabled.  Any further collection of information from or communications with the Child User beyond what is described in this Privacy Policy will be subject to advance parental consent under COPPA.  If you have any further questions about how information from a Child User is collected or used, please contact us at support@stopbreathethink.com.
9. DOES SBT USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING METHODS?
a.       On the SBT website SBT may use web beacons, session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which remain for a certain period of time unless deleted) which may provide Non-Identifying Information: (i) to deliver content requested by the Users or to recommend content we think may be of interest; (ii) for analytics purposes, to monitor usage of the website, to reengage users, or to improve user experience; and (iii) to remember choices you make in order to improve user experience.
b.       We also may collect information through the mobile application about your individual device.  The purpose of this collection is: (i) to deliver content requested by the Users or to recommend content we think may be of interest; (ii) to optimize the Services for the particular mobile device; and (iii) to gather analytics and data about the way the Services are used through the mobile applications.
c.       Your options. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set. Instructions to remove persistent cookies can be found through your Internet browser, or through associated websites that advise how to engage “Do Not Track”.  Mobile devices may contain settings that allow you to disable tracking and/or analytics. SBT will respect all such instructions it receives.  Be aware, however, that if you choose to disable cookies or opt out of tracking or disengage similar features on your mobile device, some or all areas of the Services may not be optimized for your use and you may not be able to access the functionality of the Services.
10. HOW DO WE USE INFORMATION INTERNALLY?
We use your Personal Information in some cases in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information to recommend and deliver to you content and features we think you will enjoy, based on your expressed preferences and emotional, mental and physical status. Log Data is used to track and report to you on your progress, monitor and analyze use of the Services, to analyze usage patterns, to optimize your access to our Services, and to control the load on our servers so that we can serve you better. We may also combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and Log Data and aggregate it with information collected from other Users to improve the quality and performance of our Services and to analyze how our Services are used. We may use your e-mail address or mobile number or the push notification feature, if you choose to enable it, to remind you about the Services and new options that we may make available and to inform you about changes to our Services.
11. WHEN DO WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH OTHERS, AND WITH WHOM?
a.       Information that you Share. If you choose to share Personal Information that has been collected by SBT, whether through a post or commenting feature, or by making it available to a health practitioner, it will become known to those other individuals or the public.
b.       Payment Processors.  If you sign up through SBT for a Subscription Service or purchase premium content, a third party payment processor may have access to your Personal Information for the sole purpose of processing transactions and renewals.  Any such payment processors will be bound to maintain all such Personal Information in a secure environment, keep its confidentiality and not use or disclose such information for any purpose other than to validate purchases and operate Subscription Services. If you purchased content or signed up for Subscription Services through an app store, you should refer to that store’s terms for information on how it maintains personal financial information.
c.       Other Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to help us deliver our Services, to perform maintenance and research services, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used (such as infrastructure providers, database management, web or mobile analytics and improvement of the Services’ features). These third parties may have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
d.       Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information. We may disclose to third parties information that does not include Personal Information but may include aggregated Non-Identifying Information and Log Data for the purposes of industry analysis, research, demographic profiling, marketing, and other purposes relating to our Services.  Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
e.       Business Transfers. If SBT or the assets of SBT are acquired by another company, we may transfer your information in connection with that acquisition or sale and the acquiring company will possess the information (including your Personal Information) collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations described in this Privacy Policy.
f.        Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement. We may access and disclose your Personal Information to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable laws, to respond to valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, to protect the property and rights of SBT or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable.
12. APPLE HEALTHKIT & OTHER INTEGRATIONS?
SBT offers to its users integrations with Apple HealthKit and other health-related applications (“Health Apps”) through which the Health Apps may receive certain Non-Identifying Information from SBT solely for the purpose of viewing and improving your health data through that Health App.  If you so elect, SBT may receive certain Non-Identifying Information that has been generated by the Health App. Such Health App data may be used by SBT to personalize and provide the SBT Service to you and will only be shared with third parties that are providing health or fitness services to you or are engaged in medical research.  Data received from the Health App will not be used for marketing purposes.
13. HOW CAN I EDIT MY INFORMATION OR UNSUBSCRIBE FROM COMMUNICATIONS?
You may access, update and edit certain Personal Information that is in your account. When you receive messages from us by your chosen method of communication (whether e-mail or text or by push notification), you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us by electing to “unsubscribe” and you may turn off notifications on your mobile device.  We may, however, still send you administrative messages regarding the Services.  You may contact us support@stopbreathethink.com with a request that we delete your Personal Information from our database or remove other information that you no longer wish to include as part of the Services. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to honor your request.  We may retain an archived copy of your records as required by law or for legitimate business purposes.

Unless there is a specific legal or regulatory requirement for us to keep information, we will retain it for no longer than is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.
15. WHERE WILL INFORMATION BE COLLECTED AND STORED?
SBT is located in the United States. Accordingly, Personal Information we collect may be transferred to and stored in our servers or those of third parties that act on our behalf (such as hosting providers) in the United States or other countries outside of the European Economic Area. By using the Services you agree to such collection, transfer and storage outside of the European Economic Area or other territories where the information may have been collected.
16. HOW SECURE IS THE INFORMATION?
You should be aware that while we take industry standard administrative, physical and technological measures to maintain the security of your Personal Information, we are not able to fully eliminate all security risks or potential breaches.
17. WHAT POLICIES APPLY TO THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS?
The Services may contain links or integrations to third party applications, websites or services, and also may be accessed via a plug-in through third party applications, websites or services. We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for these outside services or their content. This Privacy Policy does not govern your visits to these other services, and your access is entirely at your own risk. These other services and applications may set their own cookies on users, collect data, or solicit personal information. You should refer to any privacy policies on such services and applications to understand how your information may be collected and used, and should choose appropriate settings for sharing your personal information before proceeding to any integration with a third party service or application.

Other features may allow for purchases of premium Content.  Your payment may be charged directly by SBT through its payment processor, or through your mobile application provider, in which case you should look to the provider’s terms regarding in –app payments.
a.       Your subscriber account. If you purchase Subscription Services, you agree that your subscription is personal to you and the members of your household, and you may not share your account and password with others.

For an annual subscription, you will be notified in advance of that renewal. For all subscription plans, if you do not wish your subscription to renew, you may cancel at any time through your account. SBT will not refund any unused or inadvertently renewed subscriptions, and it is always within SBT’s sole discretion whether to grant any refunds. Child Users may not sign up for Subscription Services.  If the parent or guardian of a Child User wishes to purchase a Subscription Service for the Child User, the parent or guardian must create an account and gift the subscription to the Child User.  In that event, all account information will relate to the parent or guardian and no personal information will be retained for the Child User.

12.   LEGAL OBLIGATIONS
In order to cooperate with legitimate government or regulator requests, subpoenas or court orders, to protect our systems and Users, to protect the property and rights of SBT or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable, we may access and disclose any information and Content we consider necessary or appropriate, including, without limitation, account information, device ID, IP address, usage history and other information and data.

20.   INITIAL RESOLUTION OF QUESTIONS OR DISPUTES
If you have any questions or concerns about the Services or these Terms of Services, we strongly encourage you to first contact us support@stopbreathethink.com directly.

For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000 (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief), either party may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution (“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (i) the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (ii) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (iii) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

22.   LAW AND JURISDICTION
These Terms of Service shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction. You agree that any claim or dispute you may have against SBT must be resolved by a court located in Los Angeles County, California, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as in the arbitration option. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Los Angeles County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
23.   MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
If for any reason a court finds any provision or portion of this Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the remainder of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect. The provisions of these Terms of Service that by their nature are continuing will survive any termination. This Terms of Service is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the use of the Services and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous communications or agreements, written or oral. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by SBT.

LEARN THE BASICS



GET MEDITATING IN 5 MINUTES. EASY.
With this app, you can practice Mindfulness and Meditation through a process called STOP, BREATHE & THINK:

STOP: what you are doing. Check in with what you are thinking, and how you are feeling.
BREATHE: practice mindful breathing to create space between your thoughts, emotions and reactions.
THINK: learn to settle down and strengthen your force field of peace and calm by practicing one of the meditations.




WHAT IS MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION?
Mindfulness is a way of paying attention to what is happening right now, by observing what’s going on inside (your thoughts, feelings and physical sensations) and outside (your interactions and surroundings) with an open mind and without judgment.
Mindfulness helps us stay focused and present when we practice the two kinds of meditation offered in SB&T: Active Thinking, where we intentionally direct our thoughts and imagination to think and feel positively, and Resting the Mind, where we let it all go.

WHAT MINDFULNESS CAN DO FOR YOU:

Have you ever been in a bad mood and didn’t know why? You can practice mindfulness to investigate/figure out what’s going on in your head, and to see how it’s impacting your feelings and actions.
You can identify and work with nagging, repetitive thoughts that add to stress.
You can change annoying habits.
You can create space between your thoughts and reactions so you don’t keep doing unproductive things.
You can create a sense of peace and well-being by strengthening your kindness and compassion.


WHAT TO EXPECT:

All sorts of things come up when you practice mindfulness: thoughts, feelings, sounds, and physical sensations
Sometimes it can feel uncomfortable, other times it goes really smoothly and feels great.
Don’t worry - it’s all part of the experience. The point is to notice & observe what’s going on with an open mind, and to learn not to get hung up on anything in particular. If you get stuck, just bring your attention to something neutral, like your breathing.




HOW DO MINDFULNESS & MEDITATION WORK?

THOUGHTS AND THE BRAIN
You can re-wire your brain just by meditating because our brains change based on how they are used. Every time you have a thought, neurons connect like little impulses across the map of your brain. When these neurons connect, your brain grows thicker and stronger in certain places based on the thoughts you think. We can actually change the circuitry of the brain to help us be more peaceful and compassionate, simply by directing our thoughts and imaginations. Just like a bodybuilder lifting weights to build muscle, the more you think positive thoughts, the stronger the part of your brain that allows you to experience positive feelings will become!




STRESS AND THE BODY
Many of the body’s functions work automatically, like breathing, blood pressure and digestion. These functions are controlled by the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). The ANS is divided into two branches: the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS) - the "fight or flight" response during stress, intense activity, and emergencies, and the Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS) - the "rest & digest", or calming response.


The SNS or "fight or flight" is responsible for what happens to your body in response to very stressful situations. Adrenaline circulates through the blood, affecting every organ. Your heart pumps faster, blood pressure rises, breathing becomes faster and more shallow, pupils expand, and your muscles tighten. The SNS is your body’s natural response during emergencies, but often times it is triggered during everyday stress, and when this happens it can make us feel unhealthy.





When we practice mindfulness and meditation and focus on deep relaxed breaths, we can turn off the SNS and turn on our Parasympathetic Nervous System (PNS), also known as "rest and digest", which calms us down and helps us to relax. When the PNS is activated, your heart rate drops, blood pressure falls, breathing slows and deepens, pupils shrink, and muscles relax. This promotes good digestion, supports your immune system and just makes you feel good all over.






PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE.

CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT
Mindfulness and Meditation can be done anytime, anywhere, and people don’t even have to know you are doing it.

PRACTICE MINDFULNESS ANYTIME!

Walking
Taking the bus
Riding a bike
Playing sports
Opening a book
Answering the phone
Getting out of your chair


You can do any of these things mindfully by just noticing your breathing, what your body feels like, what you are thinking and what you are feeling.
If you have the opportunity, you can create a quiet space without distractions, where you can sit comfortably and in a relaxed position, on a cushion or chair. If you are sitting on a chair, place your feet flat on the floor.
When you begin your mindfulness practice, remember to check your posture. Is your back straight? Can you breathe easy?
If you feel tired or lethargic, it helps to sit up straight!

PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT!

You’re not going to be Master of Mindfulness right away. The more you do it, the better you get. Just like lifting weights to make your body stronger, you’re using mindfulness to help strengthen your brain.



Sometimes it helps to set a regular time and place to practice. Sometimes, you might have a hard time actually feeling some of the positive feelings talked about in each of the meditations. That’s ok! Just doing the meditations and giving yourself the opportunity to feel these positive feelings is a huge step.



ABOUT EACH MEDITATION
These meditations are intended to encourage and inspire thinking and acting in positive ways. They give you a chance to broaden your perspective, which can help you settle yourself down when you are upset or stressed. It may not happen right away, but be confident that with practice, it will!

WELCOMING THE DAY
Meditation can be especially fruitful when transitioning from being asleep to being awake. Begin the day mindfully with this gentle meditation for awakening by focusing on your body’s natural feelings of warmth  and peace. Plant the seed of peacefulness when your mind is dawning, just like the new day.



FALLING ASLEEP
Meditation can be especially fruitful when transitioning from being awake to falling asleep. Let go of the day’s stresses and prepare for sleep with this guided meditation. Allow yourself to relax into open awareness, and enjoy your body’s natural warmth and peace as you drift into sleep.
MINDFUL BREATHING
Learn to observe what’s going on inside (your thoughts, feelings and physical sensations) and outside (your interactions and surroundings) with an open mind and without judging, by intentionally bringing your awareness to the sensation of your breathing.
BODY SCAN
Bring awareness to each part of your body, noticing your experience with a sense of curiosity and without judging. We often carry stress and emotions in the body. Becoming aware of sensations in the body can help us recognize emotions and impulses as they arise. We can change habits of reactivity by choosing to settle ourselves down, and respond differently.
ENGAGING YOUR SENSES
Observe what you experience through your senses without labels like good or bad, or pleasant or unpleasant. Learn to notice and experience things as they are, without reacting to or judging them.


MINDFUL WALK
By bringing mindfulness to everyday activities like walking, you can be more attentive to what’s going on inside (your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations) and outside (your interactions and surroundings) without getting caught up in judging or evaluating. Life is a journey. Enjoy a little peace of mind on your path toward your destination.



BE PRESENT
Listening to the Being Present meditation is about taking a timeout. By focusing on one thing - the sound of running water - you can de-stress and settle yourself down.
GRATITUDE
Appreciate the positive aspects of your life by focusing on the love, kindness and support you have experienced. Through this practice, you’ll gain an increased sense of gratitude, even when aspects of your life need improvement.
CHANGE
Everything is in a constant state of change, all the time. This means that you can work with whatever is going on in your life to grow and improve. When you think about change, you can:

Learn to be more open, relaxed, tolerant, and flexible... so you are able to go with the flow of life!
Experience more happiness and contentment by coping with strong feelings, like sadness and loss.
Feel more balanced and grounded, whether things are going great, or not so well.

COMMONALITY OF SUFFERING
Because we all suffer in some way, recognizing the Commonality of Suffering can help you to be:

Patient and understanding.
Empathetic.
Compassionate - recognizing that we are all in the same boat allows you to develop compassion for yourself, and for other people, whether you know them or not.
Appreciative of what you have.



CAUSE & EFFECT
Every action has a result. When you engage in positive actions, you increase your chances of having positive experiences, and vice versa. The thing to remember is that whatever you do, it is entirely up to you - you’re in the driver’s seat of your choices and future.



KINDNESS
Kindness is the wish that others experience happiness. Focusing on kindness helps you to maintain a broader perspective and look at situations beyond your own point of view.

A broader perspective can help you be less affected by the turbulence of life and remain calm and settled.
If you are having a hard time wishing for the happiness of someone you dislike, try practicing the Commonality of Suffering and Cause and Effect meditations.

EQUANIMITY
Equanimity is a mental calmness and evenness, even when faced with difficulty. Equanimity allows you to keep an open mind and extend your kindness, compassion, and joy to everyone - even the people you might dislike.

Equanimity can help you find common ground.
Equanimity also helps you to see the opportunity for positive change in all situations - the good, the bad, and the ugly.
Try the Equanimity meditation to overcome the habit of always judging people or situations

COMPASSION
Compassion is the recognition that others are suffering, paired with the sincere wish that they be free from it.

Shifting your focus from yourself is another way to strengthen your kindness, and your forcefield of peace and calmness
If you are having a hard time feeling Compassion, try doing the Commonality of Suffering meditation. Just do your best to put yourself in another person’s shoes and try to feel what they are feeling.

JOY
Joy means rejoicing! Celebrate the positive moments, accomplishments, happiness, skills and good qualities you experience, as well as those of other people.

If you are having a hard time feeling Joy, especially for other people, try doing the Gratitude meditation.



GREAT COMPASSION
Break down the barriers that might interfere with your kindness and compassion. After practicing this meditation, you may notice that you have fewer negative thoughts and that you’ll begin to feel capable of having a positive impact on other people.



RELAX, GROUND & CLEAR
With this guided meditation, use your imagination to relax, feel more stable and grounded, and clear your mind.
JUST LIKE ME
Strengthen your equanimity and compassion by focusing on the idea that everyone wants to be happy and avoid suffering. Then, starting with yourself and extending out to all people, visualize breathing in suffering and pain, and sending out love and happiness.
HEALING SADNESS
Through mindfulness and visualization, approach your sadness with gentleness and an open heart, allowing the intensity of the feeling to dissolve and creating a sense of peace and well-being in its place.
DEALING WITH ANXIETY
Learn to recognize the insubstantiality of anxiety and overcome the uneasy sensation through mindful awareness and visualization.
COMPASSION TOWARD CRUELTY
It’s easy to become stuck in negative emotions for someone who we feel is causing us pain. Meditating in a compassionate way will soothe your difficult feelings and help you become more relaxed when relating to others. When you are calm, you will be able to deal with real problems without being sidetracked by negative emotions.
SOUND BED
Experience meditation and mindfulness in your own way with this soothing, ambient musical track, giving you the space to decompress and be in the present moment.
