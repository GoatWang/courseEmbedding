If so, the Walmart Beauty Box is the perfect way to try out new products every season without splashing out on full-size products. It's so easy to spend a lot on a hair, skin or body care item you'll never use again, or to experiment with a new makeup formula that doesn't end up working for you. These full-size products end up taking up a lot of space in your bathroom and gather dust rather than doing their jobs. The Walmart Beauty Box lets you stay plugged in to what's available in our Makeup and Personal Care departments at a low subscription fee. Boxes focus on seasonal essentials, so you can get ready for new looks and changing beauty maintenance needs throughout the year.Shopping for makeup onlineBrowsing through the products on our site offers a quick and easy way for you to find new favorites. However, if you aren't sure exactly what color you need to match your skin tone, you may want to pick out a few different options that look like they may work for your skin tone. If free store pickup is an option for your chosen products, you can take a look at the shades in person when you pick them up from the store and complete your return on the options that don't work for your skin tone without having to bring them home.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147384875, DC-prod-dfw2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

These tips can help. Whether you are looking for a quick fix to tighten your skin and reduce the signs of aging or simply for some everyday skincare essential, the selection available at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart makes it easy to find the right kind of product for your skin type. Day and night moisturizers Moisturizer is an essential step in your daily skin-care routine, so you should look for a formula that best suits your skin type. Determine whether your skin is oily, dry, or sensitive as this impacts the way a moisturizer interacts with your skin. Moreover, keep in mind that repetition is essential when it comes to skin care products, so it is important to establish a daily routine. Do your research before buying a moisturizer by reading the labels to find out the active ingredients and what they claim to do for your skin.  If you have sensitive skin, you should always go for products that are hypoallergenic and free from fragrances and dyes. A day moisturizer with a 15-30 SPF range is a good choice for those with fair skin that gets sunburned easily. Consider your age when choosing a night moisturizing cream. A cream with natural ingredients such as honey and aloe vera works well in your 20s, while an anti-wrinkle cream is a good choice in your 40s. cleansers and toners Your skin type is also essential when shopping for cleansers and toners. These products allow you to clean and tone your skin, while also removing your makeup. Our range of cleansers and toners suits various skin types and is often efficient even on waterproof makeup.  The main skin types cleansers and toners are suitable for include oily, dry and sensitive. By using a cleanser followed by a toner, you will enjoy skin that is free from impurities and dead cells while being soft and smooth. Cleansers come in multiple forms, with common types being foam and lotions. The choice is up to what you prefer. Acne and rosacea treatments If you have a long-term skin problem such as acne or rosacea, you need specific products that can address this issue. We stock a wide range of treatment creams and cleansers for these and other skin troubles. Rosacea usually develops on the central portion of the face and requires a gentle, but persistent routine. Wash your face every morning with a gentle cleanser and lukewarm water, and apply an anti-redness treatment cream, followed by sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher. At night, cleanse and moisturize again. Acne skin requires targeted treatment, and it is essential to steer clear of any skin care product that contains menthol, alcohol or fragrance. Opt for skin care that is specifically designed for acne, such as products containing silicone that lock moisture into the skin, and products with natural ingredients that calm the skin. Sun care Prolonged exposure to the sun can be brutal on your skin, so make sure the entire family gets the correct level of protection against the harmful rays. Applying sunscreen and SPF protective lip balm should be a part of your daily routine as the mercury rises. Broad-spectrum sunscreen products protect your skin from both UVA and UVB rays. Remember to apply sunscreen every time you get out of the house in the hot months. Reapply as needed after swimming or exercising. In winter, sunscreen may be needed when skiing or other times you're out in the sun and reflective snow for longer periods of time. Children need extra protection against the rays of sun, so opt for sun care products with a higher SPF that are designed specifically for little ones. Face masks Deep cleansing is essential for your skin regularly, and a face mask is the easiest way to do so at home. Consider your skin s requirements before buying a face mask, paying specific attention to the listed ingredients if you have skin problems. Clay face masks are ideal for giving your skin a deep cleanse. They work well on acne prone skin or on oily complexions because they draw out impurities while soaking up the grease. If you have dry skin, opt for a hydrating mask that comes packed with moisture-active ingredients and soothing agents. Anti-aging masks work well on mature skin, and they often offer a mix of hydration and cell renewal therapy.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147366606, DC-prod-dfw1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

History[edit]
The Almay Brand was originally established in 1931 and was named after the founders, Alfred and Fanny May Woititz. The creation of this cosmetic brand began when Fanny May Woititz was in need of cosmetic products that did not irritate her sensitive skin. Her husband Alfred, who was a professional chemist, started experimenting with makeup to find ingredients that were purer and gentler. With the help of dermatologist Marion Sulzberger, they developed the first cosmetic brand that used hypoallergenic ingredients.[3]
Almay was the first brand to introduce skincare safety by producing fragrance-free products, by showing all the ingredients used on its product labels, and by testing for allergy, as well as irritation.[citation needed] It was also the first to create a cosmetic line for consumers with specific skin types and those who wear contact lenses.[citation needed] In 1987, Almay was acquired by Revlon and today it has expanded to a full line of skincare and makeup products.
Almay has products for skin, face, lips and eyes. The natural ingredients used include meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) for oily skin, grape seed (Vitis vinifera) for normal skin, and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) for dry skin. Other ingredients in the products include moringa (Moringa oleifera), aloe (Aloe barbadensis), milk thistle (Silybum marianum), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), soybean (Glycine max), and rosehips (Rosa canina).
Elaine Irwin Mellencamp became the spokesperson for Almay in 2004.[4] In 2010, Kate Hudson became a spokesmodel after, and most recently Carrie Underwood.
Cruelty-free cosmetic[edit]
Almay has not conducted animal testing for over 20 years. The company has eliminated testing in all phases of research, development and manufacturing of all their products. They do not support, nor request that suppliers do animal testing. However, they do obey "local laws" in which countries may require animal testing in order to sell products to customers.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2015, the nonprofit organization, Truth in Advertising, filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General alleging that Almay’s “Simply American” marketing campaign was misleading to consumers. The FTC and New York Attorney General claimed that the TV and Internet adverts, which depict the former “American Idol” Carrie Underwood star decked out in red, white and blue along with other patriotic imagery, implied that Almay products were made in the United States, when they contain “non-US components”, misleading consumers.
It was revealed that three of the seven makeup products in the Almay’s “Simply American” commercials were made entirely overseas, in China, Germany and the Czech Republic. Revlon chairman, Ron Perelman, responded that the adverts neither claimed nor implied that Almay cosmetics are made in America. Perelman said their products celebrate the “simple, luminous and fresh-faced” look of American beauty, much as rival L’Oréal depicts the “French look.” Perelman also highlighted that the company employs 1,900 workers at its North Carolina manufacturing plant as evidence of its commitment to American jobs.[5][6]

Almay was the first brand to introduce skincare safety by producing fragrance-free products, by showing all the ingredients used on its product labels, and by testing for allergy, as well as irritation.[citation needed] It was also the first to create a cosmetic line for consumers with specific skin types and those who wear contact lenses.[citation needed] In 1987, Almay was acquired by Revlon and today it has expanded to a full line of skincare and makeup products.
Almay has products for skin, face, lips and eyes. The natural ingredients used include meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) for oily skin, grape seed (Vitis vinifera) for normal skin, and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) for dry skin. Other ingredients in the products include moringa (Moringa oleifera), aloe (Aloe barbadensis), milk thistle (Silybum marianum), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), soybean (Glycine max), and rosehips (Rosa canina).
Elaine Irwin Mellencamp became the spokesperson for Almay in 2004.[4] In 2010, Kate Hudson became a spokesmodel after, and most recently Carrie Underwood.
Cruelty-free cosmetic[edit]
Almay has not conducted animal testing for over 20 years. The company has eliminated testing in all phases of research, development and manufacturing of all their products. They do not support, nor request that suppliers do animal testing. However, they do obey "local laws" in which countries may require animal testing in order to sell products to customers.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2015, the nonprofit organization, Truth in Advertising, filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General alleging that Almay’s “Simply American” marketing campaign was misleading to consumers. The FTC and New York Attorney General claimed that the TV and Internet adverts, which depict the former “American Idol” Carrie Underwood star decked out in red, white and blue along with other patriotic imagery, implied that Almay products were made in the United States, when they contain “non-US components”, misleading consumers.
It was revealed that three of the seven makeup products in the Almay’s “Simply American” commercials were made entirely overseas, in China, Germany and the Czech Republic. Revlon chairman, Ron Perelman, responded that the adverts neither claimed nor implied that Almay cosmetics are made in America. Perelman said their products celebrate the “simple, luminous and fresh-faced” look of American beauty, much as rival L’Oréal depicts the “French look.” Perelman also highlighted that the company employs 1,900 workers at its North Carolina manufacturing plant as evidence of its commitment to American jobs.[5][6]

Almay has products for skin, face, lips and eyes. The natural ingredients used include meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) for oily skin, grape seed (Vitis vinifera) for normal skin, and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) for dry skin. Other ingredients in the products include moringa (Moringa oleifera), aloe (Aloe barbadensis), milk thistle (Silybum marianum), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), soybean (Glycine max), and rosehips (Rosa canina).
Elaine Irwin Mellencamp became the spokesperson for Almay in 2004.[4] In 2010, Kate Hudson became a spokesmodel after, and most recently Carrie Underwood.

They do not support, nor request that suppliers do animal testing. However, they do obey "local laws" in which countries may require animal testing in order to sell products to customers.

If you want a basic makeup look, concealer, tinted moisturizer and powder are likely all you need, but you can find full-coverage foundation and highlighters in this section as well if you prefer a more made-up finished look.EyesIf you're looking for mascara, eyeliner, eyeshadow and primers, you'll find them in this section of our Makeup department. You can choose from a variety of different waterproof or plumping formulas for your lashes and finish things off with eyeliner and eyeshadow in a rainbow of colors.LipsLipsticks, glosses, moisturizers and stains are classic staples of any makeup kit. We offer a full range of lip care and makeup products in this product category, offering something for everyone. Whether you prefer a natural makeup look or you like to get glam with classic colors or trendy hues, you can use the filters at the left side of the page to narrow down your color options and zero in on exactly the right kind of lip products for the look you love.BrowsMany makeup looks favor a strong, defined brow, and if you want to get this look, our Brows section has everything you need.

If so, the Walmart Beauty Box is the perfect way to try out new products every season without splashing out on full-size products. It's so easy to spend a lot on a hair, skin or body care item you'll never use again, or to experiment with a new makeup formula that doesn't end up working for you. These full-size products end up taking up a lot of space in your bathroom and gather dust rather than doing their jobs. The Walmart Beauty Box lets you stay plugged in to what's available in our Makeup and Personal Care departments at a low subscription fee. Boxes focus on seasonal essentials, so you can get ready for new looks and changing beauty maintenance needs throughout the year.Shopping for makeup onlineBrowsing through the products on our site offers a quick and easy way for you to find new favorites. However, if you aren't sure exactly what color you need to match your skin tone, you may want to pick out a few different options that look like they may work for your skin tone. If free store pickup is an option for your chosen products, you can take a look at the shades in person when you pick them up from the store and complete your return on the options that don't work for your skin tone without having to bring them home.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349575, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

These tips can help. Whether you are looking for a quick fix to tighten your skin and reduce the signs of aging or simply for some everyday skincare essential, the selection available at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart makes it easy to find the right kind of product for your skin type. Day and night moisturizers Moisturizer is an essential step in your daily skin-care routine, so you should look for a formula that best suits your skin type. Determine whether your skin is oily, dry, or sensitive as this impacts the way a moisturizer interacts with your skin. Moreover, keep in mind that repetition is essential when it comes to skin care products, so it is important to establish a daily routine. Do your research before buying a moisturizer by reading the labels to find out the active ingredients and what they claim to do for your skin.  If you have sensitive skin, you should always go for products that are hypoallergenic and free from fragrances and dyes. A day moisturizer with a 15-30 SPF range is a good choice for those with fair skin that gets sunburned easily. Consider your age when choosing a night moisturizing cream. A cream with natural ingredients such as honey and aloe vera works well in your 20s, while an anti-wrinkle cream is a good choice in your 40s. cleansers and toners Your skin type is also essential when shopping for cleansers and toners. These products allow you to clean and tone your skin, while also removing your makeup. Our range of cleansers and toners suits various skin types and is often efficient even on waterproof makeup.  The main skin types cleansers and toners are suitable for include oily, dry and sensitive. By using a cleanser followed by a toner, you will enjoy skin that is free from impurities and dead cells while being soft and smooth. Cleansers come in multiple forms, with common types being foam and lotions. The choice is up to what you prefer. Acne and rosacea treatments If you have a long-term skin problem such as acne or rosacea, you need specific products that can address this issue. We stock a wide range of treatment creams and cleansers for these and other skin troubles. Rosacea usually develops on the central portion of the face and requires a gentle, but persistent routine. Wash your face every morning with a gentle cleanser and lukewarm water, and apply an anti-redness treatment cream, followed by sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher. At night, cleanse and moisturize again. Acne skin requires targeted treatment, and it is essential to steer clear of any skin care product that contains menthol, alcohol or fragrance. Opt for skin care that is specifically designed for acne, such as products containing silicone that lock moisture into the skin, and products with natural ingredients that calm the skin. Sun care Prolonged exposure to the sun can be brutal on your skin, so make sure the entire family gets the correct level of protection against the harmful rays. Applying sunscreen and SPF protective lip balm should be a part of your daily routine as the mercury rises. Broad-spectrum sunscreen products protect your skin from both UVA and UVB rays. Remember to apply sunscreen every time you get out of the house in the hot months. Reapply as needed after swimming or exercising. In winter, sunscreen may be needed when skiing or other times you're out in the sun and reflective snow for longer periods of time. Children need extra protection against the rays of sun, so opt for sun care products with a higher SPF that are designed specifically for little ones. Face masks Deep cleansing is essential for your skin regularly, and a face mask is the easiest way to do so at home. Consider your skin s requirements before buying a face mask, paying specific attention to the listed ingredients if you have skin problems. Clay face masks are ideal for giving your skin a deep cleanse. They work well on acne prone skin or on oily complexions because they draw out impurities while soaking up the grease. If you have dry skin, opt for a hydrating mask that comes packed with moisture-active ingredients and soothing agents. Anti-aging masks work well on mature skin, and they often offer a mix of hydration and cell renewal therapy.Show moreElectrode, Comp-167313239, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-

History[edit]
The Almay Brand was originally established in 1931 and was named after the founders, Alfred and Fanny May Woititz. The creation of this cosmetic brand began when Fanny May Woititz was in need of cosmetic products that did not irritate her sensitive skin. Her husband Alfred, who was a professional chemist, started experimenting with makeup to find ingredients that were purer and gentler. With the help of dermatologist Marion Sulzberger, they developed the first cosmetic brand that used hypoallergenic ingredients.[3]
Almay was the first brand to introduce skincare safety by producing fragrance-free products, by showing all the ingredients used on its product labels, and by testing for allergy, as well as irritation.[citation needed] It was also the first to create a cosmetic line for consumers with specific skin types and those who wear contact lenses.[citation needed] In 1987, Almay was acquired by Revlon and today it has expanded to a full line of skincare and makeup products.
Almay has products for skin, face, lips and eyes. The natural ingredients used include meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) for oily skin, grape seed (Vitis vinifera) for normal skin, and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) for dry skin. Other ingredients in the products include moringa (Moringa oleifera), aloe (Aloe barbadensis), milk thistle (Silybum marianum), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), soybean (Glycine max), and rosehips (Rosa canina).
Elaine Irwin Mellencamp became the spokesperson for Almay in 2004.[4] In 2010, Kate Hudson became a spokesmodel after, and most recently Carrie Underwood.
Cruelty-free cosmetic[edit]
Almay has not conducted animal testing for over 20 years. The company has eliminated testing in all phases of research, development and manufacturing of all their products. They do not support, nor request that suppliers do animal testing. However, they do obey "local laws" in which countries may require animal testing in order to sell products to customers.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2015, the nonprofit organization, Truth in Advertising, filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General alleging that Almay’s “Simply American” marketing campaign was misleading to consumers. The FTC and New York Attorney General claimed that the TV and Internet adverts, which depict the former “American Idol” Carrie Underwood star decked out in red, white and blue along with other patriotic imagery, implied that Almay products were made in the United States, when they contain “non-US components”, misleading consumers.
It was revealed that three of the seven makeup products in the Almay’s “Simply American” commercials were made entirely overseas, in China, Germany and the Czech Republic. Revlon chairman, Ron Perelman, responded that the adverts neither claimed nor implied that Almay cosmetics are made in America. Perelman said their products celebrate the “simple, luminous and fresh-faced” look of American beauty, much as rival L’Oréal depicts the “French look.” Perelman also highlighted that the company employs 1,900 workers at its North Carolina manufacturing plant as evidence of its commitment to American jobs.[5][6]

History[edit]
The Almay Brand was originally established in 1931 and was named after the founders, Alfred and Fanny May Woititz. The creation of this cosmetic brand began when Fanny May Woititz was in need of cosmetic products that did not irritate her sensitive skin. Her husband Alfred, who was a professional chemist, started experimenting with makeup to find ingredients that were purer and gentler. With the help of dermatologist Marion Sulzberger, they developed the first cosmetic brand that used hypoallergenic ingredients.[3]
Almay was the first brand to introduce skincare safety by producing fragrance-free products, by showing all the ingredients used on its product labels, and by testing for allergy, as well as irritation.[citation needed] It was also the first to create a cosmetic line for consumers with specific skin types and those who wear contact lenses.[citation needed] In 1987, Almay was acquired by Revlon and today it has expanded to a full line of skincare and makeup products.
Almay has products for skin, face, lips and eyes. The natural ingredients used include meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) for oily skin, grape seed (Vitis vinifera) for normal skin, and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) for dry skin. Other ingredients in the products include moringa (Moringa oleifera), aloe (Aloe barbadensis), milk thistle (Silybum marianum), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), soybean (Glycine max), and rosehips (Rosa canina).
Elaine Irwin Mellencamp became the spokesperson for Almay in 2004.[4] In 2010, Kate Hudson became a spokesmodel after, and most recently Carrie Underwood.
Cruelty-free cosmetic[edit]
Almay has not conducted animal testing for over 20 years. The company has eliminated testing in all phases of research, development and manufacturing of all their products. They do not support, nor request that suppliers do animal testing. However, they do obey "local laws" in which countries may require animal testing in order to sell products to customers.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2015, the nonprofit organization, Truth in Advertising, filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General alleging that Almay’s “Simply American” marketing campaign was misleading to consumers. The FTC and New York Attorney General claimed that the TV and Internet adverts, which depict the former “American Idol” Carrie Underwood star decked out in red, white and blue along with other patriotic imagery, implied that Almay products were made in the United States, when they contain “non-US components”, misleading consumers.
It was revealed that three of the seven makeup products in the Almay’s “Simply American” commercials were made entirely overseas, in China, Germany and the Czech Republic. Revlon chairman, Ron Perelman, responded that the adverts neither claimed nor implied that Almay cosmetics are made in America. Perelman said their products celebrate the “simple, luminous and fresh-faced” look of American beauty, much as rival L’Oréal depicts the “French look.” Perelman also highlighted that the company employs 1,900 workers at its North Carolina manufacturing plant as evidence of its commitment to American jobs.[5][6]
Spokesmodels[edit]
Some of the actresses and models that have appeared in Almay advertising include:

Leslie Bibb
Gillian Boudreau
Lisa Butler
Emily Caillon
Karen Duffy
Jennifer Finnigan
Kathie Lee Gifford
Eva Herzigova
Kate Hudson
Lauren Hutton

History[edit]
The Almay Brand was originally established in 1931 and was named after the founders, Alfred and Fanny May Woititz. The creation of this cosmetic brand began when Fanny May Woititz was in need of cosmetic products that did not irritate her sensitive skin. Her husband Alfred, who was a professional chemist, started experimenting with makeup to find ingredients that were purer and gentler. With the help of dermatologist Marion Sulzberger, they developed the first cosmetic brand that used hypoallergenic ingredients.[3]
Almay was the first brand to introduce skincare safety by producing fragrance-free products, by showing all the ingredients used on its product labels, and by testing for allergy, as well as irritation.[citation needed] It was also the first to create a cosmetic line for consumers with specific skin types and those who wear contact lenses.[citation needed] In 1987, Almay was acquired by Revlon and today it has expanded to a full line of skincare and makeup products.
Almay has products for skin, face, lips and eyes. The natural ingredients used include meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria) for oily skin, grape seed (Vitis vinifera) for normal skin, and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) for dry skin. Other ingredients in the products include moringa (Moringa oleifera), aloe (Aloe barbadensis), milk thistle (Silybum marianum), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), soybean (Glycine max), and rosehips (Rosa canina).
Elaine Irwin Mellencamp became the spokesperson for Almay in 2004.[4] In 2010, Kate Hudson became a spokesmodel after, and most recently Carrie Underwood.
Cruelty-free cosmetic[edit]
Almay has not conducted animal testing for over 20 years. The company has eliminated testing in all phases of research, development and manufacturing of all their products. They do not support, nor request that suppliers do animal testing. However, they do obey "local laws" in which countries may require animal testing in order to sell products to customers.
Controversy[edit]
In May 2015, the nonprofit organization, Truth in Advertising, filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General alleging that Almay’s “Simply American” marketing campaign was misleading to consumers. The FTC and New York Attorney General claimed that the TV and Internet adverts, which depict the former “American Idol” Carrie Underwood star decked out in red, white and blue along with other patriotic imagery, implied that Almay products were made in the United States, when they contain “non-US components”, misleading consumers.
It was revealed that three of the seven makeup products in the Almay’s “Simply American” commercials were made entirely overseas, in China, Germany and the Czech Republic. Revlon chairman, Ron Perelman, responded that the adverts neither claimed nor implied that Almay cosmetics are made in America. Perelman said their products celebrate the “simple, luminous and fresh-faced” look of American beauty, much as rival L’Oréal depicts the “French look.” Perelman also highlighted that the company employs 1,900 workers at its North Carolina manufacturing plant as evidence of its commitment to American jobs.[5][6]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
