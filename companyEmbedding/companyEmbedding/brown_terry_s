Terry S. Brown

Mr. Brown, 50, is the chief executive of Edens, an independent owner and operator of shopping centers on the East Coast, including the South Bay Center in Boston and the Port Plaza in Port Jefferson, N.Y.The company, which is based in Columbia, S.C., and founded in 1966, announced last month that it had changed its name from Edens & Avant.Interview conducted and condensed byVIVIAN MARINOQ. Why the name change?A. Edens is a shorter, crisper, tighter name. It’s more recognizable, and it makes sense relative to social media. Edens is reflective of the company that we’ve evolved to and really hope to be in the future.Q. So what are your future goals, at least in 2012?A. We’ve been a very active acquirer over the years — about 60 percent of our portfolio has been acquired. We made two key acquisitions last year: Park Road Shopping Center in Charlotte, N.C., and a shopping center in Fort Lauderdale.

But in 2012 we actually will deliver a little over two million square feet of new retail space through either ground-up development or redevelopment. Continue reading the main story

Q. Where will that space be?A. In Washington, D.C.; Boston; Charlottesville, Va.; and Miami.Q. How much of your portfolio is currently in the New York area?A. A little less than 10 percent. We only own six shopping centers in metro New York out of our 130 shopping centers, but New York is a real strategic growth area for us. We opened an office here in New York last year and really hope over the next three or four years to invest as much as $1 billion in shopping centers in metro New York.Q. Are most of your properties strip malls?A. We would describe them as neighborhood centers.A lot of people view strip centers as being intrusive to neighborhoods — a lot of parking spaces and obsolete space. Historically, people would build them, lease them up and finance them and really do nothing else. We try to take a long-term approach — to embrace the communities around those centers and bring in retailers that represent the fabric of the community, whether it’s a barber, barista or a butcher. So every single shopping center is personal to that community.

Q. Could you provide examples?A. One unique one in the New York metro area would be a shopping center that we own in Port Jefferson on Long Island. We bought it in 2005; it had been owned by a family for more than 40 years. We remerchandised the center. We brought in Uncle Giuseppe’s Marketplace, which is a great gourmet Italian grocer, to replace a very traditional, nonperforming grocer. We bought an adjacent office building that was largely vacant; an LA Fitness is going to occupy that.Q. Who are some of your large anchor tenants?A. About 90 percent of our neighborhood centers are anchored by grocery stores — Stop and Shop, Giant, Publix, ShopRite, Whole Foods — and we also have retailers like Target and Bed, Bath and Beyond. About a third of the space is local retailers. Almost all of our retailers are triple-net tenants.

Q. What are your average occupancy and rental rates portfoliowide?A. Occupancy is 93.3 percent.The rents could range anywhere from $12 or $13 to $100. Generally speaking, our average base rent is probably around $20.Q. And debt level?A. We have about 42 percent leverage. It’s an investment-grade level of debt. We believe in being entrepreneurial at the real estate level and very conservative at the balance sheet level.Q. Some might say Edens is an attractive takeover target. A. We’re always being approached by other companies. We want to be building a company that others want to invest in and own, but we think that we can change the future on a standalone basis.

Q. Would you ever consider going public?A. We would consider going public at some point in time, though I would not say it’s in the cards right now.We have been capitalized institutionally now for about 15 years — about 90 percent is owned by our large institutional investors like pension funds — and we believe we would perform very well as a public company.Q. What has been your biggest accomplishment since taking the helm 10 years ago?A. Starting in 2003, we invested heavily in recruiting some really talented individuals from the best undergrad and business schools on the East Coast. We’ve also been bringing talent from outside the real estate industry. The new head of our marketing group was a Procter & Gamble executive. The head of our H.R. group came from Wachovia.And we have four Harvard wrestlers.Q. To help collect the rent?A.  They’re actually not very big.

Details




    This bright summer blue is softened by the textured finish of our signature cotton towelling. Our original resort towelling polo is an OB Hero. With its classic yet modern styling, the Terry is a timeless go to. We think every holiday wardrobe needs towelling and this is a great place to start. Tailored fit. Two-piece collar. Short, buttonless resort placket. Straight hem with side seam vents, extended back hem. 205gram mid-weight, 100% terry towelling cotton. Sourced and manufactured in Europe. Color: blue

History[edit]
Terry Brown is referred to fondly by the band Rush as "Broon" in the liner notes for their albums.[1] This nickname appears in the title of the instrumental piece "Broon's Bane" from their live album Exit...Stage Left. On this same record, Geddy Lee jokingly introduces the song "Jacob's Ladder" as having been written by "T. C. Broonsie", another reference to Brown and a pun on the name of Big Bill Broonzy. He also appears as the (uncredited) voice of the hypnotist on the Dream Theater album Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory.
Brown has also engineered, produced or mixed many other artists, including Jimi Hendrix, Sonny and Cher, Kenny Rogers, Traffic, Joe Cocker, The Who, Rush, Procol Harum, The Troggs, Manfred Mann, Marianne Faithfull, Spencer Davis Group, Donovan, Barbra Streisand, Blue Rodeo, Moist, Max Webster, Klaatu, Thundermug, Fates Warning, Lizzy Borden, Voivod, Ray Stevens, the Bonzo Dog Band, Motherlode, Dr. Music, April Wine, The Stampeders, Michel Pagliaro, Moe Koffman, Alannah Myles, B.B. Gabor, Cirque du Soleil, Dream Theater, Lawrence Gowan, Rough Trade, The Killjoys, FM, Toronto, Ian Thomas, The Mummble Ducks, and Christmas.[2]

History[edit]
Terry Brown is referred to fondly by the band Rush as "Broon" in the liner notes for their albums.[1] This nickname appears in the title of the instrumental piece "Broon's Bane" from their live album Exit...Stage Left. On this same record, Geddy Lee jokingly introduces the song "Jacob's Ladder" as having been written by "T. C. Broonsie", another reference to Brown and a pun on the name of Big Bill Broonzy. He also appears as the (uncredited) voice of the hypnotist on the Dream Theater album Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory.
Brown has also engineered, produced or mixed many other artists, including Jimi Hendrix, Sonny and Cher, Kenny Rogers, Traffic, Joe Cocker, The Who, Rush, Procol Harum, The Troggs, Manfred Mann, Marianne Faithfull, Spencer Davis Group, Donovan, Barbra Streisand, Blue Rodeo, Moist, Max Webster, Klaatu, Thundermug, Fates Warning, Lizzy Borden, Voivod, Ray Stevens, the Bonzo Dog Band, Motherlode, Dr. Music, April Wine, The Stampeders, Michel Pagliaro, Moe Koffman, Alannah Myles, B.B. Gabor, Cirque du Soleil, Dream Theater, Lawrence Gowan, Rough Trade, The Killjoys, FM, Toronto, Ian Thomas, The Mummble Ducks, and Christmas.[2]
Albums Terry Brown was involved with[edit]
Brown has been a musician, recording supervisor, engineer, arranger, producer since the mid-1960s.[3]
