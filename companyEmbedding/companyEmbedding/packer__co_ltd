Packer and Co - Investment Management

Unit Price June 2017 $2.1015



Investment Management
Packer & Co commenced investing funds on behalf of clients in 1993. Since 1996 we have managed a single investment vehicle, the Packer & Co Investigator Trust, a unit trust which is able to invest in a broad spectrum of asset classes throughout the world.
The Packer & Co management team tends to be counter-cyclical, buying assets when they are out of favour and taking advantage by selling when investors become over-exuberant. We prefer to keep things simple and avoid options, futures and complex financial products.
We believe in aligning ourselves with our clients and our investment managers have the majority of their personal wealth invested in the Investigator Trust.
VALUE OF $1 INVESTED SINCE INCEPTION


The above graph represents how A$1 invested with  Packer & Co in December 1993 has grown assuming the reinvestment of all distributions. From 1993 to 1996 the returns of the portfolios managed by Packer & Co were used and from then on the returns of the Investigator Trust. Our returns are net of all fees and costs.

GUMMED PAPER TAPE & DISPENSERS
Why use gummed paper tape?

Gummed paper tape has seen a recent rise in popularity as many companies looking to reduce their environmental footprint have also recognised the additional benefits that gummed paper tape has to offer.
Bonds with added strength
When wet, the adhesives in gummed paper tape penetrate into the fibre of the carton and form an integral bond. The tape becomes part of the carton, adding strength to the structure and blending with the character of the cardboard to provide a superior level of presentation compared with plastic tape.

 Improved security
Unlike standard plastic packaging tapes, gummed paper tape cannot be removed from a carton without leaving signs of damage, improving the security of the contents and providing evidence that a package seal has been tampered with.
Fully recyclable
Gummed paper tape is the environmentally friendly choice. Made from renewable natural resources, it is completely bio-degradable and fully recyclable.
Performs in all temperatures
The seal achieved with gummed paper tape maintains its integrity even in the most extreme temperatures and humid conditions. The ideal solution for long-term storage, it is also extremely resistant to ageing.
Cost effective
Did you know that gummed paper tape is cheaper per linear metre than most normal packaging tapes? You can also save money by using less: in most instances, only one strip of gummed paper tape is needed to do the job of several strips of cheap plastic tape. Our dispensers make it even more cost effective, as they accurately measure tape lengths to avoid wastage.
Up productivity, reduce fatigue
Using gummed paper tape with our Cyklop dispensers can result in increased productivity and reduced operator fatigue, compared with using plastic tape and manual dispensers. Hand held plastic tape dispensers can easily be dropped, often resulting in tape damage causing the item to be discarded. Gummed paper tape dispensers protect the tape from this, and the increased roll lengths of GPT reduce the downtime when changing tape rolls.

WASHINGTON, March 2, 2017 – Ohio Farms Packing Co. Ltd., a Creston, Ohio establishment, is recalling approximately 40,680 pounds of boneless veal products that may be contaminated with E. coli  O103, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) announced today. Also included in the recall is an undetermined amount of veal cutlets produced by Ohio Farms Packing Co. Ltd. All of the cutlets were sold to food services; none of this product was sold directly to consumers. Companies that purchase products from Ohio Farms Packing Co. Ltd. should contact the firm directly to determine whether or not the product they have purchased is subject to the recall. 
The boneless veal products were produced Nov. 30, 2016 through Feb. 3, 2017. The following products are subject to recall: [View Label (PDF Only)]

60-lb boxes of “Atlantic Veal & Lamb Inc.: Boneless Veal SF” with product codes:


511012
511020
511021

60-lb boxes of “Atlantic Veal & Lamb LLC: Boneless Veal” with product codes:


507023
507030
507335
507342
507356
507358



The products subject to recall bear establishment number “EST. 34569” inside the USDA mark of inspection. These items were shipped to distributors in Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas and Canada.
The problem was discovered when FSIS was notified by the Illinois State Department of Agriculture about a positive non-0157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli sample.
There have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.
Many clinical laboratories do not test for non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), such as STEC O103 because it is harder to identify than STEC O157. People can become ill from STECs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. Most people infected with STEC O103 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. Some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. Infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. Vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.
Most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is uncommon with STEC O103 infection. HUS can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. It is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. Persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.
FSIS and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in customer’s freezers.
Customers who have purchased these products are urged not to use them. These products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
FSIS routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. When available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the FSIS website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.
FSIS advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground veal that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° F. The only way to confirm that veal is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature. Safe minimal cooking temperatures can be found at http://1.usa.gov/1cDxcDQ.
Media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Shawn Peerless, COO of Ohio Farms Packing Co. Ltd., at (718) 599-6400.
Consumers with food safety questions can "Ask Karen," the FSIS virtual representative available 24 hours a day at AskKaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov. The toll-free USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline 1-888-MPHotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in English and Spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday. Recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day. The online Electronic Consumer Complaint Monitoring System can be accessed 24 hours a day at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/reportproblem. 
 



PREPARING PRODUCT FOR SAFE CONSUMPTION
USDA Meat and Poultry Hotline
1-888-MPHOTLINE or visit
www.fsis.usda.gov
Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. Wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. Immediately clean spills.
Keep raw meat, fish, and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and egg products and cooked foods.
Color is NOT a reliable indicator that meat has been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria. 
The only way to be sure the meat or poultry is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use a thermometer to measure the internal temperature.
- Fish: 145°F
- Beef, pork, lamb chops/steaks/roasts: 145°F with a three minute rest time
- Ground meat: 160°F
- Poultry: 165°F
- Hot dogs: 160°F or steaming hot
Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase or one hour if temperatures exceed 90º F. Refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.











USDA Recall Classifications


Class I
This is a health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death.


Class II
This is a health hazard situation where there is a remote probability of adverse health consequences from the use of the product.


Class III
This is a situation where the use of the product will not cause adverse health consequences.

 Retail Distribution Lists
FSIS has reason to believe that the retail locations listed received the recalled meat or poultry products described in the news release.
Lists may not include all retail locations that have received the recalled product or may include retail locations that did not actually receive the recalled product. Therefore, it is important that you use the product-specific identification information in the news release, in addition to this list of retail stores, to check meat or poultry products in your possession to see if they have been recalled.
For large volume recalls, it may take several days to assemble the initial list. Lists may be updated as additional information becomes available.
"No retail sales" indicates that no retailers were identified for the recall in question. For example, the product may have gone exclusively to restaurants and institutions, and in this case there would be no retailers in the distribution chain.
Finally, FSIS will provide lists when retail sales are associated with a Class I recall. There will be no distribution lists associated with Class II or Class III recalls.

Energized by our "creativity and challenge" motto,
our quest is to become a "total planner and provider of packaging systems"
For more than four decades, since its establishment in 1961, General Packer Co., Ltd. has specialized in the development, manufacture, and sale of automatic packaging machines.
Japanese packaging machine technologies "came of age" in the 1960s. General Packer quickly took the lead in developing technologies for packaging flour and other powdered products. Since then, we have built a solid business foundation, having shipped our products to more than 2,000 corporate customers in Japan and overseas. Indeed, we are renowned for our technological edge and product quality. Our original "set-up type" pouch filling-sealing machines for milled products, cakes, candies, biscuits, and other "dry" goods have captured the top industry position, and we also have an overwhelming lead in serving customers in the dried bonito, milled product, and ice-making industries.
We are mobilizing our accumulated original technologies and product development expertise to broaden our business domain. Leveraging our expertise in food-related machines, we have expanded into equipment for packaging health food, medicines, and medical supplies, expanding our share of new markets in the process.

Business description
We specialize in the manufacture and sale of automatic packaging machines for dry goods such as powder, granular and solid matter for food, chemical and medical products, etc.Dry goods includes, specifically, bagged confectionary items, flour, rice seasoning, dried bonito flakes, rice, health food, pet food, etc. which are sold in supermarkets, convenience stores, and drug stores as well as hardware stores.Our specialty is machines that pack products for which packaging is not easy (for instance light-weight items of various shapes) as well as goods requiring high-quality packing. We also have commercialized many types of packing machines that apply a zipper closure (to be used after package has been opened) and a zippered pouch that can stand on its own. Such bags have become quite popular recently.The packing machines and systems that we develop, design and manufacture have been installed in factories that produce mainly food, chemicals and medical supplies. The products packed by our machines at each factory are delivered to distribution outlets and then sold to consumers.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
