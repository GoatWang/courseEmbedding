This policy covers all sums (inclusive of defence costs) which the insured becomes legally liable to pay as damages as a consequence. 

Highlights
This policy covers all sums (inclusive of defence costs) which the insured 
becomes legally liable to pay as damages as a consequence of:


accidental death/ bodily injury or disease to any third party.

accidental damage to property belonging to a third party.

arising out of any defect in the product manufactured by the insured and 
specifically mentioned in the policy after such product has left the insured's 
premises.
The policy offers the benefit of retroactive period on continuous renewal of 
policy whereby claims reported in subsequent renewal but pertaining to earlier 
period after first inception of policy, also become payable.
Top

Scope
The defect in the product may be a manufacturing defect or may even be due to 
faulty packaging, delivery specifications or instructions as to use of the 
product.
The policy covers the sales turnover of the company- both domestic and/or 
exports.
The policy is on a claims made basis i.e. the claims must arise and be made in 
writing on the insurance company during the policy period.
The policy does not cover any liability for product recall, product guarantee, 
pure financial loss such as loss of goodwill or loss of market. The policy also 
does not pay for the cost incurred for repairing or reconditioning or modifying 
the defective part of the product.
Top

Add on covers
The policy can be extended to cover liability arising out of judgments or 
					settlements made in countries which operate under the laws of U.S.A or Canada 
					(which is an exclusion under the policy) by opting for the North American 
					Jurisdiction Clause.
The policy can also be extended to cover Limited Vendors Liability for named or 
					unnamed vendors. Limited vendors liability means liability arising out of the 
					sale and distribution of named insured products by vendors with original 
					warranties and instructions of use of the product specified by the 
					manufacturers.
Top

Who can take the policy?
The policy can be taken by the manufacturer of any product whether it be the 
					final product or part of the final product.
Top

How to select the sum insured?
In Product Liability Policy, the sum insured is referred to as Limit of 
Indemnity. This limit is fixed per accident and per policy period which is 
called Any One Accident (AOA) limit and Any One Year (AOY) limit respectively. 
The ratio of AOA limit to AOY limit can be chosen from the following:

1:1
1:2
1:3
1:4

The AOA limit which is the maximum amount payable for each accident should be 
fixed taking into account the nature of product covered and the maximum number 
of people who could be affected and maximum property damage that could occur, 
in the worst possible accident after sale of the product.
Top

How to claim?
In case of any event likely to give rise to a liability claim as described 
above, insurance company should be informed immediately. In case any legal 
notice or summons is received, it should be sent to the insurance company. The 
company has the option of arranging the defence of the case.
The event giving rise to the claim should have occurred during the period of 
insurance or retroactive period and the claim first made in writing against the 
insured during the policy period. The maximum amount payable including defence 
cost will be the AOA limit selected. The Any One Year limit will get reduced by 
the amount of claim or indemnity paid for any one accident. Any number of such 
claims made during the policy period will be covered subject to the total 
indemnity not exceeding the Any One Year limit.

 Questions   Do I need to know about securities laws to set up an LLC?   How many people do I need to form an LLC?   Who should form an LLC?   How do I form an LLC?   Do I need a lawyer to form an LLC?   Does my LLC need an operating agreement?   How are LLCs taxed?   What are the differences between a limited liability company and a partnership?   Can I convert my existing business to an LLC?   What is an LLC?     Do I need to know about securities laws to set up an LLC?  If you'll be the sole owner of your LLC and you don't plan to take investments from outsiders, your ownership interest in the LLC will not be considered a "security," and you don't have to concern yourself with these laws.For co-owned LLCs, however, the answer to this question is not so clear. A security is an investment in a profit-making enterprise that is not run by the investor. If a person invests in a business with the expectation of making money from the efforts of others, that person's investment is generally considered a "security" under federal and state law. Conversely, when a person will rely on his or her own efforts to make a profit (that is, he or she will be an active owner of an LLC), that person's ownership interest in the company will not usually be treated as a security.How does this apply to you? Generally, if all of the owners will actively manage the LLC -- which is typical in most small start-up LLCs -- the LLC ownership interests will not be considered securities. But if one or more of your co-owners will not work for the company or play an active role in managing the company -- as may be true for LLCs that accept investments from friends and family or that are run by a special management group -- your LLC's ownership interests may be treated as securities by your state and by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).If your ownership interests are considered securities, you must qualify for an exemption from the state and federal securities laws before the initial owners of your LLC invest their money. If you don't fall within an exemption to the securities laws, you must register the sale of your LLC's ownership interests with the SEC and your state.Fortunately, smaller LLCs, even those that plan to sell memberships to passive investors, usually qualify for securities law exemptions. For example, SEC rules exempt the private sale of securities if all owners reside in one state and all sales are made within the state; this is called the "intrastate offering" exemption. Another federal exemption covers "private offerings." A private offering is an unadvertised sale that is limited to a small number of people (35 or fewer) or to those who, because of their net worth or income earning capacity, can reasonably be expected to be able to take care of themselves in the investment process. Most states have enacted their own versions of these popular federal exemptions.For more information about SEC exemptions, visit the SEC website at www.sec.gov. A quick way to research your state's exemption rules is to go to the home page of your state's securities agency, which typically posts the state's exemptions rules and procedures. To find your state securities agency, go to your secretary of state's website.If your business doesn't qualify for an exemption, you may want to explore other ways of raising money. See Nolo's Business Financing FAQ for more information.    How many people do I need to form an LLC?  You can form an LLC in any state with just one owner. For more information on forming an LLC, see Nolo's article How to Form an LLC.      Who should form an LLC?  You should consider forming an LLC if you are concerned about personal exposure to lawsuits or debts arising from your business. For example, if you decide to open a store-front business that deals directly with the public, you may worry that your commercial liability insurance won't fully protect your personal assets from potential slip-and-fall lawsuits or claims by your suppliers for unpaid bills. Running your business as an LLC may help you sleep better, because it gives you personal protection against these and other potential claims against your business.Not all businesses can operate as LLCs, however. Businesses in the banking, trust, and insurance industry, for example, are typically prohibited from forming LLCs. In addition, some states, including California, prohibit professionals such as architects, accountants, doctors, and licensed healthcare workers from forming LLCs.You can also get limited liability for your business by forming a corporation. For information on the differences between these two business structures, see Nolo's article Corporations vs. LLCs. For more information on forming an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC.    How do I form an LLC?  In most states, you create an LLC simply by filing "articles of organization" with your state's LLC filing office (which is usually part of the secretary of state's office) and paying a filing fee. A few states refer to this organizational document as a "certificate of organization" or a "certificate of formation." Most states provide a fill-in-the-blank form that takes just a few minutes to prepare. You can obtain the form by mail or download it from your state's website (check your state's secretary of state or corporations division home page). A few states impose an additional requirement: Prior to filing your articles of organization, you must publish your intention to form an LLC in a local newspaper. You'll also want to prepare an LLC operating agreement, though it isn't legally required in most states. Your operating agreement explicitly states the rights and responsibilities of the LLC owners. The main reasons to do this are to clarify your business arrangements and to decide how your LLC will be run. If you don't create a written operating agreement, the LLC laws of your state will govern the inner workings of your LLC. More Information You can use a self-help book or software program to guide you through the process of creating personalized articles of organization and writing an LLC operating agreement. For more information, see Nolo's articles How to Form an LLC or 50-State Guide to Forming an LLC. To form your LLC right now, use Nolo's online formation service, which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state.    Do I need a lawyer to form an LLC?  No. All states allow business owners to form their own LLC by filing articles of organization. In most states, the information you must provide for the articles of organization is very basic -- typically, you have to supply the name of the LLC, the location of its principal office, the names and addresses of the LLC's owners, and the name and address of the LLC's registered agent (a person or company that agrees to accept legal papers on behalf of the LLC).Now that most states provide downloadable fill-in-the-blank forms and instructions, the process is even easier. And LLC filing offices are becoming more accustomed to dealing directly with business owners; they often allow business owners to email questions to them directly.Of course, if you're trying to decide whether the LLC is the right structure for your business, you may want to consult an expert. You may also want an expert to review your operating agreement or set up your bookkeeping and accounting systems. Our website features an online lawyer directory as a free resource to our customers. Comprehensive profiles of attorneys in your state can be found at  www.nolo.com.    Does my LLC need an operating agreement?  Although most states' LLC laws don't require a written operating agreement, you shouldn't consider starting business without one. Here's why an operating agreement is necessary:It helps to ensure that courts will respect your personal liability protection by showing that you have been conscientious about organizing your LLC as a legitimate business.It sets out rules that govern how profits will be split up, how major business decisions will be made, and the procedures for handling the departure and addition of members.It helps to avert misunderstandings among the owners over finances and management.It allows you to create your own operating rules rather than being governed by the default rules in your state's LLC laws, which might not be to your benefit.For more information, see Nolo's article The LLC Operating Agreement.    How are LLCs taxed?  Like sole proprietorships (one-owner businesses) and partnerships, an LLC is not considered a separate entity from its owners for tax purposes. This means that the LLC does not generally pay any income taxes itself; instead, the LLC owners pay taxes on their allocated share of profits (or deduct their share of business losses) on their personal tax returns.LLC owners can elect to have their LLC taxed like a corporation. This may reduce taxes for LLC owners who need to retain a significant amount of profits in the company. For more on reporting and paying taxes as an LLC owner, see How LLCs Are Taxed.     What are the differences between a limited liability company and a partnership?  The main difference between an LLC and a partnership is that LLC owners are not personally liable for the company's debts and liabilities. This means that creditors of the LLC usually cannot go after the owners' personal assets to pay off LLC debts. Partners, on the other hand, do not receive this limited liability protection unless they are designated "limited" partners in their partnership agreement.Also, owners of limited liability companies must file formal articles of organization with their state's LLC filing office, pay a filing fee, and comply with certain other state filing requirements before they open for business. By contrast, people who form a partnership don't need to file any formal paperwork or pay any special fees.LLCs and partnerships are almost identical when it comes to taxation, however. In both types of businesses, the owners report business income or losses on their personal tax returns; the business itself does not pay tax on this money. In fact, LLC and partnerships file the same informational tax return with the IRS (Form 1065) and distribute the same schedules to the business's owners (Schedule K-1, which lists each owner's share of income).For more information on LLCs, see the Limited Liability Companies section of Nolo's website. To learn more about partnerships, see the Partnerships  section. Finally, for guidance on deciding which ownership structure is most suitable for your business, read Nolo's article Choosing the Best Ownership Structure for Your Business.    Can I convert my existing business to an LLC?  Yes. Converting a sole proprietorship or a partnership to an LLC is an easy way for sole proprietors and partners to protect their personal assets without changing the way their business income is taxed.Some states provide a simple form for converting a partnership to an LLC (often called a "certificate of conversion"). Sole proprietors and partners in states that don't provide a conversion form must file regular articles of organization to create an LLC.In some states, before a partnership can officially convert to an LLC, it must publish a notice in a local newspaper that the partnership is being terminated. And in all states, you'll have to transfer all identification numbers, licenses, and permits to the name of your new LLC, including:your federal employer identification numberyour state employer identification numberyour sales tax permityour business license (or tax registration), andany professional licenses or permits.For general information on forming an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC.    What is an LLC?  A limited liability company, commonly called an "LLC," is a business structure that combines the pass-through taxation of a partnership or sole proprietorship with the limited liability of a corporation. Like owners of partnerships or sole proprietorships, LLC owners report business profits or losses on their personal income tax returns; the LLC itself is not a separate taxable entity. Like owners of a corporation, however, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims -- a feature known as "limited liability." This means that if the business owes money or faces a lawsuit, only the assets of the business itself are at risk. Creditors usually can't reach the personal assets of the LLC owners, such as a house or car. (Both LLC owners and corporate shareholders can lose this protection by acting illegally, unethically, or irresponsibly.) For these reasons, many people say the LLC combines the best features of the partnership and corporate business structures. To learn more about limited liability companies and limited liability, see Nolo's LLC Basics.

How Limited is Limited Liability?
One of the key advantages of a limited liability company (LLC) over a sole proprietorship or general partnership is the fact that the owners (members) of the LLC are not personally liable for the debts and claims of the business.  Normally, that means that if the business is unable to pay a supplier, lender, landlord or other creditor, that person cannot go after the personal assets of the members of the LLC.  The members may lose their entire investment in the business, but their other assets - car, home, and personal bank accounts - are safe from the creditors of the business.
Or are they?  In truth, there are many exceptions to the rule of limited liability. Many LLC members will find that, due to the way the business was operated, the promised protection from the liabilities and claims of the business is not meaningful.
How Personal Liability Arises
A member of an LLC can be held personally liable for many different types of claims, but they typically arise under four different scenarios:

Claims arising out of an act or omission by the member, such as the member's own negligence, fraud or illegal act
Claims arising out of a contract, particularly one that was personally guaranteed by the member
Claims based on the concept of "piercing the veil" of the LLC
Liability for consenting to or receiving a distribution in violation of the LLC's operating agreement or the applicable LLC statute

These claims are not a result of choosing an LLC as a form of entity.  All of these exceptions apply equally to shareholders in corporations and, in fact, the exceptions were developed first under corporate law.
Actions of a Member
Every member who actively participates in the business of the LLC runs the risk that his action or inaction will result in personal liability.  This is particularly a risk of a service business in which the members provide the key service.  If you are an electrician and you leave an exposed wire that electrocutes someone, your LLC is not going to protect you.  
Similarly, if you make promises about your product or service that are not true, the first claim may be against the LLC for breach of contract, but if the LLC cannot perform or pay damages, the injured party may come after you for fraud or a similar claim based upon your own action.
Even if you have an employee who committed the action, you may not be out of the woods.  If you personally hired the employee, the injured party may have a claim against you for negligent hiring if a reasonable person would not have hired that employee.
A special category of personal liability that may trip up a member of an LLC is failure to pay payroll taxes to the IRS.  To protect these so-called "trust fund taxes," any person who had the ability to prevent the non-payment can be personally liable for the failure to pay these taxes.  The IRS applies this provision broadly, so if you had power to direct which bills got paid and which didn't, you are probably liable.
Claims Based on Contract
Another, and probably more common, source of personal liability for many small business owners is the voluntary assumption of liability, usually by means of a personal guarantee.  For many small businesses, particularly new businesses with no credit history, obtaining a loan without a personal guarantee is virtually impossible.  Landlords, too, often insist on a personal guarantee, particularly if the lease requires the landlord to incur costs such as build-outs that it expects to recoup over the term of the lease.
Suppliers are sometimes more flexible on extending credit, especially after the business is up and running.  Getting payment terms out of the gate, however, often requires a personal guarantee.
Even when the creditor isn't seeking a personal guarantee, a member of the LLC can inadvertently become a party to the contract by failing to clearly note his role. If she signs her own name and does not indicate that she is executing the contract on behalf of the LLC, it is very likely that a court will hold her responsible for the contract. Every contract should clearly indicate that the party to the contract is the LLC (full name!) and should indicate the role of the person who is signing (member or manager).
Piercing the Veil of the LLC
Even if a member avoids personal guarantees, he may find himself liable to creditors of the business under a theory developed under corporate law and known as "piercing the corporate veil." Although the factors that courts look at vary to some extent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, the courts typically look at whether there is a unity of interest and ownership such that the separate personalities of the entity and the owner no longer exists and whether to respect the distinction between the owner and the entity would be an injustice.
In almost all cases of piercing the veil, there is either commingling or diversion of assets.  Some other facts that courts examine in corporate cases include: 

Inadequate capitalization
Failure to issue stock
Failure to observe corporate formalities
Nonpayment of dividends
Insolvency of the debtor corporation at the time
Non-functioning of other officers or directors
Absence of corporate records
Commingling of funds
Diversion of assets
Failure to maintain arm's length relationships among related entities
Whether the corporation is a mere facade for the operation of the dominant shareholders

A possible benefit of an LLC over a corporation is that several of the commonly listed factors (failure to issue stock, failure to observe corporate formalities, and absence of corporate records) have no real counterparts in an LLC.  However, as case law develops, the absence of those factors may simply shift emphasis on some of the other factors.
Distributions in Violation of Law or Agreement
LLC Acts typically prohibit an LLC from making certain distributions.  For example, the final draft of the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act provides that a limited liability company may not make a distribution if after the distribution: (1) the company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of the limited liability company�s activities; or (2) the company�s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved, wound up, and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up, and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those of persons receiving the distribution.
A member of a member-managed limited liability company or manager of a manager-managed limited liability company who consents to an improper distribution  is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which is improper distributions. In addition, a person who receives a distribution knowing that it is in violation of the Act is typically personally liable for the portion of the distribution that is improper.
Is Limited Liability an Illusion?
Although it may seem that the exceptions swallow the rule, the LLC offers excellent protection from many types of 
liabilities.  For example if you properly hire and train an employee who then commits an act of negligence or fraud, the LLC should shield you from personal liability.  If you sell a product that, without your knowledge or fault, is defective, you should not have personal liability.  Trade creditors who deal with the LLC without a personal guarantee should have no right to look to you for payment.
Shoring up Limited Liability
There are several things that you can do to strengthen the protection of limited liability within the LLC:
Business insurance.  Carrying adequate business insurance won't change the fact that you are personally liable for your own negligence, but it can help by providing a source for payment.  You might also consider a personal umbrella policy.
Avoid personal guarantees.  Not all personal guarantees can be avoided but do not automatically consent to every guarantee.  In many cases, landlords or vendors routinely request personal guarantees even where the facts do not dictate that one be provided.  Learn to question the request.
Capitalize the business adequately.  Provide adequate capital for the entity's intended purposes and document the capital infusion.
Keep the LLC separate from your personal business.  No matter how small the business is, it should have its own bank account.  Don't pay personal expenses from the business account.  Instead, write yourself a check (called a draw) on the LLC account and deposit it in your account from which you pay expenses.  Likewise, don't use personal checks to pay LLC bills.  If the LLC needs funds, make a capital contribution or loan.  And account for everything.
Act ethically.  Don't attempt to mislead the LLC's creditors about the financial condition of the business.
Do not divert assets.  If the business looks like it is going down, don't attempt to lessen your own loss by taking big draws or moving assets out of the LLC.  That will only help open the floodgates to your personal assets.
If you act responsibly and take a few precautions, the limited liability of the LLC is still a major benefit over a sole proprietorship or general partnership.

How do I report a claim?


Claims must be reported as soon as reasonably possible.  Please contact us by mail, email, or fax.  
Medmarc Insurance GroupAttn: Claims Reporting14280 Park Meadow Drive, Suite 300Chantilly, Virginia 20151
Email:  ClaimsReporting@Medmarc.com
Fax: (703) 652-1389
If you have questions about whether to report a claim, please refer to your policy, which includes requirements for reporting occurrences, claims, and lawsuits.  Medmarc's claims staff are also available to answer your questions and provide reporting advice.
Please contact our Claims Department at (800) 356-6886.


How do I access my loss information?


You can request a loss run via our Loss Run Request page. Please select “Loss Run Request” in the subject line and submit dates and name of insured in the additional information box.  You must be the Insured or the current Broker of Record to make this request.  You will receive your loss run report within one business day of request. 
Online loss run access is temporarily disabled until we go live with a new online portal later this year. 


How does Medmarc help me select the best defense attorney for my claim?


We have built a network of top-tier attorneys to defend your cases.  All of our attorneys are selected for their expertise in defending medical device and pharmaceutical companies in products liability litigation.  We leverage our buying power in order to secure you with reasonable hourly rates, and our attorneys are required to communicate with you regularly on the status of your claim.
Many of our network counsel have written and lectured on various aspects of product liability.  Some have medical or nursing degrees.  Many also have medical malpractice defense expertise.They are skilled trial attorneys, but they also have negotiating and case resolution skills that can achieve rational business outcomes at mediation and settlement conferences. 


How do I submit changes to our contact information?


Please select subject "Contact Underwriting" in the Request More Information Form on this page. 
Please provide information for your “primary contact,” including your contact’s first and last name, title, address, phone number, fax number, and email address.  If applicable, please also provide this information for any additional contacts for SIR billing, claims, risk management, and loss runs.


How does Medmarc handle a claim or lawsuit outside of the United States?


We have approved network counsel in many foreign countries.  In addition, when servicing foreign claims, we rely on a number of international resources for loss investigation and litigation control.  These include: 

GAB Robins Worldwide
Baker & McKenzie Worldwide Legal Network
Lex Mundi Directory of Foreign Counsel
American Law Firm Association (ALFA)
International Legal Network



What types of coverages does Medmarc provide?




Medmarc offers Products/Completed Operations Liability (“Products Liability”) and Manufacturers’ Errors and Omissions Liability (“E&O”) for medical technology and life sciences companies.
For more information on each coverage type, go to our Insurance Solutions


What kind of product recall coverage is available through Medmarc?


Coverage for FDA recalls may be found in two types of Medmarc coverage offerings. 

Products Liability — Medmarc offers product-withdrawal-expense coverage as an endorsement to our products liability policy.  This endorsement, subject to terms and exclusions, covers expenses incurred by the insured to remove its product from the marketplace due to a Class I product recall, including expenses associated with communicating the recall to the public. 
Manufacturers’ Errors & Omissions (E&O) — Medmarc offers recall coverage for third-party financial loss that results from the insured’s error or omission, such as when the insured’s customer incurs expenses for undertaking a recall that arises as a result of the insured’s negligence in manufacturing or servicing of a product.

Please talk to your Medmarc underwriter if your client has a need for this coverage or would like to learn more. 


What happens when I report a claim?


We typically assign the claim to a claim examiner upon receiving it.  The claim examiner will review and analyze the claim for coverage, liability, and damages issues and contact you normally within 24 hours.  
In litigated cases, we assist you in the selection of defense counsel, with whom we work closely until your matter is resolved.  Your input is crucial to a successful defense strategy, and your claim examiner will update you throughout the life of your claim—but no less frequently than on a quarterly basis—about the progress of bringing your claim to resolution.


Do Medmarc claim examiners specialize in life sciences?


Yes.  Medmarc has a team of experienced claim examiners dedicated to the life sciences industry, who handle only life sciences claims.  Each examiner has a minimum of ten years’ experience and hold a variety of degrees and designations including law degrees, actuarial degrees, and Associate in Claims (AIC) designations.  To remain on the cutting edge of developments in the law and the life sciences, Medmarc’s claim examiners participate regularly in industry educational programs. Medmarc is a proud corporate member of DRI, ALFA, and USLAW organizations.


I am not an insured, but may I still receive risk management assistance from Medmarc?




Our risk management services are intended for use by our insureds.  On a limited basis, however, we will provide products liability risk management services on a fee-for-service basis. 
For more information, please contact our Risk Management Department at RiskManagement@Medmarc.com or at 703-652-1362.


Is the fact that a product is approved by the FDA sufficient enough information about the product to obtain a quote from Medmarc?




FDA approval of a product is important to the underwriting analysis, as is the regulatory history of the company, but it is not sufficient information for Medmarc’s underwriters to provide a coverage quote. In order to understand the company’s risk profile and coverage needs, underwriters also will require information about the company’s size, financial condition, management team, operations, loss history, and other information related to the company’s history and product lines.


What is Medmarc’s capacity?




For Medmarc’s products liability policy, our capacity is $10 million per policy.  For our manufacturers’ errors and omissions (E&O) policy, our capacity is $5 million.  
Capacity is subject to underwriting and is not available for all applicants. 


What is Medmarc's target risk?




Medmarc provides coverage for the manufacturers and distributors of medical devices, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, in vitro diagnostics, personal hygiene products, and animal care products.  We cover both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and contract manufacturers.  We cover companies at every stage of their evolution—from clinical trial-stage startups to multi-national companies with extensive product lines.


What risk management services does Medmarc provide?




Through our Risk Management Department, Medmarc helps medical technology and life sciences companies manage their products liability risks.  We can identify your potential products liability exposures through our risk assessment process and then help you develop and implement strategies to mitigate your risk.  
We provide assistance with areas of your operations that tend to give rise to products liability, such as supply chains, product warnings and instructions for use, and manufacturing procedures.  There is a close association between regulatory compliance and products liability.  For this reason, we offer a variety of services designed to help companies comply with FDA requirements. 
We also provide employee training that is designed to heighten awareness about products liability risk and the impact that it can have on your operations and bottom line.


Will Medmarc accept other carriers’ applications?




Yes.  Medmarc is happy to accept applications from other carriers, but please be aware that we may require additional information.


As a distributor, do I need products liability coverage?




We recommend that distributors purchase their own products liability insurance policies.  If a distributor is required to repackage or install a product, or if the distributor provides training on the use of the product, the distributor may have a potential exposure that is not typically covered under the manufacturer’s policy.  Furthermore, independent acts of negligence on the part of the distributor typically would not be covered under the manufacturer’s policy or by contractual indemnification agreements. A U.S. distributor that imports products from a manufacturer located outside of the United States should be aware that the foreign manufacturer’s policy may not provide coverage in the U.S. or may not provide coverage for the defense of claims in the U.S., which could become very costly.  Medmarc’s Risk Management Department has published an article that explains distributor risks. The article is titled, “Why Distributors May Be More  Vulnerable to Products Liability than They Realize,” and it is available on Medmarc’s website in our Resource Library.


Does your policy cover sales representatives (“sales reps”)?




The actions or omissions of sales reps when acting in the scope of their employment are covered under Medmarc’s products liability insurance coverage. Such circumstances include when sales reps: (1) provide product consultations; (2) make device technical adjustments; (3) are present in operating rooms during surgeries to answer questions deemed essential for patient care; or (4) are present during patient monitoring visits to ensure compliance with clinical trial protocols by surgical staff and nurses.
For more information, see the Ask an Expert by Fran Stockwell, “Do distributors require professional liability insurance coverage in addition to products liability insurance coverage?”
 


Does your policy cover explants of implantable devices?




Our products liability policy covers explantations (i.e., the surgical removal of implantable devices) only when the product causes the patient harm.


What is the difference between a claims-made policy and an occurrence policy?



Insurance coverage can either be on a "claims made" or "occurrence" basis. These terms refer to what the policy covers during the policy period. A claims-made policy provides insurance for claims made during a policy year (or tail period) regardless of when the loss occurred, and an occurrence policy provides insurance for losses that occurred only during the policy year (as specified on the declarations form). A "claims made" policy provides coverage for claims made (and reported) during the policy term as long as they were made after the "retroactive date." (The retroactive date is the start date of the first claims-made policy obtained, so long as it has been kept active (via renewal).) That date remains the same and is not advanced as long as the policy is renewed. For example, if a client first obtains claims-made coverage on October 1, 2008, and it is now 2013 and they've maintained the same coverage, their claims-made policy covers all incidents since October 1, 2008. If the client no longer has coverage in 2014, and a patient sues in 2014 for an incident that occurred in 2008, the client does not have coverage for that incident (unless they purchased tail coverage). 
An "occurrence" policy, in contrast, covers incidents that occur (but are not necessarily reported) during the term the policy is in force. For example, if a client obtained an occurrence policy covering 2008-2009, and a patient is injured by the client's product in 2009, but does not sue for their injuries until 2011, the client has coverage from their 2008-2009 policy, even if they are no longer insured.


Will Medmarc provide coverage for non-medical products?




Because of our familiarity and long-standing connection with this industry, we recognize that life sciences companies sometimes have product lines that include non-medical products. Often, we can accommodate this coverage need.  Your Medmarc underwriter can answer any questions you might have about covering non-medical products and will walk you through specific coverage options for your insureds.


What information do you need to assess a clinical trial risk?




For clinical trial submissions, include the draft or final study protocol and the patient informed consent document in order to expedite our review.


How do I obtain a quote for manufacturers' errors and omissions (E&O) coverage from Medmarc?




The E&O application can be found here. Along with a completed application, your Medmarc underwriter simply needs a sample of your client’s contracts or purchase orders that they use with their customers.


How does Medmarc calculate minimum premiums?




Minimum premiums differ depending on several factors, such as a product’s risk profile and the state in which the company is located. 
If you have a small account and are interested discussing the cost of coverage in greater detail, please call George Ayd at (703) 652-1309.


What is Medmarc’s financial strength?




A.M. Best* Rating A (Excellent) With a Stable Outlook.
According to A.M. Best, an A (Excellent) rated company has "an excellent ability to meet their ongoing responsibilities to policyholders."
The stable outlook indicates "that [the company] is experiencing stable financial and market trends, and that there is a low likelihood that its rating will change in the near-term". 
For more information check out our Financial Strength page.

What is an LLC?
Like a corporation, a limited liability company (or "LLC"), is a separate and distinct legal entity.  This means that an LLC can have its own tax identification number and bank account.  The primary advantage of an LLC is that its owners have "limited liability," meaning that, under most circumstances, the owners are not personally liable for the liabilities and debts of the LLC.  For example, if an LLC is forced into bankruptcy, the owners will not be required to pay the LLC's debts with their own money.  If the assets of the LLC are not enough to cover the debts and liabilities, the creditors generally cannot look to the owners, managers or officers for relief.

An LLC can be taxed either as a "pass-through" entity, like a sole proprietorship or partnership, or as a regular corporation.  By default, an LLC is taxed as a pass-through entity, where the owners just pay taxes on the profits of the LLC at their individual 
tax rates.  This is different from a regular C Corporation, which pays a corporate tax on its net income before distributing profits to the stockholders (the owners) as dividends.  When the corporation distributes profits, the stockholders 
also must pay income tax on these dividends.  Most LLC owners choose to have the profits pass-through so that taxes are only paid once on the profits. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential personal and business legal documents themselves.

What are some common reasons for changing your legal name? 

Personal Choice.  You may simply not like your name or may want a name that is more easily spelled or pronounced. With TotalLegal, you can change your last name, first name and/or middle name.
Change a Child's Name.  The absence of a parent in a child's life, changes in parental rights/custody, and paternity determinations are among the most common reasons to change a child's name.
Share a Last Name.  Couples may want to create a hyphenated or entirely new last name for themselves.
Divorce.  If you took your spouse's last name upon marriage, you may want to resume a former name if you separate or divorce. In most states, it is easy to include a name change in your Divorce Decree.


Fraud and Name Changes.  The court will not grant a name change that 
		is requested for a fraudulent or illegal purpose such as evading criminal 
		prosecution or a civil lawsuit, avoiding creditors, or identity theft. 
TotalLegal™ has helped over 1 million people nationwide make essential documents themselves.
