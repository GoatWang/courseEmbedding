HOME > About Us > CEO > CEO's Message 









I would like to express my sincere gratitude for your unwavering support and confidence in Samsung Asset Management.
Samsung Asset Management is the lead representative asset management company in Korea.  
					For the first time in the industry, our assets under management exceeded the KRW 100 trillion mark in 2011, and we have continued with explosive growth of our AUM.  
					As of January 2015, our AUM stands at a towering KRW 180 trillion, and still remains to be unmatched by any of our local competitors.
For this enormous AUM growth, we have invested heavily with enormous efforts to develop advanced management techniques, building a systematic and proprietary risk management system, along with the best in-class talent acquisition and training, including tangible and intangible infrastructure.
We are highly confident in our innovative product development capabilities.  
					In 2014, we launched the industry's first innovative fund products. 
					The "Samsung Value Plus Fund", which applies the M&A concept, and the "Samsung ELS Index Fund", that complement investment risks and disadvantages of ELS products.
In addition, as the leading asset management company in Korea, we create new markets in areas such as ETFs and hedge funds.
In 2002, Samsung Asset Management initiated the first ETF in Korea.  
					The Korean ETF market has grown from KRW 200 billion to KRW 20 trillion presently.
With ETF being a major financial instrument, Samsung Asset Management has led the market with continuous investment and product development.  In particular, the "KODEX Leverage ETF" and the "KODEX Inverse ETF" are some of our crucial core offerings which have changed the paradigm for various investment appetites.
The Korean hedge fund market launched in December 2011, and Samsung Asset Management is the industry's "No. 1" leader, recording stable rates of returns on the basis of low volatility.  
					In particular, many pension funds, corporations have entrusted their confidence in us, 
					as we continue to lead the Korean hedge fund market and seek to develop new product lineups that are catered for absolute returns.
Based on these competitive edges, Samsung Asset Management pledges to a new start to leap forward as the global player for asset management in addition to maintaining the top spot in the local industry.  We are in the process of completing our global management integration with the merger of our London, Hong Kong and New York satellite offices, to provide 24-hour investment coverage. 
We will continue to strengthen our global research capability to develop new products such as global bond, and global asset allocation products.
Most importantly, Samsung Asset Management will continue to be innovative and progressive for providing investment solutions and services catered for various investment appetites.
We greatly value the trust that our investors have placed with us and will continuously strive to maintain this high level of commitment to you, placing your interests first.
We look forward to your continued support and interest in Samsung Asset Management.
Thank You.
Sunghoon Koo. Chief Executive Officer. Samsung Asset Management Co., Ltd.

Samsung Life Insurance (Korean: 삼성생명보험, ) is a South Korean multinational insurance company headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, and a subsidiary of the Samsung Group. It is the largest insurance company in South Korea and a Fortune Global 500 company.[3][4]
Samsung Life's principal products include life, health insurance and annuities. Samsung Life was a private company from its foundation in 1957 until it went public in May 2010. The IPO was the largest in South Korean history and made Samsung Life one of the country's most valuable companies measured by market capitalization.[5] Its headquarters are situated across from Namdaemun, a historic gate located in the heart of Seoul.

History[edit]
Founded in 1957, the company quickly grew and attained a market leading position after just 18 months of operations. Since then, Samsung Life Insurance has maintained its market leadership in the industry through product innovation, marketing, and distribution. In particular, the growth was accelerated after the company was incorporated under Samsung Group in 1963.[6]
In 1986, the company opened representative offices in New York and Tokyo. It has also expanded in overseas operation through a joint venture in Thailand in 1997 and China in 2005. The company was the first life insurance company in Korea to achieve KRW 100 Trillion Won in assets in 2006.[6] On May 12, 2010, Samsung Life Insurance went public and the shares went for 110,000 won, or $96/share in one of the largest initial offerings and a record for the country, raising $4.4 billion.[5]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
