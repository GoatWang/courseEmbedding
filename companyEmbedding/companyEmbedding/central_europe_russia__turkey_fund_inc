Investment return and principal value fluctuate with changing market conditions so when sold, shares may be worth more or less that the original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Please call (800) GERMANY and speak to a representative to obtain the fund’s most recent performance.Total return based on market price reflects changes in market value. Total return based on net asset value reflects changes in the fund’s net asset value during each period. Each figure assumes that dividends and capital gains, if any, were reinvested. These figures will differ depending on the level of any discount from or premium to NAV at which the fund’s shares traded during the period. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, are not continuously offered. There is a one time public offering and once issued, shares of closed-end funds are sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of the fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, the fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Returns during part or all of the periods shown reflect a fee and/or expense waiver. Without this waiver, returns would have been lower and any rankings/ratings might have been less favorable. Expenses of the fund include investment advisory and administration fees and other fund expenses.

The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. Announces Results of 
      Annual Meeting of Stockholders






July 25, 2017 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. (NYSE:CEE) (the 
      “Fund”) announced today the results of its Joint Annual Meeting of 
      Stockholders, which was initially called to order and adjourned on June 
      27, 2017 and reconvened on July 25, 2017.
    

      Stockholders approved the proposed (i) change to the Fund’s investment 
      objective from seeking “long-term capital appreciation through 
      investment primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of issuers 
      domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey” to seeking “long-term 
      capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity and 
      equity-linked securities of issuers domiciled in Central and Eastern 
      Europe;” (ii) change to the Fund’s corresponding fundamental investment 
      policy to provide that, “[u]nder normal circumstances, the Fund will 
      invest at least 80% of the Fund’s net assets (plus borrowings used for 
      investment purposes) in securities of issuers domiciled in Central and 
      Eastern Europe;” and (iii) change to the Fund’s fundamental investment 
      policies to require the Fund to invest more than 25% of its total assets 
      in the securities of issuers in the energy sector. The changes to the 
      Fund’s investment objective and fundamental investment policies will be 
      implemented effective August 1, 2017. Effective the close of business on 
      July 31, 2017, the Fund’s benchmark will be changed to the MSCI Emerging 
      Markets Eastern Europe Index and the Fund’s name will be changed to “The 
      Central and Eastern Europe Fund, Inc.” There will be no changes to the 
      Fund’s ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange or the CUSIP number 
      for its shares. The Fund previously announced that, prior to the 
      adjournment of the meeting on June 27, 2017, stockholders elected four 
      Directors and approved the appointment of independent auditors.
    

Important Information


The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. is a 
      non-diversified, closed-end investment company seeking long term capital 
      appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked 
      securities of issuers domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey. 
      Because the Fund is non-diversified, it can take larger positions in 
      fewer issuers than a diversified fund, increasing its potential risk.


Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging 
      markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, 
      political and economic changes, and market risks. Any fund that 
      concentrates in a particular segment of the market or in a particular 
      geographical region will generally be more volatile than a fund that 
      invests more broadly.


The shares of most closed-end funds, including the Fund, are not 
      continuously offered. Once issued, shares of closed-end funds are 
      bought and sold in the open market. Shares of closed-end funds 
      frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of a 
      fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are 
      beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, a fund cannot predict 
      whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.


Investments in funds involve risk. Additional risks of the 
      Fund are associated with international investing, such as currency 
      fluctuations, political and economic changes, market risks, government 
      regulations and differences in liquidity, which may increase the 
      volatility of your investment. Foreign security markets generally 
      exhibit greater price volatility and are less liquid than the US market.
Additionally, the Fund focuses its investments in certain 
      geographical regions, thereby increasing its vulnerability to 
      developments in those regions and potentially subjecting the Fund’s 
      shares to greater price volatility. Some funds have more risk 
      than others. These include funds, such as the Fund, that allow 
      exposure to or otherwise concentrate investments in certain sectors, 
      geographic regions, security types, market capitalization or foreign 
      securities (e.g., political or economic instability, which can be 
      accentuated in emerging market countries).


The European Union, the United States and other countries have 
      imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of the Russian military 
      intervention in the Ukraine. These sanctions have adversely 
      affected Russian individuals, Russian issuers and the Russian economy.
Russia, in turn, has imposed sanctions targeting Western individuals, 
      businesses and products, including food products. The various 
      sanctions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, 
      not only the Russian economy, but also the economies of many countries 
      in Europe, including Germany and other countries in Central and Eastern 
      Europe. Potential developments in the Ukraine, and the 
      continuation of current sanctions or the imposition of additional 
      sanctions may materially adversely affect the value of the Fund’s 
      portfolio.


This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a 
      solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in 
      any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale 
      would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws 
      of such state or jurisdiction.


Certain statements contained in this release may be forward-looking 
      in nature. These include all statements relating to plans, 
      expectations, and other statements that are not historical facts 
      and typically use words like “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” 
      “intend,” and similar expressions. Such statements represent 
      management’s current beliefs, based upon information available at the
time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed.
All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such 
      statements. Management does not undertake any obligation to 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a 
      result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. Announces Results of 
      Annual Meeting of Stockholders






July 25, 2017 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. (NYSE:CEE) (the 
      “Fund”) announced today the results of its Joint Annual Meeting of 
      Stockholders, which was initially called to order and adjourned on June 
      27, 2017 and reconvened on July 25, 2017.
    

      Stockholders approved the proposed (i) change to the Fund’s investment 
      objective from seeking “long-term capital appreciation through 
      investment primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of issuers 
      domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey” to seeking “long-term 
      capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity and 
      equity-linked securities of issuers domiciled in Central and Eastern 
      Europe;” (ii) change to the Fund’s corresponding fundamental investment 
      policy to provide that, “[u]nder normal circumstances, the Fund will 
      invest at least 80% of the Fund’s net assets (plus borrowings used for 
      investment purposes) in securities of issuers domiciled in Central and 
      Eastern Europe;” and (iii) change to the Fund’s fundamental investment 
      policies to require the Fund to invest more than 25% of its total assets 
      in the securities of issuers in the energy sector. The changes to the 
      Fund’s investment objective and fundamental investment policies will be 
      implemented effective August 1, 2017. Effective the close of business on 
      July 31, 2017, the Fund’s benchmark will be changed to the MSCI Emerging 
      Markets Eastern Europe Index and the Fund’s name will be changed to “The 
      Central and Eastern Europe Fund, Inc.” There will be no changes to the 
      Fund’s ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange or the CUSIP number 
      for its shares. The Fund previously announced that, prior to the 
      adjournment of the meeting on June 27, 2017, stockholders elected four 
      Directors and approved the appointment of independent auditors.
    

Important Information


The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. is a 
      non-diversified, closed-end investment company seeking long term capital 
      appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked 
      securities of issuers domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey. 
      Because the Fund is non-diversified, it can take larger positions in 
      fewer issuers than a diversified fund, increasing its potential risk.


Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging 
      markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, 
      political and economic changes, and market risks. Any fund that 
      concentrates in a particular segment of the market or in a particular 
      geographical region will generally be more volatile than a fund that 
      invests more broadly.


The shares of most closed-end funds, including the Fund, are not 
      continuously offered. Once issued, shares of closed-end funds are 
      bought and sold in the open market. Shares of closed-end funds 
      frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of a 
      fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are 
      beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, a fund cannot predict 
      whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.


Investments in funds involve risk. Additional risks of the 
      Fund are associated with international investing, such as currency 
      fluctuations, political and economic changes, market risks, government 
      regulations and differences in liquidity, which may increase the 
      volatility of your investment. Foreign security markets generally 
      exhibit greater price volatility and are less liquid than the US market.
Additionally, the Fund focuses its investments in certain 
      geographical regions, thereby increasing its vulnerability to 
      developments in those regions and potentially subjecting the Fund’s 
      shares to greater price volatility. Some funds have more risk 
      than others. These include funds, such as the Fund, that allow 
      exposure to or otherwise concentrate investments in certain sectors, 
      geographic regions, security types, market capitalization or foreign 
      securities (e.g., political or economic instability, which can be 
      accentuated in emerging market countries).


The European Union, the United States and other countries have 
      imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of the Russian military 
      intervention in the Ukraine. These sanctions have adversely 
      affected Russian individuals, Russian issuers and the Russian economy.
Russia, in turn, has imposed sanctions targeting Western individuals, 
      businesses and products, including food products. The various 
      sanctions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, 
      not only the Russian economy, but also the economies of many countries 
      in Europe, including Germany and other countries in Central and Eastern 
      Europe. Potential developments in the Ukraine, and the 
      continuation of current sanctions or the imposition of additional 
      sanctions may materially adversely affect the value of the Fund’s 
      portfolio.


This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a 
      solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in 
      any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale 
      would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws 
      of such state or jurisdiction.


Certain statements contained in this release may be forward-looking 
      in nature. These include all statements relating to plans, 
      expectations, and other statements that are not historical facts 
      and typically use words like “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” 
      “intend,” and similar expressions. Such statements represent 
      management’s current beliefs, based upon information available at the
time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed.
All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such 
      statements. Management does not undertake any obligation to 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a 
      result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

CEE and EEA Announce Adjournment of their Annual Meetings of 
      Stockholders with respect to Certain Proposals






June 27, 2017 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. (NYSE:CEE), The 
      European Equity Fund, Inc. (NYSE:EEA), and The New Germany Fund, Inc. 
      (NYSE:GF) (each, a “Fund,” and, collectively, the “Funds”) announced 
      today the results of their Joint Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on 
      June 27, 2017; CEE announced today the adjournment of its Annual 
      Meeting of Stockholders to July 25, 2017 with respect to two proposals; 
      and EEA announced today the adjournment of its Annual Meeting of 
      Stockholders to June 30, 2017 with respect to one proposal.
    

      With respect to CEE, each of the three Class II Directors nominated by 
      the Board of Directors, Ambassador Richard R. Burt, Mr. Walter C. 
      Dostmann and Dr. Kenneth C. Froewiss was elected to serve for a term of 
      three years and until his respective successor is elected and qualifies. 
      One CEE Class I Director nominated by the Board of Directors, Dr. 
      Christopher Pleister, was elected to serve a term of two years and until 
      his successor is elected and qualifies. One CEE Class III Director 
      nominated by the Board of Directors, Dr. Wolfgang Leoni, was elected to 
      serve a term of one year and until his successor is elected and 
      qualifies.
    

      CEE did not receive sufficient votes to approve the proposals (i) to 
      change the Fund’s investment objective from seeking “long-term capital 
      appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked 
      securities of issuers domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey” to 
      seeking “long-term capital appreciation through investment primarily in 
      equity and equity-linked securities of issuers domiciled in Central and 
      Eastern Europe;” and to change the Fund’s corresponding fundamental 
      investment policy to provide that, “[u]nder normal circumstances, the 
      Fund will invest at least 80% of the Fund’s net assets (plus borrowings 
      used for investment purposes) in securities of issuers domiciled in 
      Central and Eastern Europe;” and (ii) to change the Fund’s fundamental 
      investment policies to require the Fund to invest more than 25% of its 
      total assets in the securities of issuers in the energy sector 
      Therefore, the meeting was adjourned to Tuesday, July 25, 2017 at 11.30

      appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked 
      securities of issuers domiciled in countries that are members of the

      domiciled in countries in Europe;” and a change in the Fund’s 
      corresponding fundamental investment policy to provide that, “[u]nder

      securities of issuers domiciled in countries in Europe.” Therefore, the

Important Information


The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. is a 
      non-diversified, closed-end investment company seeking long term capital 
      appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked 
      securities of issuers domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey. 
      Because the Fund is non-diversified, it can take larger positions in 
      fewer issuers than a diversified fund, increasing its potential risk.


The European Equity Fund, Inc. is a diversified, closed-end 
      investment company seeking long-term capital appreciation through 
      investment primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of issuers 
      domiciled in countries that are members of the European Union.


The New Germany Fund, Inc. is a diversified, closed-end investment 
      company seeking capital appreciation primarily through investment in 
      equity or equity-linked securities of small and mid-cap German companies.
The Fund may invest up to 35% of its assets in large cap German 
      companies and up to 20% in non-German companies (with no more than 15% 
      in any single country).


Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging 
      markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, 
      political and economic changes, and market risks. Any fund that 
      concentrates in a particular segment of the market or a particular 
      region will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more 
      broadly.


The shares of most closed-end funds, including the Funds, are not 
      continuously offered. Once issued, shares of closed-end funds are 
      bought and sold in the open market through a stock exchange. Shares 
      of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. 
      The price of a fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, 
      several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, a 
      fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below, or above 
      net asset value.


Investments in funds involve risk. Additional risks of the Fund are 
      associated with international investing, such as currency fluctuations, 
      political and economic changes, market risks, government regulations and 
      differences in liquidity, which may increase the volatility of your 
      investment. Foreign security markets generally exhibit greater 
      price volatility and are less liquid than the US market. Additionally, 
      the Fund focuses its investments in certain geographical regions, 
      thereby increasing their vulnerability to developments in those regions 
      and potentially subjecting the Funds’ shares to greater price volatility.
Some funds have more risk than others. These include funds, 
      such as the Funds, that allow exposure to or otherwise concentrate 
      investments in certain sectors, geographic regions, security types, 
      market capitalization, or foreign securities (e.g., political or 
      economic instability, which can be accentuated in emerging market 
      countries).


The European Union, the United States and other countries have 
      imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of the Russian military 
      intervention in the Ukraine. These sanctions have adversely 
      affected Russian individuals, Russian issuers and the Russian economy. 
      Russia, in turn, has imposed sanctions targeting Western individuals, 
      businesses and products, including food products. The various 
      sanctions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, 
      not only the Russian economy, but also the economies of many countries 
      in Europe, including Germany and other countries in Central Europe. Potential 
      developments in the Ukraine, and the continuation of current sanctions, 
      or the imposition of additional sanctions, may materially adversely 
      affect the value of the Funds’ portfolios.


This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a 
      solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in 
      any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale 
      would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws 
      of such state or jurisdiction.


Certain statements contained in this release may be forward-looking 
      in nature. These include all statements relating to plans, 
      expectations, and other statements that are not historical facts 
      and typically use words like “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” 
      “intend,” and similar expressions. Such statements represent 
      management’s current beliefs, based upon information available at the
time the statements are made, with regard to the matters addressed.
All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those expressed in, or implied by, such 
      statements. Management does not undertake any obligation to 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a 
      result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

Announces Results of Annual Meeting of StockholdersBusiness WireJuly 25, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. (CEE) (the “Fund”) announced today the results of its Joint Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which was initially called to order and adjourned on June 27, 2017 and reconvened on July 25, 2017.Stockholders approved the proposed (i) change to the Fund’s investment objective from seeking “long-term capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of issuers domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey” to seeking “long-term capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity and equity-linked securities of issuers domiciled in Central and Eastern Europe;” (ii) change to the Fund’s corresponding fundamental investment policy to provide that, “[u]nder normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of the Fund’s net assets (plus borrowings used for investment purposes) in securities of issuers domiciled in Central and Eastern Europe;” and (iii) change to the Fund’s fundamental investment policies to require the Fund to invest more than 25% of its total assets in the securities of issuers in the energy sector. The changes to the Fund’s investment objective and fundamental investment policies will be implemented effective August 1, 2017. Effective the close of business on July 31, 2017, the Fund’s benchmark will be changed to the MSCI Emerging Markets Eastern Europe Index and the Fund’s name will be changed to “The Central and Eastern Europe Fund, Inc.” There will be no changes to the Fund’s ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange or the CUSIP number for its shares. The Fund previously announced that, prior to the adjournment of the meeting on June 27, 2017, stockholders elected four Directors and approved the appointment of independent auditors.Important InformationThe Central Europe, Russia and Turkey Fund, Inc. is a non-diversified, closed-end investment company seeking long term capital appreciation through investment primarily in equity or equity-linked securities of issuers domiciled in Central Europe, Russia and Turkey. Because the Fund is non-diversified, it can take larger positions in fewer issuers than a diversified fund, increasing its potential risk.Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. Any fund that concentrates in a particular segment of the market or in a particular geographical region will generally be more volatile than a fund that invests more broadly.The shares of most closed-end funds, including the Fund, are not continuously offered. Once issued, shares of closed-end funds are bought and sold in the open market. Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of a fund’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of the fund. Therefore, a fund cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value.Investments in funds involve risk. Additional risks of the Fund are associated with international investing, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, market risks, government regulations and differences in liquidity, which may increase the volatility of your investment. Foreign security markets generally exhibit greater price volatility and are less liquid than the US market. Additionally, the Fund focuses its investments in certain geographical regions, thereby increasing its vulnerability to developments in those regions and potentially subjecting the Fund’s shares to greater price volatility. Some funds have more risk than others. These include funds, such as the Fund, that allow exposure to or otherwise concentrate investments in certain sectors, geographic regions, security types, market capitalization or foreign securities (e.g., political or economic instability, which can be accentuated in emerging market countries).The European Union, the United States and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of the Russian military intervention in the Ukraine. These sanctions have adversely affected Russian individuals, Russian issuers and the Russian economy. Russia, in turn, has imposed sanctions targeting Western individuals, businesses and products, including food products. The various sanctions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, not only the Russian economy, but also the economies of many countries in Europe, including Germany and other countries in Central and Eastern Europe. Potential developments in the Ukraine, and the continuation of current sanctions or the imposition of additional sanctions may materially adversely affect the value of the Fund’s portfolio.Read MoreThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction.Certain statements contained in this release may be forward-looking in nature.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MVIS Russia Index (MVRSXTR) is a rules-based index, intended to represent the overall performance of publically traded companies that are domiciled and primarily listed on an exchange in Russia or that are not Russian companies, but nonetheless generate at least 50% of their revenues in Russia. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MVIS Russia Index (MVRSXTR) is a rules-based index, intended to represent the overall performance of publically traded companies that are domiciled and primarily listed on an exchange in Russia or that are not Russian companies, but nonetheless generate at least 50% of their revenues in Russia. One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
