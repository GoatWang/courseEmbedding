A leading wealth manager with strong investment banking capabilities.





Our strategy builds on Credit Suisse's core strengths: its position as a leading wealth manager, its specialist investment banking capabilities and its strong presence in our home market of Switzerland. We seek to follow a balanced approach to wealth management, aiming to capitalize on both the large pool of wealth within mature markets as well as the significant growth in wealth in Asia Pacific and other emerging markets, while also serving key developed markets with an emphasis on Switzerland.
Founded in 1856, we today have a global reach with operations in about 50 countries and 47,170 employees from over 150 different nations. Our broad footprint helps us to generate a geographically balanced stream of revenues and net new assets and allows us to capture growth opportunities around the world. We serve our clients through three regionally focused divisions: Swiss Universal Bank, International Wealth Management and Asia Pacific. These regional businesses are supported by two other divisions specializing in investment banking capabilities: Global Markets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets.
The Strategic Resolution Unit consolidates the remaining portfolios from the former non-strategic units plus additional businesses and positions that do not fit with our strategic direction. Our business divisions cooperate closely to provide holistic financial solutions, including innovative products and specially tailored advice.

Our History
Credit Suisse's history stretches back to July 5, 1856 when the prominent politician, business leader and pioneer Alfred Escher founded "Schweizerische Kreditanstalt." The original purpose of the new bank known as SKA was to finance the expansion of the railroad network as well as the further industrialization of Switzerland. Fourteen years later, the bank's first foreign representative office opened up in New York. In 1905, the bank's first branch outside Zurich opened in Basel following the acquisition of Oberrheinische Bank.












Alfred Escher
founder of the "Schweizerische Kreditanstalt" (SKA), the forerunner of Credit Suisse 






What started off as a Swiss investment bank turned into a success story spanning over the next century and a half, with Credit Suisse gradually evolving into a leading global provider of financial services.
This development has been achieved through strong organic growth, supplemented by a series of significant mergers and acquisitions such as that of the US investment bank CS First Boston in 1990, the Swiss private bank Bank Leu in 1990, Switzerland's fourth largest bank – Volksbank – in 1993, the Brazilian wealth manager Hedging-Griffo in 2007, Morgan Stanley's wealth management businesses in Europe, Middle East and Africa in 2013 to cite a couple of more recent deals.
This has involved the amalgamation of very different cultures, philosophies and spheres of specialist knowledge which has resulted in the creation of a strong integrated bank. As of 2006, the bank began operating as a globally active integrated universal bank providing comprehensive solutions to our clients in private banking, investment banking and asset management.

You may now be aware that in October 2015 Credit Suisse announced an exclusive recruiting arrangement with Wells Fargo to provide Relationship Managers and their clients in Credit Suisse’s U.S. Domestic Private Banking business an opportunity to transition to Wells Fargo’s brokerage business, Wells Fargo Advisors, by early 2016.
For our US LatAm Private Banking business Credit Suisse agreed a transition of the LatAm US Relationship Managers, their clients, and certain other employees to Morgan Stanley Wealth Management also in the early half of 2016.
In conjunction with the foregoing, Credit Suisse has decided to exit the Private Banking business in the U.S. by March 31, 2016. After this date, Credit Suisse will no longer offer private banking or wealth management services and will wind-down all current product offerings and client relationships. That also means that after March 31, Credit Suisse will no longer offer investment advisory services. We will continue to be staffed to facilitate the transfer of your accounts or liquidation of securities.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

A loan with an mortgage rate that changes periodically, according to an "index", such as Treasury Bills or the LIBOR index. Monthly payments can go up or down when the mortgage rate is adjusted.
Caps are limits on the amount that the mortgage rate on an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) can change at any one adjustment and (usually) over the life of the loan. They protect the borrower from huge increases in the monthly payment in a rising mortgage rate environment. Rarely, a cap may apply to the payment amount rather than to the rate. Under certain conditions, payment caps can cause the loan balance to increase rather than decrease.
A loose term which generally refers to a fixed-rate conforming loan other than an FHA or VA loan. 
A table which shows the distribution of monthly payments - how much will be applied toward principal and how much toward interest over the life of the loan.
A figure which attempts to reflect the total cost of a loan, expressed as a yearly rate. Because the APR takes the total cost of credit into account, it can never be lower, and is almost higher than the stated note rate or advertised rate. Within reason, the APR allows you to compare different types of mortgages based on the total cost. 

An opinion of the fair value of a property, generally by a qualified and/or licensed professional an appraise. 
The valuation placed on property for the purpose fixing the amount property taxes. 
A fixed rate mortgage with monthly payments which are not large enough to pay off the loan during the term. Balloons end after a specific time, usually one to five years, after which the entire remaining balance must be paid in a lump sum.
1/100th of a point. One point is equal to one percent of the mortgage loan amount; therefore, one basis point equals 1/100 of one percent.  

A mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Typically, FHA mortgages require somewhat lower down payments and less stringent qualification requirements.The borrower pays a relatively high mortgage insurance premium which can be paid monthly or added to the total loan amount.
A mortgage with an mortgage rate that remains constant for the life of the loan. The mortgage rate rate is set when the loan is made and never changes. Also see Balloon Mortgage.
Insurance purchased by the borrower to partially protect the lender against loss if the borrower defaults. Normally required for loans with an LTV greater than 80% (20% down). FHA loans and most first buyer programs require mortgage insurance regardless of the LTV.
Insurance purchased for non-FHA loans is commonly called PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance). Some large lenders self-insure and do not require the buyer to purchase PMI, the interest, however, rate may be slightly higher.Normally, mortgage insurance may be dropped when the LTV drops below 80%. 
A condition where the loan balance goes up, rather than down, as payments are made. If a payment is not large enough to cover the interest due the difference is added to the principal.Negative amortization can occur in certain types of adjustable rate mortgages.
A refinance with the fees and charges are added to the new mortgage amount instead of being paid up front.

A loan with an mortgage rate that changes periodically, according to an "index", such as Treasury Bills or the LIBOR index. Monthly payments can go up or down when the mortgage rate is adjusted.
Caps are limits on the amount that the mortgage rate on an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) can change at any one adjustment and (usually) over the life of the loan. They protect the borrower from huge increases in the monthly payment in a rising mortgage rate environment. Rarely, a cap may apply to the payment amount rather than to the rate. Under certain conditions, payment caps can cause the loan balance to increase rather than decrease.
A loose term which generally refers to a fixed-rate conforming loan other than an FHA or VA loan. 
A table which shows the distribution of monthly payments - how much will be applied toward principal and how much toward interest over the life of the loan.
A figure which attempts to reflect the total cost of a loan, expressed as a yearly rate. Because the APR takes the total cost of credit into account, it can never be lower, and is almost higher than the stated note rate or advertised rate. Within reason, the APR allows you to compare different types of mortgages based on the total cost. 

An opinion of the fair value of a property, generally by a qualified and/or licensed professional an appraise. 
The valuation placed on property for the purpose fixing the amount property taxes. 
A fixed rate mortgage with monthly payments which are not large enough to pay off the loan during the term. Balloons end after a specific time, usually one to five years, after which the entire remaining balance must be paid in a lump sum.
1/100th of a point. One point is equal to one percent of the mortgage loan amount; therefore, one basis point equals 1/100 of one percent.  

A mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Typically, FHA mortgages require somewhat lower down payments and less stringent qualification requirements.The borrower pays a relatively high mortgage insurance premium which can be paid monthly or added to the total loan amount.
A mortgage with an mortgage rate that remains constant for the life of the loan. The mortgage rate rate is set when the loan is made and never changes. Also see Balloon Mortgage.
Insurance purchased by the borrower to partially protect the lender against loss if the borrower defaults. Normally required for loans with an LTV greater than 80% (20% down). FHA loans and most first buyer programs require mortgage insurance regardless of the LTV.
Insurance purchased for non-FHA loans is commonly called PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance). Some large lenders self-insure and do not require the buyer to purchase PMI, the interest, however, rate may be slightly higher.Normally, mortgage insurance may be dropped when the LTV drops below 80%. 
A condition where the loan balance goes up, rather than down, as payments are made. If a payment is not large enough to cover the interest due the difference is added to the principal.Negative amortization can occur in certain types of adjustable rate mortgages.
A refinance with the fees and charges are added to the new mortgage amount instead of being paid up front. 
A mortgage which does not conform to credit or other standards, or to the maximum loan limits set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. See Jumbo Loan.
A fee charged by a lender to cover certain expenses associated with the loan origination. Usually stated as a percentage of the face value of the loan (points).RefiAdvisor does not recommend paying more than one percent for loan originaiton.  It is possible to find credit unions that charge as little as $400 for the originaiton fee.
A point is equal to one percent of the mortgage amount.One point on a $100,000 mortgage would be $1,000, for example. Discount points are simply interest that is paid up-front.Most lenders offer loans with several combinations of points and mortgage rates; generally, more points means a lower mortgage rate, less points means a higher rate.

A residential mortgage made to an eligible military veteran. The loan is guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs to protect the lender against loss in the event of default.

A loan with an mortgage rate that changes periodically, according to an "index", such as Treasury Bills or the LIBOR index. Monthly payments can go up or down when the mortgage rate is adjusted.
Caps are limits on the amount that the mortgage rate on an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) can change at any one adjustment and (usually) over the life of the loan. They protect the borrower from huge increases in the monthly payment in a rising mortgage rate environment. Rarely, a cap may apply to the payment amount rather than to the rate. Under certain conditions, payment caps can cause the loan balance to increase rather than decrease.
A loose term which generally refers to a fixed-rate conforming loan other than an FHA or VA loan. 
A table which shows the distribution of monthly payments - how much will be applied toward principal and how much toward interest over the life of the loan.
A figure which attempts to reflect the total cost of a loan, expressed as a yearly rate. Because the APR takes the total cost of credit into account, it can never be lower, and is almost higher than the stated note rate or advertised rate. Within reason, the APR allows you to compare different types of mortgages based on the total cost. 

An opinion of the fair value of a property, generally by a qualified and/or licensed professional an appraise. 
The valuation placed on property for the purpose fixing the amount property taxes. 
A fixed rate mortgage with monthly payments which are not large enough to pay off the loan during the term. Balloons end after a specific time, usually one to five years, after which the entire remaining balance must be paid in a lump sum.
1/100th of a point. One point is equal to one percent of the mortgage loan amount; therefore, one basis point equals 1/100 of one percent.  

A mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Typically, FHA mortgages require somewhat lower down payments and less stringent qualification requirements.The borrower pays a relatively high mortgage insurance premium which can be paid monthly or added to the total loan amount.
A mortgage with an mortgage rate that remains constant for the life of the loan. The mortgage rate rate is set when the loan is made and never changes. Also see Balloon Mortgage.
Insurance purchased by the borrower to partially protect the lender against loss if the borrower defaults. Normally required for loans with an LTV greater than 80% (20% down). FHA loans and most first buyer programs require mortgage insurance regardless of the LTV.
Insurance purchased for non-FHA loans is commonly called PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance). Some large lenders self-insure and do not require the buyer to purchase PMI, the interest, however, rate may be slightly higher.Normally, mortgage insurance may be dropped when the LTV drops below 80%. 
A condition where the loan balance goes up, rather than down, as payments are made. If a payment is not large enough to cover the interest due the difference is added to the principal.Negative amortization can occur in certain types of adjustable rate mortgages.
A refinance with the fees and charges are added to the new mortgage amount instead of being paid up front. 
A mortgage which does not conform to credit or other standards, or to the maximum loan limits set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. See Jumbo Loan.
A fee charged by a lender to cover certain expenses associated with the loan origination. Usually stated as a percentage of the face value of the loan (points).RefiAdvisor does not recommend paying more than one percent for loan originaiton.  It is possible to find credit unions that charge as little as $400 for the originaiton fee.
A point is equal to one percent of the mortgage amount.One point on a $100,000 mortgage would be $1,000, for example. Discount points are simply interest that is paid up-front.Most lenders offer loans with several combinations of points and mortgage rates; generally, more points means a lower mortgage rate, less points means a higher rate.
The process of verifying the documentation and analyzing the risk associated with granting a mortgage. 
A residential mortgage made to an eligible military veteran. The loan is guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs to protect the lender against loss in the event of default.

A loan with an mortgage rate that changes periodically, according to an "index", such as Treasury Bills or the LIBOR index. Monthly payments can go up or down when the mortgage rate is adjusted.
Caps are limits on the amount that the mortgage rate on an Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM) can change at any one adjustment and (usually) over the life of the loan. They protect the borrower from huge increases in the monthly payment in a rising mortgage rate environment. Rarely, a cap may apply to the payment amount rather than to the rate. Under certain conditions, payment caps can cause the loan balance to increase rather than decrease.
A loose term which generally refers to a fixed-rate conforming loan other than an FHA or VA loan. 
A table which shows the distribution of monthly payments - how much will be applied toward principal and how much toward interest over the life of the loan.
A figure which attempts to reflect the total cost of a loan, expressed as a yearly rate. Because the APR takes the total cost of credit into account, it can never be lower, and is almost higher than the stated note rate or advertised rate. Within reason, the APR allows you to compare different types of mortgages based on the total cost. 

An opinion of the fair value of a property, generally by a qualified and/or licensed professional an appraise. 
The valuation placed on property for the purpose fixing the amount property taxes. 
A fixed rate mortgage with monthly payments which are not large enough to pay off the loan during the term. Balloons end after a specific time, usually one to five years, after which the entire remaining balance must be paid in a lump sum.
1/100th of a point. One point is equal to one percent of the mortgage loan amount; therefore, one basis point equals 1/100 of one percent.  

A mortgage insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Typically, FHA mortgages require somewhat lower down payments and less stringent qualification requirements.The borrower pays a relatively high mortgage insurance premium which can be paid monthly or added to the total loan amount.
A mortgage with an mortgage rate that remains constant for the life of the loan. The mortgage rate rate is set when the loan is made and never changes. Also see Balloon Mortgage.
Insurance purchased by the borrower to partially protect the lender against loss if the borrower defaults. Normally required for loans with an LTV greater than 80% (20% down). FHA loans and most first buyer programs require mortgage insurance regardless of the LTV.
Insurance purchased for non-FHA loans is commonly called PMI (Private Mortgage Insurance). Some large lenders self-insure and do not require the buyer to purchase PMI, the interest, however, rate may be slightly higher.Normally, mortgage insurance may be dropped when the LTV drops below 80%. 
A condition where the loan balance goes up, rather than down, as payments are made. If a payment is not large enough to cover the interest due the difference is added to the principal.Negative amortization can occur in certain types of adjustable rate mortgages.
A refinance with the fees and charges are added to the new mortgage amount instead of being paid up front. 
A mortgage which does not conform to credit or other standards, or to the maximum loan limits set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. See Jumbo Loan.
A fee charged by a lender to cover certain expenses associated with the loan origination. Usually stated as a percentage of the face value of the loan (points).RefiAdvisor does not recommend paying more than one percent for loan originaiton.  It is possible to find credit unions that charge as little as $400 for the originaiton fee.
A point is equal to one percent of the mortgage amount.One point on a $100,000 mortgage would be $1,000, for example. Discount points are simply interest that is paid up-front.Most lenders offer loans with several combinations of points and mortgage rates; generally, more points means a lower mortgage rate, less points means a higher rate.
The process of verifying the documentation and analyzing the risk associated with granting a mortgage. 
A residential mortgage made to an eligible military veteran. The loan is guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs to protect the lender against loss in the event of default.
