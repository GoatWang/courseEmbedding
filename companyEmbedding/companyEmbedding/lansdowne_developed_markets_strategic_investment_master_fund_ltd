FUND ANNOUNCEMENT












For Immediate Release


                                             5 December 2012












Lansdowne UK Strategic Investment Fund Limited (the "Fund")
Lansdowne UK Strategic Investment Master Fund Limited (the "Master Fund")









Re: Change of Name and Change to Investment objective approach and restrictions 




 
Change of Name 
 
The Board of Directors of the Fund wishes to announce that, as previously agreed at an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company on 20 August 2012 and with effect from 1 December 2012, the Fund changed its name from Lansdowne UK Strategic Investment Fund Limited to Lansdowne Developed Markets Strategic Investment Fund Limited. 
The Board of Directors of the Fund also wishes to announce that the memorandum and articles of association of the Fund have been replaced with effect from 1 December 2012 to reflect the change of name. 
With effect from 1 December 2012, the Master Fund has also changed its name from Lansdowne UK Strategic Investment Master Fund Limited to Lansdowne Developed Markets Strategic Investment Master Fund Limited.
 
Change to Investment objective, approach, and restrictions
The Board of Directors of the Fund also wishes to announce that, save as specified below, the Master Fund's investment objective, approach and restrictions are.
"The Master Fund aims to invest primarily in companies in developed markets through equity and equity-related securities which are identified as being mispriced, either in absolute terms or relative to other companies in developed markets. The Master Fund's investment in companies in non-developed markets will normally be no greater than 10 per cent of gross equity exposure."
Change to the Performance Fee
The Board of Directors of the Fund also wishes to announce that with effect from 1 December 2012, class N Shares and class R Shares in the Fund were renamed as "Absolute class N Shares" and "Absolute class R Shares" (together, the "Absolute Shares").
With effect from 1 December 2012, Absolute Shares will be charged a reduced performance fee equal to 7.5 per cent of the excess of the net asset value per Absolute Share of that series of the class at the end of the relevant calculation period over the net asset value per Absolute Share of the same series of the class at the start of that calculation period.
The Board of Directors of the Fund also wishes to announce that with effect from 1 December 2012, the Fund will offer for issue new classes of ordinary shares to be known as "Relative class N Shares" and "Relative class R Shares" (together, the "Relative Shares"). The Relative Shares will be the same as the Absolute Shares in all terms save for the performance fee charged. The performance fee in respect of the Relative Shares will be calculated and will be deemed to accrue on a monthly cumulative basis as at the last Valuation Day in each month and will be calculated with reference to a "Hurdle Amount". The Hurdle Amount will be calculated by reference to the percentage change in value of the S&P500 Total Return Index, whether positive or negative. The performance fee in respect of Relative Shares will be charged at 15 per cent of out-performance of the Hurdle Amount.
