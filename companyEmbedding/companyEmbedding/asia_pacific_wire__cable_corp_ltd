The Company’s present intention is to maintain majority ownership of the voting securities of Charoong Thai.  The board of directors of Charoong Thai may authorize the issuance of additional shares of common stock of Charoong Thai.  The Company has preemptive rights to purchase its pro rata share of any additional authorized shares, less amounts reserved for directors, officers and employees.  In the event the board of Charoong Thai decides to cause it to issue additional shares, the Company may decide not to exercise its preemptive rights, in which case the Company’s interest may be diluted.  In May 2013, rather than producing premium products, a new subsidiary – named “DD” was formed by Charoong Thai in order to produce cable products that were just on par with, or exceeded, national standards.
  Siam Pacific was established in 1988 as a joint venture between PEWC and Italian-Thai Development Plc (“Ital-Thai”), a third party, which at the time was the largest diversified construction company in Thailand, principally engaging in the design, engineering, construction and project management of large-scale civil engineering and telecommunications projects in Thailand.  Capitalizing on PEWC’s wire and cable manufacturing expertise and Ital-Thai’s significant presence in the local market, Siam Pacific was able to establish its presence in this market and gain knowledge of business opportunities in Thailand.  Siam Pacific is now a 100%-owned subsidiary of Charoong Thai and it focuses on the manufacture of telecommunications cable, and enameled wire for the domestic Thailand market.  As we have reported previously, the Siam Pacific operation suffered significant flooding damage in September and October of 2011 but with support from affiliated companies in Taiwan and in China, Siam Pacific resumed full operations during the course of 2012.  During 2013 and 2014, Siam Pacific conducted its operations without any material disruptions.
  Based on information published by the Thai Ministry of Commerce on sales by dollar value, the Company believes that Siam Pacific and Charoong Thai are two of the leading telecommunications and power cable and wire manufacturers in Thailand and are two of a very limited number of the government-approved suppliers of telecommunications cables for major public telecommunications projects in Thailand.

 
North Asia Region
During 2014, the Company’s China (and North Asia) operations were conducted through six business entities – Shanghai Yayang, CCH HK, PEWS, Ningbo, SPRC (equity investee) and PEWC Hong Kong.  The operating entities include Shanghai Yayang, formerly known as Shanghai Pacific Electric Co., Ltd., a subsidiary in Shanghai incorporated in June 1998 to manufacture enameled wires.  The Company’s effective holding in Shanghai Yayang is 66.35%.  Shanghai Yayang manufactures enameled wires with a diameter between 0.05mm and 2.5mm for sale and distribution in the eastern part of China, including to local and Taiwanese based end-users.  The board consist of six directors, each of whom is either a member of management of Shanghai Yayang who are expatriated from Taiwan or Thai representatives, also expatriated or designated by APWC or PEWC.
              The Company owns 100% of CCH HK, a Hong Kong registered company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary company, PEWS.  PEWS manufactures enameled wires for electric, video and audio products primarily for export and with a small portion sold domestically. 
              A new subsidiary - PEWC Hong Kong was created by CCH in August 2013 for the purpose of becoming the trading arm for PEWS, replacing Epan Industries Pte Ltd. (“Epan”) in Singapore, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of APWC, which originally acted as the distributor for PEWS products.  The Company believes that PEWS is one of the major manufacturers of enameled wire products in the southern Chinese market.  In August 2014, PEWC Hong Kong was sold to Dragon Conqueror Ltd., which is a subsidiary of PEWC. The Company received $0.2 million in sale proceeds and realized a loss of $0.2 million from the sale of PEWC Hong Kong. The sale benefited the Company because it was not in a position to continue to support PEWC Hong Kong. As a subsidiary of PEWC, PEWC Hong Kong can call on the resources of PEWC and it continues to act as the distributor of PEWS products.
              In January 2014, Epan was sold to Sigma Cable Company (Private) Limited (“Sigma Cable”), an indirect, 98.3%-owned subsidiary of the Company in Singapore.  Currently, Epan is acting as the distributor of Sigma Cable and other third party suppliers.
              Throughout 2013 and 2014, the Company engaged in the development of new, and the refurbishment of existing, manufacturing facilities and operations located in Ningbo, China.  After ceasing operations at Ningbo in 2006, the Company maintained its interests in land and certain plant and equipment located at the Ningbo site.  APWC also bought out the interest from its partner and now owns 100% of the property, plant and equipment at Ningbo.
              The Company holds a 25.0% interest in SPRC, which manufactures rubber cable for the China market.  The remaining 75% is owned by Shandong Yanggu Wire & Cable Corp. Ltd. (“Shandong Yanggu”), an established cable manufacturer in Shandong Province that produces a wide range of cable products and is considered one of the major cable producers in China.
              The Company held a 49% interest in Shandong Huayu Pacific Fiber Optics Communication, Co., Ltd., which engages in the manufacture of optic fibers.  In January 2013, the Company completed the sale of its 49% interest in SHP to its partner, Shandong Pacific Fiber Optics Cable Co. Ltd., which acquired 100% of SHP as of the closing of that sale.  Due to a severe downturn in the market for fiber optic cable after the SHP was established, the plant intended to be constructed for manufacturing fiber optic cable was not completed and a production date for commencing operations had not been determined.  The Company received RMB 9.5 million for its 49% interest in SHP, which yielded a gain for the Company of over $0.2 million in 2013.  The management considered disposing of its interest in SHP for some time because this equity investee has been in a loss position for several years and because fiber optic cable in Shandong Province is not an element of the Company’s core business plan.
              


Rest of the World (“ROW”) Region
The Company’s ROW region currently includes its Singapore and Australian operations.
              The Company’s Singapore operations are principally conducted through its 98.3%-owned subsidiary, Sigma Cable.  The Company believes that Sigma Cable is one of the major suppliers of power cable products in Singapore.  Sigma Cable manufactures and sells a range of low voltage power cable products, used mainly in infrastructure projects and commercial and residential developments.  Sigma Cable is the exclusive distributor in Singapore of medium and high voltage wire and cable products manufactured by PEWC.  It is also the distributor for general wire manufactured by a third party supplier.
              Sigma Cable also has project engineering operations in Singapore to supply, deliver and install primarily medium and high voltage cable to power transmission projects.  While the Company currently obtains its supply of medium and high voltage power cable for its SDI operations from PEWC, other suppliers are also available if necessary.  The Company anticipates that there will be modest demand for medium and high voltage power cable projects sponsored by the Singapore government in the fairly near future.
              



              The Company’s business in Australia is conducted by Australia Pacific Electric Cable Pty. Ltd. (“APEC”).  The Company went through group restructurings in March 2010 and in June 2012. CCH HK, in total, acquired 64.79% of the shares of APEC from Sigma Cable.  The Company’s effective interest in APEC is now 99.4%.  APEC is located near Brisbane and is one of three major wire and cable manufacturers in Australia.  APEC produces a range of power cables supplemented by imports from overseas sister companies.  APEC possesses a substantial marketing and distribution infrastructure with a network of sales offices and warehouses in the major cities of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
Asia Pacific Wire & Cable Corp Ltd's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Dec. 2016 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=79.472/109.944*91


=65.96



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, Asia Pacific Wire & Cable Corp Ltd's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
Asia Pacific Wire & Cable Corp Ltd's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Dec. 2016 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=48.418-157.646+0.75 * 79.472+0.5 * 77.407


=-10.9



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

(1)The calculation of the earnings per share is based on 13,819,669 and 13,819,669 basic and diluted weighted common shares issued and outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively.


First Three Months 2017 Results 
Gross revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017, were $87.9 million, an increase of 11.8% from $78.7 million in the prior year.  The increase was primarily attributable to a 36.1% revenue increase in the Thailand region due to higher demand in the public sectors and export sales. Revenues in the Company's North Asia region increased by 7.5%, primarily due to the increase in the price of copper.  Revenues in the Company's Rest of World region dropped by 9.7% due to increased market competition. The Company's North Asia region includes China and Hong Kong; the Thailand region contains the operations and sales inside Thailand; the ROW region includes Singapore, Australia and the other markets where APWC has operations or sales outside of the Thailand region and North Asia region.
The gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2017, increased by 16.9% to $7.1 million from $6.1 million in the same period last year. Gross margin was up by 4.6%, growing from 7.8% in 2016 to 8.1% this year.  In the Thailand region, gross margin grew following an increase in our product sales to high margin government projects.  In the North Asia and Rest of World regions, gross margins remained the same.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 were $5.9 million, compared to $5.9 million reported in 2016.  Operating income was $6.1 million, compared to operating income of $0.3 million in 2016.
Net income attributable to APWC shareholders was $4.8 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $0.3 million in 2016.  The increase in net income was due, in part, to the disposal of land use rights and buildings of Ningbo Pacific Cable Co. Ltd. (NPC). Net income per share was $0.35 in the first quarter of 2017, while net income per share was $0.02 in 2016.  The weighted average number of shares issued and outstanding was 13.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.
Financial Condition
APWC reported $56.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $48.2 million as of December 31, 2016.
Current assets totaled $264.2 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to $244.6 million as of December 31, 2016.  Working capital was $170.1 million as of March 31, 2016.  Short term bank loans were $37.2 million at March 31, 2017, an increase from $28.2 million at the end of 2016.  The Company had no long-term debt outstanding at March 31, 2017.  Shareholder's equity attributable to APWC was $210.1 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to $197.2 million as of December 31, 2016.
APWC reported $9.2 million in cash outflows from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to cash generated from operations of $1.5 million in the corresponding period in 2016. Cash used in operations was mainly caused by an increase of inventory. The Company generated $7.6 million from investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $1.1 million cash outflows in the same period of 2016. The cash generated was attributable, in part, to the disposal of land use rights and buildings of NPC.  APWC generated $8.0 million from financing activities during the first quarter of 2017, compared to $3.1 million in outflows in the same period of 2016. The cash generated was mainly attributable to the increase in bank loans.
We encourage shareholders to visit the Company's website for further information (www.apwcc.com). Information on the Company's website or any other website does not constitute a portion of this release.

TAIPEI, Taiwan, June  21, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Asia Pacific Wire & Cable Corporation Limited (NASDAQ:APWC) ("APWC" or the "Company"), a leading manufacturer of wire and cable products for the telecommunications and electric-power industries in the Asia-Pacific region, today announced the Company's financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Unless otherwise indicated, all data are reported in US dollars at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the event or result reported. First Three Months 2017 Financial Results (Ended March 31, 2017)  First 3 Months 2017First 3 Months 2016CHANGERevenues$87.9 million$78.7 million11.8%Gross Profit$7.1 million$6.1 million16.9%Net Income$4.8 million$0.3 million1321.4%EPS(1)$0.35$0.021650.0% (1)The calculation of the earnings per share is based on 13,819,669 and 13,819,669 basic and diluted weighted common shares issued and outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. First Three Months 2017 Results  Gross revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2017, were $87.9 million, an increase of 11.8% from $78.7 million in the prior year.  The increase was primarily attributable to a 36.1% revenue increase in the Thailand region due to higher demand in the public sectors and export sales. Revenues in the Company’s North Asia region increased by 7.5%, primarily due to the increase in the price of copper.  Revenues in the Company’s Rest of World region dropped by 9.7% due to increased market competition. The Company’s North Asia region includes China and Hong Kong; the Thailand region contains the operations and sales inside Thailand; the ROW region includes Singapore, Australia and the other markets where APWC has operations or sales outside of the Thailand region and North Asia region. The gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2017, increased by 16.9% to $7.1 million from $6.1 million in the same period last year. Gross margin was up by 4.6%, growing from 7.8% in 2016 to 8.1% this year.  In the Thailand region, gross margin grew following an increase in our product sales to high margin government projects.  In the North Asia and Rest of World regions, gross margins remained the same. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 were $5.9 million, compared to $5.9 million reported in 2016.  Operating income was $6.1 million, compared to operating income of $0.3 million in 2016. Net income attributable to APWC shareholders was $4.8 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $0.3 million in 2016.  The increase in net income was due, in part, to the disposal of land use rights and buildings of Ningbo Pacific Cable Co. Ltd. (NPC). Net income per share was $0.35 in the first quarter of 2017, while net income per share was $0.02 in 2016.  The weighted average number of shares issued and outstanding was 13.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Financial Condition APWC reported $56.8 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2017, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $48.2 million as of December 31, 2016. Current assets totaled $264.2 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to $244.6 million as of December 31, 2016.  Working capital was $170.1 million as of March 31, 2016.  Short term bank loans were $37.2 million at March 31, 2017, an increase from $28.2 million at the end of 2016.  The Company had no long-term debt outstanding at March 31, 2017.  Shareholder's equity attributable to APWC was $210.1 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to $197.2 million as of December 31, 2016. APWC reported $9.2 million in cash outflows from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to cash generated from operations of $1.5 million in the corresponding period in 2016. Cash used in operations was mainly caused by an increase of inventory. The Company generated $7.6 million from investing activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $1.1 million cash outflows in the same period of 2016. The cash generated was attributable, in part, to the disposal of land use rights and buildings of NPC.  APWC generated $8.0 million from financing activities during the first quarter of 2017, compared to $3.1 million in outflows in the same period of 2016. The cash generated was mainly attributable to the increase in bank loans. We encourage shareholders to visit the Company’s website for further information (www.apwcc.com).
