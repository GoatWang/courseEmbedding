Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Ipsy.com.  5 beauty product for $10 shipping included.  I am not delusional brotha i am just saying.  First we dont really know what we are getting in this box.  All i said is i think they could of worked the box dollar down some to focus on the demographic they are going to be going after.  I am 100% DMac.  $26 a month is steep imo.  I am hoping they come with legit stuff each month.

Red Giant Entertainment Announces Major Restructuring Plans for 2017
 Orlando, FL,  March 03, 2017 --(PR.com)-- Red Giant Entertainment Inc. (REDG), an innovative Intellectual Property company specializing in high quality characters and content for use in a variety of media and entertainment, announced a series of plans to overhaul and revitalize their business.“We are retrenching,” Benny Powell, Red Giant CEO stated. “We have been plagued by several issues, and spent the past several months analyzing solutions and developing a plan to move forward, change directions, and make major adjustments. This isn’t simply a band-aid but, rather, a complete overhaul from top to bottom. These actions began with our recent 14c filing, which is just one in a series of cogs needed to become a profitable, revenue-producing company – which we believe we can achieve.”This top-down plan begins with Red Giant Entertainment, Inc. seeking new leadership, including key positions managing the various product lines and ultimately new CEO and CFO positions. Until the new CEO is found, Powell will continue to act in the roles he currently holds and will help ease new leadership in place during this transition. This new leadership will extend to the revenue-generating product platforms they have, as well.Powell further explained, “We want what is best for the company, and that requires delegating to qualified leadership who can also bring new creativity and vision. Frankly, it was always the plan to hand the reins over. It’s an exciting moment for expansion. We’ve learned from what went wrong and taken the past several months to build things correctly from the ground, up. That cannot be done on a shoestring and a prayer, the way we had been. Nor can it be done with the limited personnel and management. It takes people and money to grow this business, and that is what we will do.”Red Giant is also putting in place a series of financing moves designed to clean up its debt, restart the product lines currently on hold, increase its marketing and expand its reach in new directions.Additionally, the company has pledged to focus its attention primarily on revenue-producing sectors to become self-sustaining and build profitability. These plans will be further explained in the days ahead.“We have identified several key areas that we plan to expand into,” explained Powell. “We are an intellectual property development company, and while we continue to broaden that vertically, it is through innovative platforms such as POWFOLIO that we will expand our reach horizontally as well. At the end of the day, what matters is that we focus on generating revenue in a clear and consistent manner fully staffed with the infrastructure to support proper, methodical growth. The changes are necessary for this and it is how we affect our bottom line.”Red Giant provides news and updates at the following online locations:http://redgiantentertainment.com and on https://www.facebook.com/RedGiantEntertainmentAbout Red Giant Entertainment Inc.Red Giant Entertainment Inc. (OTC: REDG) is a Florida corporation that specializes in intellectual property (IP) development for multiple media platforms and transmedia propagation.

So here are the rules:



*  Unless we specifically ask you to snail-mail something to us -- a printed book, a flash drive, bribes -- submit your work to us at submissions@redgiantentertainment.com.  We're well into the 21st Century, and our creators around the world send files digitally.  So there's no need to worry about shipping us samples by snail mail, UPS, Fed Ex, carrier pigeon, or strapped to the back of a camel.



*  When submitting .jpgs by Email, LABEL YOUR FILES PROPERLY.  This means putting your NAME, the SERIES you're submitting, the TYPE OF WORK (art, color, lettering) you're submitting, whether the work is published or just a sample, and WHAT PAGE NUMBER in the sequence you're submitting.  If you submit something like art1.jpg, that tells us you don't care about your work enough to identify yourself or anything about it, so we're not going to care, either.  Fair enough?  Label it along the lines of DazoTESLApencilsample1of5.jpg, and we'll all be happy.  If you're submitting a .pdf of your work, then something like NigelSmithArtPortfolio2014.pdf works just fine.  Portfolio.pdf?  Not so much; watch how fast we hit "delete."



*  DO NOT send us links instead of your samples, although it is OK to include links IN ADDITION TO your samples.  We're not interested in checking your deviantart site to see your high school yearbook art or anything else unrelated to your actual submission to us.



*  Include a COVER LETTER.  Your name, your address, your credits if any, what you're submitting, and why.



*  Before you send us anything -- concept or story or art or lettering or covers -- download, fill out, and sign the RED GIANT SUBMISSION FORM.  You'll find it right HERE!


Read it.  Learn it.  Understand it.  Also note that Red Giant does not review any unsolicited story concepts, ideas, proposals, or scripts for properties we already publish, or any property not owned by the person/agent submitting it.  Such material will be tossed/deleted without review. 


DO NOT SEND UNSOLICITED STORY SUBMISSIONS.  They will be deleted.


WRITERS: Please send us an Email outlining your writing accomplishments/experience and why you hope to write for Red Giant Entertainment. If you interest us, we'll let you know and ask you to submit something; even so, if you neglect to include the Red Giant Submission Form mentioned above, we'll delete it unread.  Do not send ideas, proposals, or scripts for books we're already publishing; the creators of those properties have their own ideas, thank you.  If you bombard us with Email or calls to check up on your submission, it will got to the bottom of the pile or get tossed.  If we want to hire you, we'll let you know.


ARTISTS:  Five to 10 pages of sample artwork is plenty. 


PENCILERS:  If you pencil, just send pencils of your sequential pages and maybe, just maybe, a cover or two if you're good enough.  Don't send inks, letters, or colors if you're trying to sell us your pencilling skills.  Most artists shoot from pencils or do work digitally on a Cintiq, anyway.


INKERS:  Submit .jpgs of the pencils you inked as well as the inks, for comparison purposes.  It's best to show inks over more than one professional penciller.  Don't ink amateur samples.


COLORISTS:  Send us sequential samples over PROFESSIONAL artwork, not amateur or semi-professional stuff; such art files are easily found online.  If you're tempted to send us a bunch of pinups?  Don't.  Only 5% of a colorist's actual assignments tend to be covers or pinups, so only 5% of your portfolio should reflect that.


COVER PAINTERS: We welcome traditional and digital painters.  We especially encourage artists who can tell a story with their covers, rather than just show mannequins posing.

 

PLEASE BE AWARE that our job is to find the BEST POSSIBLE PEOPLE to create for us.  If you're GREAT enough, and there's a freelance opportunity you fit into, we may offer you work.  If you get no response, we weren't moved by what you submitted; you are certainly welcome to submit something new.  If we respond with a simple, "Your work is not at the level we're looking for," that's exactly what we mean.  If you're close to what we want and ask for revisions on your samples, we expect to see those revisions made promptly to see how well you work with an editor.



WE ARE NOT HERE TO TEACH YOU.   If you write back asking for more explanations or details of what wasn't good enough, that means you're not developed enough to spot it for yourself -- and we're too busy putting out books with professionals at the helm to spend that time teaching you.  There are books for that.  There are schools for that.  There are agents for that. 


NOTICE:  Submitter acknowledges that Red Giant Entertainment may have independently developed or been informed of ideas or themes similar or identical to those contained in your submission, and we have no obligation to you whatsoever except as may be set forth in a subsequent written agreement between Red Giant Entertainment and submitter.
