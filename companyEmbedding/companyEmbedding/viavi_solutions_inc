InterferenceAdvisor
Fully-automated interference hunting
Watch Video













Radio frequency (RF) interference can cause major quality of experience issues for your customers. Dropped calls, decreased battery life, poor voice quality, and reduced data throughput can all be caused by interference.


Locating an interference source using traditional methods can take days, if not weeks, costing you valuable time, money, and potential customer churn.
At Viavi, we worked with major service providers to come up with a better solution.
InterferenceAdvisorTM is a fully-automated interference hunting solution. Easy to set up and simple to use, it allows one RF engineer to identify and locate an interference source in just hours, simply by following voice prompts on a familiar map-style application on an Android tablet.
Learn more about InterferenceAdvisor at the links below.

Fully-automated interference hunting

Radio frequency (RF) interference can cause major quality of experience issues for your customers. Dropped calls, decreased battery life, poor voice quality, and reduced data throughput can all be caused by interference.


Locating an interference source using traditional methods can take days, if not weeks, costing you valuable time, money, and potential customer churn.
At Viavi, we worked with major service providers to come up with a better solution.
InterferenceAdvisorTM is a fully-automated interference hunting solution. Easy to set up and simple to use, it allows one RF engineer to identify and locate an interference source in just hours, simply by following voice prompts on a familiar map-style application on an Android tablet.
