                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Rates AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2014-2
    





June 12, 2014 12:34 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the 
      notes issued by AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust (AMCAR) 2014-2:
    

      --$227,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$245,000,000 class A-2-A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$208,950,000 class A-2-B notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$313,460,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$107,120,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$132,980,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$130,770,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$34,720,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Credit Quality: The 2014-2 pool displays relatively consistent 
      credit quality versus 2013 pools, with a 566 weighted average (WA) Fair 
      Isaac Corp. (FICO) score, and a 241 WA internal credit score. Extended 
      term contracts continue to account for the majority of the pool at 
      89.46%. New vehicles total 47.82% of the pool, consistent with prior 
      AMCAR transactions.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is 
      consistent with the prior nine transactions. The reserve is 2.00% 
      (nondeclining), and initial overcollateralization (OC) is 5.25%, growing 
      to a target of 14.25% of the outstanding pool balance (less the required 
      reserve amount for the distributing period). Of note, excess spread has 
      decreased to one of the lowest levels seen to date, at 8.88% per annum.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses on GM Financial's 
      managed portfolio and securitizations declined to some of its lowest 
      levels, given the gradual economic recovery and stronger used vehicle 
      values.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates GM and GM Financial Company Inc. 
      'BB+' with a Positive Rating Outlook. The company has recorded positive 
      corporate financial results since 2010. Fitch assessed the potential 
      impact of GM/GM-affiliated brand vehicle recalls in relation to this 
      transaction; Fitch expects this to have limited to no impact on the 
      2014-2 pool.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AFSI demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and 
      securitization performance. Fitch deems AFSI capable of adequately 
      servicing this series.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of GM Financial would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITY
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to each class of 
      AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 2014-2 to increased losses over 
      the life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that each class of 
      notes displays some sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, with 
      some classes showing potential downgrades of up to two rating categories 
      under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. Some classes of 
      notes could experience downgrades of more than three rating categories 
      under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key rating drivers and rating sensitivities are further detailed in the 
      accompanying presale report at 'www.fitchratings.com' 
      or by clicking on the above link.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'AmeriCredit Automobile Receivables Trust 
      2014-2 -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in Fitch's April 17, 2012 special report, 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions'.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
