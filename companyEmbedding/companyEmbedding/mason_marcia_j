Testimonials





 
“I’ve been using Resting in the River’s lotion and body butter for the 8 years or so I’ve lived in NM. Because I have hypothyroid and we live in the desert, I have very dry skin. I work in healthcare so I am washing my hands constantly. I am disabled by chemical sensitivities, so there are very few lotions I can use safely. Your products soak into my skin very nicely! Last night, I used the Intens Salve on my feet so now I’ve found another necessary product. I use your Body Lotion and Body Butter – they are the BEST.”
 
 



Carla S.   -  Albuquerque, NM - Healing Body Butter & Body Wash




 
“I want you all to know how much I appreciate the healing the Body Butter gave my mother and aunt. They have been itching all over for weeks with some unknown dermatitis or bug bites or who knows what. A knowledgeable clerk at Whole Foods in Santa Fe recommended the Body Butter when our family was visiting last week and within the first day of slathering the cream on their skin they both felt much improved. So to keep them feeling great, I have ordered each of them one jar of the Body Butter and one jar of Body Lotion. Blessings!”



Jill - Rohnert Park, CA - Healing Body Butter & Body Lotion






Thank you for visiting our website. BIG NEWS!  The farm sold in January 2014, but the product line is still available and made just the same way because the herbs are still being grown organically in New Mexico!

"The earth truly is the mother of us all. And like a good mother it provides us with everything we need. By working with the earth, the rhythms of the seasons, the phases of the moon, we can learn the lessons that nature longs to teach us and use those teachings to enrich ourselves, our health and ultimately the state of our happiness and well being."-Marsha Mason
