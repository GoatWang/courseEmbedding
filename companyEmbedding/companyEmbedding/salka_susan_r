This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Page Content​​​San DiegoOf all the accolades Susan Salka has received, the one that  epitomizes her leadership is Director of the Year for Corporate Citizenship, a  tribute to this Aztec’s lifelong work toward greater corporate responsibility. As president and CEO of AMN Healthcare, Ms. Salka is  energetic, innovative and forward-thinking; but above all she is an authentic  and exemplary leader. During her tenure, AMN has become a role model for how  public companies can leverage their people and resources to impact local and  global communities. The San Diego-based company has supported The Ronald  McDonald House, Father Joe’s Villages, Make A Wish, HELPS International and  numerous other nonprofits. Ms. Salka joined AMN Healthcare with less than 20 employees  in 1990 as the company’s first Chief Financial Officer. She rose swiftly,  taking on broader responsibilities and over time assuming the roles of Chief  Operating Officer, President and, ultimately, Chief Executive Officer in 2005. Under her leadership AMN Healthcare has evolved to become  the largest and most comprehensive provider and healthcare staffing and  workforce solutions company in the country. It was first in the industry to  exceed $1 billion in revenue and is now approaching the $2-billion mark.  Ms. Salka has guided AMN’s expansion through  the acquisition of more than 20 companies and led the industry into a new era  of technology-enabled services for workforce management.  An NYSE listed company, AMN Healthcare is  frequently recognized for being best-in-class for its ethics, compliance and  corporate governance programs and outcomes. Ms. Salka’s many awards testify to her achievements. The San Diego Business Journal named her  Most Admired CEO of 2016 among large public companies; the Corporate Director’s  Forum honored her in 2014 as Director of the Year for Corporate Citizenship;  and San Diego Magazine chose her as its 2012 Woman of the Year. Ms. Salka maintains strong ties to San Diego State  University and a long history of service to the university. She received a master’s  degree in finance in 1989 and the Monty Award for Distinguished Alumni in 2010.  Formerly a member of the College of Business Administration’s Dean’s Advisory  Board, she currently serves on the Campanile Foundation Executive Committee and  its Audit Committee. In recognition of Susan Salka’s positive leadership,  business prowess and profound contributions to the community, the Board of  Trustees of the California State University and San Diego State University are  proud to confer upon her the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters.
