(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Forward Looking Statements  This report contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements involve  known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "could," "intends," "target," "projects," "contemplates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other similar words. These statements are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We discuss many of the risks in greater detail under the heading "Risk Factors." Also, these forward-looking statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report.  This report also contains estimates and other statistical data made by independent parties and by us relating to market size and growth and other industry data. This data involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. We have not independently verified the statistical and other industry data generated by independent parties and contained in this report. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industries in which we operate are necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.  Plan of Operation  China ShouGuan Mining Corporation ("ShouGuan", "we" and the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 4, 2010. We are a holding company that conducts business operations through BSL, our operating company, and its subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) in Shandong Province in the People's Republic of China ("PRC").  Mr. Feize Zhang, our Chairman and CEO, Mr. JingFengLv, our CTO and Mr. Jianxi Yang, a director of YantaiJinGuan Investment Limited, founded SSIC in December 2008 and later in early 2009 established SSIC's subsidiaries JinGuan and XinGuan. These executive officers and managers are experts in China who specialize in mining technologies, mining resources management and financial and strategic management. Our primary focus is on acquiring existing gold mine projects in Shandong province of the PRC. These potential targets are mostly run with low productivity because of inadequate funds and primitive technologies. We plan to re-engineer and redevelop these gold mines through the transfer of advanced exploration and mining technologies, capital injection and effective management.  These advanced exploration and mining technologies include mining data collection and analysis, identification of ore locations and running trends of veins, design of exploration and mining plans, on-site mine construction planning, formulation and customization of mining methodologies, introduction of modern exploration and mining technologies, supervision of subcontracting staff and provision of technical supports in relation to production management, mine ventilation, water discharge, system upgrade, quality assurance, safety control, etc. The underground mining works,  like digging tunnels and wells and the underground transport of ore extracts will all be outsourced to third party subcontractors.  Our business model includes sourcing of early stage gold mines with good profit potential, conducting feasibility studies to identify suitable projects, leasing the suitable mining sites and facilities, and managing the mineral exploration operations on these selected sites, with the goal of acquiring the mine if the operations prove to be satisfactory, based on the review criteria set by our experienced management. To date, we have leased the Dayuan Mine. So far we do not have any plan to acquire the Dayuan Mine. In near future, we tend to focus our business on the exploratory work of these mines. In addition, we provide consulting services in areas related to mine exploration and geological analysis to our clients.  Under the specific requirements of the SEC's Industry Guide 7(a) 4(i), we are deemed as an exploration company principally engaging in gold mine exploration and exportation activities given our mines are without known reserves. Raw rocks containing gold mineral are dug from the gold mines that are owned or leased by us and are converted to gold concentrate through a number of physical processes.  Revenues are derived from the sales of gold concentrates, the principal raw material used in gold smelting operation to produce gold. At that time, the selling prices are determined from two factors, the amount of gold in the gold concentrates and the price of gold on the date of sale. The amount of gold in the gold concentrates is determined and agreed between the Company and the smelters and then the selling price is determined according to the official gold price at the time of sale as indicated by the Shanghai Gold Exchange (http://www.sge.sh), an entity governed by the PRC Government. In order to minimize the effect of fluctuations of gold price and to achieve better economies of scale in operations, the Company decides to focus more on mine exploration.  On the consulting side, revenues are derived on a project-by-project basis and payment is collected as we complete our services as outlined in the scope of each individual project. In the coming years, we expect there will be more projects on exploratory consulting services.  We target to grow proactively through continual sourcing of existing gold mines in the PRC and managing them. These projects will be executed by BSL and its subsidiaries, VIEs or related companies in China. CunliJi Gold Mine was the first project commenced in May 2009. To ensure all mines are legally and properly operated, all target gold mines are required to have full sets of government-approved licenses before effecting commencement of any business operations.  There is a limited supply of desirable gold mines in the PRC and we face strong competition for gold mining rights from other gold mining companies, most of which have greater financial resources than we have, so we may not be able to acquire any attractive gold mining rights we find on acceptable terms.  Mining rights are amortized based on actual units of production over estimated proven and/ or probable reserves of the mines, subject to impairment. We intend to carefully review the mineral exploration plans and the reserve levels of our mines periodically. Accordingly, any material change in mineral exploration s may have a negative impact on our operating results.  Our mineral exploration activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards typical in the mining industry, including:  � environmental hazards;  � industrial accidents;  � unusual or unexpected geologic formations;  � explosive rock failures; and  � flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions.  Any such risks could result in:  � damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities;  � personal injury or death;  � environmental damage;  � delays in mining;  � monetary losses; and  � legal liability.  In addition, during the course of mineral exploration activities, we use dangerous materials. We have established stringent rules relating to the storage, handling and use of such dangerous materials, however, accidents could still occur. Should we be held liable for any such accident, we may be subject to penalties, and possible criminal proceedings may be brought against our Company, BSL, its subsidiaries and/or VIEs or any of the employees.  We emphasize environmental protection in our operations and related activities, and a significant financial commitment has been made towards the construction of environmental protection facilities and the establishment of a sound environmental protection management and monitoring system. We are currently in compliance with applicable environmental regulations of the PRC government, but any changes to these regulations may increase our operating costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.  We are also subject to numerous PRC rules and regulations governing the mining industry, which are disclosed in detail in the Description of Business section of this report. Our inability to comply with any of these current or future rules and/or regulations could severely impact our operations and financial condition.  In addition, we provide mining management consulting services to third party clients as an additional source of revenue. We only provide mining consulting services to mine owners. We do not own, rent or participate in the mine operations of these clients. Instead, we utilize the described expertise of our management team to help clients assess their mine conditions and provide technical advice, guidance and suggestions to further improve management and operations of their mines, based on our management's experience.  Current Operations  On May 6, 2011, we, through our VIE, YantaiJinguan Investment Co., Ltd. ("Jinguan"), entered into a lease agreement with LongkouDayuan Gold Mining Co. Ltd., an unrelated third party being the legal owner and holding the mining license of the Dayuan Gold Mine ("Dayuan Mine") regarding Dayuan Gold Mine. Under the agreement, we  agreed to pay the aggregate rental payments of approximately $20 million for a term of 10 years commencing from April 1, 2011 through April 1, 2021 to obtain the right to manage and operate Dayuan Gold Mine in the repayment schedule, whereas we are committed to pay an upfront payment of $12 million equal to 6 years' rental, no later than September 30, 2011 and the remainder will be paid no later than March 1, 2017. Concurrently, we entered into an equipment transfer agreement (the "Transfer Agreement") with Longkou Datong Industry and Trade Co., Ltd. for the acquisition of mining assets and auxiliary equipment currently being used in the Dayuan Gold Mine at a purchase price of approximately $2.3 million.  Dayuan Mine  We do not own the Dayuan Mine. We leased the mine through Jinguan. The Dayuan Mine is currently owned by LongkouDayuan Gold Mining Co. Ltd. ("LDGM"). Based on the lease agreement signed by LDGM and Jinguan, LDGM leased the Dayuan Mine to Jinguan for a term of 10 years from April 1, 2011 to April 1, 2021 for a total rental payment of RMB130 million (approximately $20 million). Jinguan was committed to pay an upfront payment of $12 million no later than September 30, 2011 and the remainder will be paid no later than March 1, 2017. Under this agreement, we own the operating right and income right of the Dayuan Mine.  The Dayuan Mine has one exploration right and one mining right, which are granted by the Land and Resources Authority of Shandong Province and are unpatented. The concession period of the mining right is from 29 December 2010 to 29 December 2013. The mine is 0.3475 sq, km in area and is deposited in a lode or vein filled with mineral in the rock.  The Dayuan Mine commenced exploratory operation in July 2011.  Currently we derive our revenue from the sales of non-refined gold concentrates extracted from Dayuan Mine. Our expenses are mainly amortization of mining rights, the direct costs associated with the operation and overhead expenses such as staff salaries, smelting and extracting fee, depreciation of mining plants and other general administrative expenses.  At the moment, we are formulating an exploration plan and related timetable for the Dayuan mine. So far, there is no detailed plan to conduct exploration on the Dayuan Mine. The exploration programs of the mine are currently funded by the internal fund generated from our operations and we have no further plan to fund the exploration programs of the mine.  Results of Operations  We do not believe there have been any recent trends in production, sales, inventory, or the state of the costs or selling prices of our products since the financial year ending 2009, nor any known trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our net sales or revenues, income from continuing operations, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported financial information not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial condition.  The following table set forth key components of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. All numbers referenced are in U.S. Dollars:  Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2015:   Years ended December 31, Increase % Increase 2016 2015 (Decrease) (% Decrease) Revenues, net $ - $ - - - Cost of revenue - Mining operating cost (374,713) (512,076) 137,363 (27%) Mining related depreciation and 2,600,595 -100% amortization - (2,600,595) Total cost of revenue (374,713) (3,112,671) 2,737,958 (88%) Gross loss (374,713) (3,112,671) 2,737,958 (88%) Operating expenses: General and (4,058,401) 740% administrative (4,607,159) (548,758) Total operating (4,058,401) 740% expenses (4,607,159) (548,758) Loss from operations (4,981,872) (3,661,429) (1,320,443) 36% Other income (expense) : Interest income 448 130 318 245% Interest expense (392,294) (262,911) (129,383) 49% Loss before income (1,449,508) 37% taxes (5,373,718) (3,924,210) Income tax expense - - NM NM NET LOSS $ (5,373,718) $ (3,924,210) (1,449,508) 37% Other comprehensive income: - Foreign currency (585,047) (665%) translation gain (497,090) 87,957 COMPREHENSIVE LOSS $ (5,870,808) $ (3,836,253) (2,034,555) 53% Net loss per share- (0.02) 67% Basic and diluted $ (0.05) $ (0.03)  NM: Not meaningful  Net Revenues  We commenced gold mineral exploration activity in May 2009 and began selling of gold concentrate in July 2009. Gold concentrate is mainly sold to smelting plants in the Shandong Province, PRC.  Revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 comprised the following:   Years ended December 31, 2016 % 2015 % Revenues, net $ - $ - Cost of revenue Mining operating cost (374,713) 100% (512,076) 16% Mining related depreciation and amortization - 0% (2,600,595) 84% Total cost of revenue (374,713) 100% (3,112,671) 100% Mining gross loss (374,713) (3,112,671) Gross loss margin NM NM  NM: Not meaningful  There was no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015. We have ceased the operation in the Dayuan mine.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $374,713 and $3,112,671 respectively, and consisted primarily of direct materials, direct labor, extracting fees, other operating overhead, and mining related depreciation and amortization.  Gross Loss  We recorded a mining gross loss of $374,713 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2,737,958 or 88%, from gross loss of $3,112,671 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to the absence of revenue in 2016.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses comprised mainly of impairment charge and salaries and staff welfare expenses, legal and professional fees, entertainment expenses, traveling and hotel accommodation expenses and office expenses. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased by $4,058,401 or 740%, from $548,758 to $4,607,159 for the same comparable period in 2016, due to $3,262,157 impairment loss on property, plant and equipment, prepaid mining rights and account receivable relating to Dayuan mine  Income Tax Expense  There was no income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Net Loss  We recorded a net loss of $5,373,718 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1,449,508 from a net loss of $3,924,210 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net loss was mainly attributable to the increase in general and administrative expenses.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary liquidity needs are to fund operational expenses, capital expenditures and potential acquisition of gold mining properties in the Shandong province. To date, we have financed our working capital requirements and capital expenditures through internally generated cash and capital contribution from our existing shareholders.  As of December 31, 2016, our current assets were $1,365,829 and our current liabilities were $10,866,833. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $68,134 as of December 31, 2016. Stockholders' deficit at December 31, 2016 was $8,516,183.  Net cash used in operating activities was $2,006,116 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $1,994,326 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in operating activities increased by $11,790 was primarily due to the increase in net loss.  Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $3,128 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of $314,972 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $311,844 was primarily due to the absence of payment on leased mining rights in 2016.  Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $1,972,422 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2,240,175 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $267,753, primarily due to the increase in repayments to loans payable.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships.  Statutory Reserve  Under the PRC Law, the Company, BSL and its subsidiaries and variable interest entities in the PRC are required to make appropriation to the statutory reserve based on after-tax net earnings and determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the People's Republic of China (the "PRC GAAP"). Appropriation to the statutory reserve should be at least 10% of the after-tax net income until the reserve is equal to 50% of the registered capital. The statutory reserve is established for the purpose of providing employee facilities and other collective benefits to the employees and is non-distributable other than in liquidation.  For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company contributed $0 and $0 to statutory reserve, respectively.  Commitments and Contingencies  We are committed under several non-cancelable operating leases for office premises with the terms ranging from 1 to 2 years, with fixed monthly rentals or scheduled payments. Total rent expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $133,163 and $103,722, respectively.  As of December 31, 2016, we have the aggregate future minimum rental payments due under various non-cancelable operating leases in the next two years:  Year ending December 31,   2017 110,379 2018 9,198 Total: $ 119,577  Subsequent Events  In accordance with ASC Topic 855, " Subsequent Events ", which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued, we have evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after December 31, 2016 up through the date we issued the audited consolidated financial statements.  A one for four reverse stock split was accepted by FINRA on March 13, 2017.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  The discussion and analysis of the Company's results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures. The assumptions, estimates and judgments included within these estimates are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements were prepared. On a regular basis, the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments are reviewed to ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to: (1) inventory costs and reserves; (2) asset impairments (3) and depreciable lives of assets. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur,  as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. We evaluate and update these assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist us with these evaluations. Actual results could differ from the estimates that have been used.  Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, as they require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Basis of Consolidation  The audited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, BSL and its subsidiaries and VIEs. All inter-company balances and transactions between the Company, BSL and its subsidiaries and VIEs were eliminated upon consolidation. We adopted the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810-10-5-8, "Variable Interest Entities". ASC Topic 810-10-5-8 requires a variable interest entity or VIE to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIEs or is entitled to receive a majority of the VIEs' residual returns.  Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)  The Company, through BSL's subsidiary, SBCL, entered into a series of agreements ("VIE agreements") with SSIC, JinGuan and DYM, and the individual owners of SSIC, JinGuan and DYM (see NOTE below), and details of the VIE agreements are as follows:  1. Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement, - SBCL has the exclusive right to provide to SSIC, JinGuan and DYM consulting services, including operational management, human resources management, research and development of the technologies related to the operations of SSIC, JinGuan and DYM. SSIC, JinGuan and DYM pays to SBCL annually consulting service fees in an amount equal to all of their revenue for such year. These agreements run for a 10-year term and are subject to automatic renewal for an additional 10 years, provided that no objection is made by both parties on the renewal.  2. Exclusive Option Agreement - SBCL has the option to purchase all assets and ownership of SSIC, JinGuan and DYM at any time.  . . .  Apr 18, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  INFORMATION REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential" or "continue," the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this report to conform such statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.  Available Information  Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports that we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available at the SEC's public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the public reference room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC also maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.  Overview  China ShouGuan Investment Holding Group Corporation ("ShouGuan", "we" and the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 4, 2010. We are a holding company that conducts business operations in Shandong Province in the People's Republic of China (PRC). On June 23, 2010, we entered into a stock exchange transaction with the shareholders of Bei Sheng Limited ("BSL"), whereby we issued 100,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the ownership interest in BSL, for the purpose of re-domiciling BSL as a Nevada corporation in the United States. These shares were issued as restricted securities under SEC Rule 144. As a result of the share exchange transaction, BSL became our wholly-owned operating subsidiary in the PRC. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to the Company throughout this annual report include the operations of BSL and its subsidiaries and variable interest entities ("VIEs").  We were founded by a number of business professionals and experts in China who specialize in mining technologies, mining resources management and financial and strategic management. Our primary focus is on acquiring existing gold mine in Shandong province of the PRC. These potential targets are mostly run with low productivity because of inadequate funds and primitive technologies. We plan to re-engineer and redevelop these gold mines through the transfer of advanced exploration and mining technologies, capital injection and effective management.  We provide consulting services in areas related to mine exploration and analysis to our clients on a project-by-project basis.  Revenues are derived on a project-by-project basis and payment is collected as we complete our service as outlined in the scope of each individual project.  We target to grow proactively through continual sourcing of existing gold mines in the PRC and managing them. These projects will be executed by BSL and its VIEs. Cunli Ji Gold Mine was the first project commenced in May 2009. To ensure all mines are legally and properly operated, all target gold mines are required to have full sets of government-approved licenses before effecting commencement of any business operations.  On December 28, 2010, the Company's Form S-1 registration statement (the "Registration Statement") was declared effective by the SEC, allowing us to sell a total of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock and raise a total of $500,000, which we intend to use to implement our business operations (the "Offering"). The Offering was expired on June 26, 2011 as stated in the Registration Statement and the Board of Directors of the Company has held a special meeting and resolved to extend the offering period for an additional 180 days. On October 30, 2011, the Company consummated the sale to 19 accredited investors of an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001, at a per share price of $0.201, or $201,000 in the aggregate, pursuant to certain subscription agreements. These shares were subsequently issued on January 12, 2012. This offering was the initial public offering of common stock of China Shouguan Mining Corporation. The Company is now quoting at OTCQB for the symbol CHSO.  On May 6, 2011, the Company, through its variable interest entity, Yantai Jinguan Investment Co., Ltd. ("Yantai"), entered into a lease agreement with Longkou Dayuan Gold Mining Co. Ltd., an unrelated third party being the legal owner and holding the mining license of the Dayuan gold mine (the "Lease Property") regarding Dayuan Gold Mine. Under the agreement, the Company agrees to pay the aggregate rental payments of approximately $20 million for a term of 10 years commencing from April 1, 2011 through April 1, 2021 to obtain the right to manage and operate the Lease Property in the repayment schedule, whereas the Company is committed to pay $12 million equal to 6 years' rental, no later than September 30, 2011 and the remainder will be paid no later than March 1, 2017.  In July 2013, the Yantai local government informed the Company that the Shandong Province has promulgated a new local regulation. The regulation stated that all underground mines in the territory which has a production of under 40,000 tonnes per year will all be forced to close down before the end of 2015. As such, since Cunli Ji Mine falls within the category, the Company decided to sell the mine for money and to invest in mines in other territories, which includes investing in mine exploration areas, and, acquiring or leasing some tailings environmental protection projects.  On March 31, 2014, the Company signed an agreement with Yantai Jinjian Smelting Technology Limited (85%) and Yantai Jihao Trading Limited (15%), where 100% interests in XinGuan was transferred for a total consideration of approximately $7,300,000 (Equivalent to RMB45 million). It resulted in a profit of RMB9,000,000 for the Company compared with the original acquisition consideration in 2010.  Current Operations  Dayuan Mine  We do not own the Dayuan Mine. We leased the mine through Jinguan.  On May 6, 2011, we, through our VIE, Yantai Jinguan Investment Co., Ltd. ("Jinguan"), entered into a lease agreement with Longkou Dayuan Gold Mining Co. Ltd., an unrelated third party being the legal owner and holding the mining license of the Dayuan Gold Mine ("Dayuan Mine") regarding Dayuan Gold Mine. Under the agreement, we own the operating right and income right of the Dayuan Mine and we agreed to pay the aggregate rental payments of approximately $20 million for a term of 10 years commencing from April 1, 2011 through April 1, 2021 to obtain the right to manage and operate Dayuan Gold Mine in the repayment schedule, whereas we are committed to pay an upfront payment of $12 million equal to 6 years' rental, no later than September 30, 2011 and the remainder will be paid no later than March 1, 2017.  The Dayuan Mine has one exploration right and one mining right, which are granted by the Land and Resources Authority of Shandong Province and are unpatented. The concession period of the mining right is from 29 December 2010 to 29 December 2013. The mine is 0.3475 sq, km in area and is deposited in a lode or vein filled with mineral in the rock.  The Dayuan Mine commenced exploratory operation in July 2011. Mineral exploration was temporary halted in the Dayuan Mine during the Chinese New Year holiday in January and February 2014 and hence no gold concentrate was produced in these two months. In January 2015, the Safety Production Committee of the Longkou city government announced that all mines except coal mines were required to shut down operation during February 11, 2015 to March 5, 2015 for safety examination, technologies upgrade and maintenance. Hence, for the three months ended March 31, 2015, the mineral exploration in the Dayuan Mine was halted again and there was no gold ore production during the period.  Currently we derive our revenue from the sales of non-refined gold concentrates extracted from Dayuan Mine. Our expenses are mainly amortization of mining rights, the direct costs associated with the operation and overhead expenses such as staff salaries, smelting and extracting fee, depreciation of mining plants and other general administrative expenses.  At the moment, we are formulating an exploration plan and related timetable for the Dayuan mine. So far, there is no detailed plan to conduct exploration on the Dayuan Mine. The exploration programs of the Dayuan mines are currently funded by the internal fund generated from our operations and we have no further plan to fund the exploration programs of the mine.  Others  On February 21, 2014, SSIC acquired 99% shareholdings of Daxinganling Yiguanyuan Mining Investment Company Limited ("DYM") for a consideration of RMB4,000,000. DYM focuses on mine exploration in the Daxinganling area in the Heilongjiang Province in north-eastern part of China. DYM has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Daxinganling Guolin Mining Company Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Daxinganling local government in July 2013, which stated that the two parties would cooperate together to explore the precious metals mines in the Daxinganling area. As of March 31, 2016, no exploratory work or other operating activities have been commenced.  Results of Operations  We do not believe there have been any recent trends in production, sales, inventory, or the state of the costs or selling prices of our products since the financial year ending 2009, nor any known trends, uncertainties, demands, commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our net sales or revenues, income from continuing operations, profitability, liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported financial information not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or financial condition.  The following tables set forth key components of our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. All numbers referenced are in U.S. Dollars:   Three months ended March 31, Increase % Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease) (Decrease) Revenues, net: $ - $ - Cost of revenue - (716,078) (716,078) (100%) Gross loss - (716,078) (716,078) (100%) General and administrative expense (412,311) (208,924) 203,387 97% Loss from operations (412,311) (925,002) (512,691) (55%) Other income (expense) Interest expense (110,153) (84,291) 25,862 31% Interest income 22 59 (37) (63%) Loss before income taxes (522,442) (1,009,234) (486,792) (48%) Income tax expenses - - NET LOSS $ (522,442) $ (1,009,234) (486,792) (48%) Other comprehensive income: - Foreign currency translation adjustment (77,238) (30,762) 46,476 151% COMPREHENSIVE LOSS $ (599,680) (1,039,996) (440,316) (42%) Net loss per share - Basic and diluted $ (0.02) $ (0.01) Weighted average common stock outstanding (Basic and diluted) 28,750,000 28,750,000  Revenue  We commenced gold mineral exploration activity in May 2009 and began selling of gold concentrate in July 2009. Gold concentrate is mainly sold to smelting plants in the Shandong Province, PRC.  There was no revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. We have ceased the operation in the Dayuan mine.  Cost of Revenue  Cost of revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $0 and $716,078 respectively, and consisted primarily of direct materials, direct labor, extracting fees, and other operating overhead. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily attributable to the substantial decrease in mining related depreciation and amortization.  Gross Loss  We recorded a gross loss of $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $716,078 or 100%, from $716,078 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly attributable to the reduced mining related depreciation and amortization during the halted operation in the first quarter of 2017.  General and Administrative Expenses  General and administrative expenses comprised mainly of salaries and staff welfare expenses, legal and professional fees, entertainment expenses, traveling and hotel accommodation expenses and office expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $203,387 or 97%, from $208,924 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $412,311 for the three months ended March 31, 2017,.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expenses amounted to $0 for both the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  We have subsidiaries and VIEs that operated in various countries: United States, British Virgin Islands, Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China that are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate, as follows:  United States of America  We are incorporated in the State of Nevada and are subject to the tax laws of the United States of America. Since no income is derived in the US, we believe that we are not subject to US taxes.  British Virgin Islands  Under the current BVI law, BSL is not subject to tax on its income or profits. In addition, dividends and capital gains from our investments in the BVI are not subject to income taxes and no withholding tax is imposed on payments of dividends to the Company.  Hong Kong  GWIL is subject to Hong Kong Profits Tax, which is charged at the statutory income rate of 16.5% on its assessable income.  The PRC  We have generated all of our income through our subsidiaries and VIEs operating in the PRC for the three months ended March 31, 2017. All entities in the PRC are subject to the Corporate Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China (the "New CIT Law") at a unified income tax rate of 25%.  Net loss  We recorded a net loss of $522,442 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease in loss of $486,792 from $1,009,234 for the three months ended March 31, 3016. The decrease in loss was mainly attributable to the decrease in gross loss of $0 .  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Our primary liquidity needs are to fund operational expenses, capital expenditures and potential acquisition of gold mining properties in the Shandong province. To date, we have financed our working capital requirements and capital expenditures through internally generated cash and capital contribution from our existing shareholders.  As of March 31, 2017, our current assets were $1,307,853, and our current liabilities were $11,362,966. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $116,905 as of March 31, 2017. Accumulated deficits at March 31, 2017 were $17,563,284.  Net cash used in operating activities was $352,625 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $1,754,385 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities decreased by $1,401,760 was primarily due to the decrease in deposits and prepayments for the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $0 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $301,367 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $301,367 was primarily due to the absence of payments on leased mining rights that amounted to $298,189.  Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $405,506 for three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $2,296,905 for three months ended March 31, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by $1,891,399 was primarily due to the decrease in proceeds from loans payable.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships.  Note payable from a related party  As of March 31, 2017, amount due to a related party represented temporary advances made by Mr. Zhang, the director of the Company, which was unsecured, interest-free with no fixed repayment term. Imputed interest is considered insignificant..

Plan of Operation



China ShouGuan Mining Corporation ("ShouGuan", "we" and the "Company") was
incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 4, 2010. We are a holding company
that conducts business operations through BSL, our operating company, and its
subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) in Shandong Province in the
People's Republic of China ("PRC").
Mr. Feize Zhang, our Chairman and CEO, Mr. JingFengLv, our CTO and Mr. Jianxi
Yang, a director of YantaiJinGuan Investment Limited, founded SSIC in December
2008 and later in early 2009 established SSIC's subsidiaries JinGuan and
XinGuan. These executive officers and managers are experts in China who
specialize in mining technologies, mining resources management and financial and
strategic management. Our primary focus is on acquiring existing gold mine
projects in Shandong province of the PRC. These potential targets are mostly run
with low productivity because of inadequate funds and primitive technologies. We
plan to re-engineer and redevelop these gold mines through the transfer of
advanced exploration and mining technologies, capital injection and effective
management.
These advanced exploration and mining technologies include mining data
collection and analysis, identification of ore locations and running trends of
veins, design of exploration and mining plans, on-site mine construction
planning, formulation and customization of mining methodologies, introduction of
modern exploration and mining technologies, supervision of subcontracting staff
and provision of technical supports in relation to production management, mine
ventilation, water discharge, system upgrade, quality assurance, safety control,
etc. The underground mining works,



                                       30


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
like digging tunnels and wells and the underground transport of ore extracts
will all be outsourced to third party subcontractors.
Our business model includes sourcing of early stage gold mines with good profit
potential, conducting feasibility studies to identify suitable projects, leasing
the suitable mining sites and facilities, and managing the mineral exploration
operations on these selected sites, with the goal of acquiring the mine if the
operations prove to be satisfactory, based on the review criteria set by our
experienced management. To date, we have leased the Dayuan Mine. So far we do
not have any plan to acquire the Dayuan Mine. In near future, we tend to focus
our business on the exploratory work of these mines. In addition, we provide
consulting services in areas related to mine exploration and geological analysis
to our clients.
Under the specific requirements of the SEC's Industry Guide 7(a) 4(i), we are
deemed as an exploration company principally engaging in gold mine exploration
and exportation activities given our mines are without known reserves. Raw rocks
containing gold mineral are dug from the gold mines that are owned or leased by
us and are converted to gold concentrate through a number of physical processes.
Revenues are derived from the sales of gold concentrates, the principal raw
material used in gold smelting operation to produce gold. At that time, the
selling prices are determined from two factors, the amount of gold in the gold
concentrates and the price of gold on the date of sale. The amount of gold in
the gold concentrates is determined and agreed between the Company and the
smelters and then the selling price is determined according to the official gold
price at the time of sale as indicated by the Shanghai Gold Exchange
(http://www.sge.sh), an entity governed by the PRC Government.  In order to
minimize the effect of fluctuations of gold price and to
achieve better economies of scale in operations, the Company decides to focus
more on mine exploration.
On the consulting side, revenues are derived on a project-by-project basis and
payment is collected as we complete our services as outlined in the scope of
each individual project. In the coming years, we expect there will be more
projects on exploratory consulting services.
We target to grow proactively through continual sourcing of existing gold mines
in the PRC and managing them. These projects will be executed by BSL and its
subsidiaries, VIEs or related companies in China. CunliJi Gold Mine was the
first project commenced in May 2009. To ensure all mines are legally and
properly operated, all target gold mines are required to have full sets of
government-approved licenses before effecting commencement of any business
operations.
There is a limited supply of desirable gold mines in the PRC and we face strong
competition for gold mining rights from other gold mining companies, most of
which have greater financial resources than we have, so we may not be able to
acquire any attractive gold mining rights we find on acceptable terms.
Mining rights are amortized based on actual units of production over estimated
proven and/ or probable reserves of the mines, subject to impairment. We intend
to carefully review the mineral exploration plans and the reserve levels of our
mines periodically. Accordingly, any material change in mineral exploration s
may have a negative impact on our operating results.





                                       31


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our mineral exploration activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards
typical in the mining industry, including:



· environmental hazards;

· industrial accidents;

· unusual or unexpected geologic formations;
· explosive rock failures; and
· flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather
conditions.
Any such risks could result in:
· damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities;

· personal injury or death;

· environmental damage;

· delays in mining;

· monetary losses; and

· legal liability.



In addition, during the course of mineral exploration activities, we use
dangerous materials. We have established stringent rules relating to the
storage, handling and use of such dangerous materials, however, accidents could
still occur. Should we be held liable for any such accident, we may be subject
to penalties, and possible criminal proceedings may be brought against our
Company, BSL, its subsidiaries and/or VIEs or any of the employees.
We emphasize environmental protection in our operations and related activities,
and a significant financial commitment has been made towards the construction of
environmental protection facilities and the establishment of a sound
environmental protection management and monitoring system. We are currently in
compliance with applicable environmental regulations of the PRC government, but
any changes to these regulations may increase our operating costs, which could
adversely affect our results of operations.
We are also subject to numerous PRC rules and regulations governing the mining
industry, which are disclosed in detail in the Description of Business section
of this report. Our inability to comply with any of these current or future
rules and/or regulations could severely impact our operations and financial
condition.
In addition, we provide mining management consulting services to third party
clients as an additional source of revenue. We only provide mining consulting
services to mine owners. We do not own, rent or participate in the mine
operations of these clients. Instead, we utilize the described expertise of our
management team to help clients assess their mine conditions and provide
technical advice, guidance and suggestions to further improve management and
operations of their mines, based on our management's experience.



Current Operations



On May 6, 2011, we, through our VIE, YantaiJinguan Investment Co., Ltd.
("Jinguan"), entered into a lease agreement with LongkouDayuan Gold Mining Co.
Ltd., an unrelated third party being the legal owner and holding the mining
license of the Dayuan Gold Mine ("Dayuan Mine") regarding Dayuan Gold Mine.
Under the agreement, we



                                       32


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agreed to pay the aggregate rental payments of approximately $20 million for a
term of 10 years commencing from April 1, 2011 through April 1, 2021 to obtain
the right to manage and operate Dayuan Gold Mine in the repayment schedule,
whereas we are committed to pay an upfront payment of $12 million equal to 6
years' rental, no later than September 30, 2011 and the remainder will be paid
no later than March 1, 2017. Concurrently, we entered into an equipment transfer
agreement (the "Transfer Agreement") with Longkou Datong Industry and Trade Co.,
Ltd. for the acquisition of mining assets and auxiliary equipment currently
being used in the Dayuan Gold Mine at a purchase price of approximately $2.3
million.




Dayuan Mine
We do not own the Dayuan Mine. We leased the mine through Jinguan. The Dayuan
Mine is currently owned by LongkouDayuan Gold Mining Co. Ltd. ("LDGM"). Based on
the lease agreement signed by LDGM and Jinguan, LDGM leased the Dayuan Mine to
Jinguan for a term of 10 years from April 1, 2011 to April 1, 2021 for a total
rental payment of RMB130 million (approximately $20 million). Jinguan was
committed to pay an upfront payment of $12 million no later than September 30,
2011 and the remainder will be paid no later than March 1, 2017. Under this
agreement, we own the operating right and income right of the Dayuan Mine.
The Dayuan Mine has one exploration right and one mining right, which are
granted by the Land and Resources Authority of Shandong Province and are
unpatented. The concession period of the mining right is from 29 December 2010
to 29 December 2013. The mine is 0.3475 sq, km in area and is deposited in a
lode or vein filled with mineral in the rock.
The Dayuan Mine commenced exploratory operation in July 2011.
Currently we derive our revenue from the sales of non-refined gold concentrates
extracted from Dayuan Mine. Our expenses are mainly amortization of mining
rights, the direct costs associated with the operation and overhead expenses
such as staff salaries, smelting and extracting fee, depreciation of mining
plants and other general administrative expenses.
At the moment, we are formulating an exploration plan and related timetable for
the Dayuan mine. So far, there is no detailed plan to conduct exploration on the
Dayuan Mine. The exploration programs of the mine are currently funded by the
internal fund generated from our operations and we have no further plan to fund
the exploration programs of the mine.


Results of Operations



We do not believe there have been any recent trends in production, sales,
inventory, or the state of the costs or selling prices of our products since the
financial year ending 2009, nor any known trends, uncertainties, demands,
commitments or events that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on
our net sales or revenues, income from continuing operations, profitability,
liquidity or capital resources, or that would cause reported financial
information not necessarily to be indicative of future operating results or
financial condition.
The following table set forth key components of our results of operations for
the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.

There was no revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ended
December 31, 2015.  We have ceased the operation in the Dayuan mine.



Cost of Revenue



Cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $374,713 and
$3,112,671 respectively, and consisted primarily of direct materials, direct
labor, extracting fees, other operating overhead, and mining related
depreciation and amortization.



Gross Loss



We recorded a mining gross loss of $374,713 for the year ended December 31,
2016, an increase of $2,737,958 or 88%, from gross loss of $3,112,671 for the
year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to the
absence of revenue in 2016.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses comprised mainly of impairment charge and
salaries and staff welfare expenses, legal and professional fees, entertainment
expenses, traveling and hotel accommodation expenses and office expenses.
General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016,
increased by $4,058,401 or 740%, from $548,758 to $4,607,159 for the same
comparable period in 2016, due to $3,262,157 impairment loss on property, plant
and equipment, prepaid mining rights and account receivable relating to Dayuan
mine






                                       35


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Income Tax Expense
There was no income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for the
year ended December 31, 2015.



Net Loss



We recorded a net loss of $5,373,718 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an
increase of $1,449,508 from a net loss of $3,924,210 for the year ended December
31, 2015. The increase in net loss was mainly attributable to the increase in
general and administrative expenses.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our primary liquidity needs are to fund operational expenses, capital
expenditures and potential acquisition of gold mining properties in the Shandong
province. To date, we have financed our working capital requirements and capital
expenditures through internally generated cash and capital contribution from our
existing shareholders.
As of December 31, 2016, our current assets were $1,365,829 and our current
liabilities were $10,866,833. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $68,134 as of
December 31, 2016. Stockholders' deficit at December 31, 2016 was $8,516,183.
Net cash used in operating activities was $2,006,116 for the year ended December
31, 2016 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $1,994,326 for
the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in operating activities
increased by $11,790 was primarily due to the increase in net loss.
Net cash used in investing activities amounted to $3,128 for the year ended
December 31, 2016 as compared to net cash used in investing activities of
$314,972 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash used in investing
activities decreased by $311,844 was primarily due to the absence of payment on
leased mining rights in 2016.
Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $1,972,422 for the year
ended December 31, 2016 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities
of $2,240,175 for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net cash provided by
financing activities decreased by $267,753, primarily due to the increase in
repayments to loans payable.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, financings or other relationships.



Statutory Reserve



Under the PRC Law, the Company, BSL and its subsidiaries and variable interest
entities in the PRC are required to make appropriation to the statutory reserve
based on after-tax net earnings and determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles of the People's Republic of China (the "PRC
GAAP"). Appropriation to the statutory reserve should be at least 10% of the
after-tax net income until the reserve is equal to 50% of the registered
capital. The statutory reserve is established for the purpose of providing
employee facilities and other collective benefits to the employees and is
non-distributable other than in liquidation.



                                       36


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company contributed $0 and
$0 to statutory reserve, respectively.
Commitments and Contingencies
We are committed under several non-cancelable operating leases for office
premises with the terms ranging from 1 to 2 years, with fixed monthly rentals or
scheduled payments. Total rent expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016
and 2015 was $133,163 and $103,722, respectively.
As of December 31, 2016, we have the aggregate future minimum rental payments
due under various non-cancelable operating leases in the next two years:



                    Year ending December 31,
                    2017                                     110,379
                    2018                                       9,198

                    Total:                                 $ 119,577





Subsequent Events




In accordance with ASC Topic 855, " Subsequent Events ", which establishes
general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after
the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued, we have
evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after December 31, 2016 up
through the date we issued the audited consolidated financial statements.
A one for four reverse stock split was accepted by FINRA on March 13, 2017.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of the Company's results of operations and liquidity
and capital resources are based on our audited consolidated financial statements
for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of consolidated
financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about
future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures. The assumptions,
estimates and judgments included within these estimates are based on historical
experience, current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the
time the consolidated financial statements were prepared. On a regular basis,
the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments are reviewed to
ensure that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because future events and their effects
cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from the
assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions are used for, but are
not limited to: (1) inventory costs and reserves; (2) asset impairments (3) and
depreciable lives of assets. Future events and their effects cannot be predicted
with certainty, and accordingly, accounting estimates require the exercise of
judgment. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements will change as new events occur,



                                       37


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as our
operating environment changes. We evaluate and update these assumptions and
estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist us with
these evaluations. Actual results could differ from the estimates that have been
used.
Significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 3, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, to the accompanying audited consolidated financial
statements. We believe the following accounting policies are the most critical
to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, as
they require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments, and
to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.



Basis of Consolidation



The audited consolidated financial statements include the financial statements
of the Company, BSL and its subsidiaries and VIEs. All inter-company balances
and transactions between the Company, BSL and its subsidiaries and VIEs were
eliminated upon consolidation. We adopted the Accounting Standards Codification
("ASC") Topic 810-10-5-8, "Variable Interest Entities". ASC Topic 810-10-5-8
requires a variable interest entity or VIE to be consolidated by a company if
that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss for the VIEs or is
entitled to receive a majority of the VIEs' residual returns.
Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)
The Company, through BSL's subsidiary, SBCL, entered into a series of agreements
("VIE agreements") with SSIC, JinGuan and DYM, and the individual owners of
SSIC, JinGuan and DYM (see NOTE below), and details of the VIE agreements are as
follows:



   1.   Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement, - SBCL
        has the exclusive right to provide to SSIC, JinGuan and DYM consulting
        services, including operational management, human resources management,
        research and development of the technologies related to the operations
        of SSIC, JinGuan and DYM. SSIC, JinGuan and DYM pays to SBCL annually
        consulting service fees in an amount equal to all of their revenue for
        such year. These agreements run for a 10-year term and are subject to
        automatic renewal for an additional 10 years, provided that no objection
        is made by both parties on the renewal.

   2.   Exclusive Option Agreement - SBCL has the option to purchase all assets
        and ownership of SSIC, JinGuan and DYM at any time.

   3.   Equity Pledge Agreement - SSIC, JinGuan and DYM agree to pledge their
        legal interest to SBCL as a security for the obligations under the
        Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement.

   4.   Proxy Agreement - SSIC, JinGuan and DYM irrevocably grant and entrust
        SBCL the right to exercise its voting and other stockholder rights.





                                       38


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



   5.   Operating Agreement - SBCL agrees to participate in the operations of
        SSIC, JinGuan and DYM

        NOTE: All of the aforesaid agreements were signed and effective on May
        15, 2010, except the ones signed with DYM which were signed and
        effective on February 21, 2014. Also, a former VIE, XinGuan (which held
        the CunliJi mine), was sold to two third parties on March 31, 2014 and
        as of that date XinGuan ceased to be a VIE in the group.  .



With the above agreements, SBCL demonstrates its ability to control SSIC,
JinGuan and DYM as the primary beneficiary.
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
All long-lived assets such as property, plant and equipment held and used by the
Company reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is evaluated by a comparison of the
carrying amount of assets to estimated discounted net cash flows expected to be
generated by the assets. Future cash flows are based on estimated quantities of
gold and other recoverable metals, expected price of gold and other commodity
(considering current and historical prices, price trends and related factors),
production levels and cash costs of production, capital and reclamation costs,
all based on detailed engineering life-of-mine plans. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the
amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value of the
assets.
Numerous factors including, but not limited to, such things as unexpected grade
changes, gold recovery problems, shortages of equipment and consumables,
equipment failures, and collapse of pit walls, could impact our ability to
achieve forecasted production schedules from proven and probable reserves.
Additionally, commodity prices, capital expenditure requirements and reclamation
costs could differ from the assumptions used in the cash flow models used to
assess impairment. The ability to achieve the estimated quantities of
recoverable minerals from exploration stage mineral interests involves further
risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven
and probable reserves have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence
that the identified mineralized material can ultimately be mined economically.



Revenue Recognition


We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, transfer
of title has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed
or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
We derive revenues from the sales of non-refined gold concentrate, whereas it
usually takes 6 days for the production from non-refined gold concentrate to
gold bullion. We generally recognize revenues, net of value-added taxes ("VAT")
at the time the gold bullion is produced and delivered to the customers,
smelters and/or refineries.
We are generally subject to VAT which is levied on the majority of the products
at the standard rate of 17% on the invoiced value of sales.; however, our VIE,
PXIL has been granted preferential tax treatment under the Chinese tax law of
the "Notice from Ministry of Finance and State Tax Bureau in Relation to
Exemption of Value Added Tax on Gold Production" and "Notice regarding issues on
Tax Policy on Gold Transaction", whereas gold produced and sold by gold mining
and smelting enterprises are exempted from VAT.



                                       39


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interest income is recognized on a time apportionment basis, taking into account
the principal amounts outstanding and the interest rates applicable.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

 China Shouguan Investment Holding Group Corp	
Business Description








China ShouGuan Mining Corporation was incorporated in the State of Nevada on 
  May 4, 2010. We are a holding company that conducts business operations in Shandong 
  Province in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). On June 23, 2010, we 
  entered into a stock exchange transaction with the shareholders of Bei Sheng 
  Limited (“BSL”), whereby we issued 100,000,000 shares of common 
  stock in exchange for 100% of the ownership interest in BSL, for the purpose 
  of re-domiciling BSL as a Nevada corporation in the United States. 
We were founded by a number of business professionals and experts in China 
  who specialize in mining technologies, mining resources management and financial 
  and strategic management. Our primary focus is on acquiring existing gold mine 
  in Shandong province of the PRC. These potential targets are mostly run with 
  low productivity because of inadequate funds and primitive technologies. We 
  plan to re-engineer and redevelop these gold mines through the transfer of advanced 
  exploration and mining technologies, capital injection and effective management.

  Our business model includes sourcing of early stage gold mines with good profit 
  potential, conducting feasibility studies to identify suitable projects, leasing 
  the suitable mining sites and facilities and managing the mining operations 
  on these selected sites, with the goal of acquiring the mine if the operations 
  prove to be satisfactory based on the review criteria set by our experienced 
  management. In addition, we also provide consulting services in areas related 
  to mine exploration and analysis to our clients on a project-by-project basis.

  Revenues are derived from the sales of gold concentrates, the principal raw 
  material used in gold smelting operation to produce gold. The mineral exploratory 
  activities of the CunliJi Mine are outsourced to Chongqing Yitong Mine Construction 
  Engineering Co., Ltd. (“CYMC”), an independent third-party subcontractor, 
  and we only take possession of the gold concentrates when they are sold to smelters. 
  At that time, the selling prices are determined from two factors, the amount 
  of gold in the gold concentrates and the price of gold on the date of sale. 
  The amount of gold in the gold concentrates is determined and agreed upon between 
  the Company and the smelters and then the selling price is determined according 
  to the official gold price at the time of sale as indicated by the Shanghai 
  Gold Exchange (http://www.sge.sh), an entity governed by the PRC Government). 
  On the consulting side, revenues are derived on a project-by-project basis and 
  payment is collected as we complete our service as outlined in the scope of 
  each individual project. In order to minimize the effect of fluctuations of 
  gold price and to achieve better economies of scale in operations, the Company 
  decides to focus more on mine exploration.
We target to grow proactively through continual sourcing of existing gold mines 
  in the PRC and managing them. These projects will be executed by BSL and its 
  VIEs. CunliJi Gold Mine was the first project commenced in May 2009. To ensure 
  all mines are legally and properly operated, all target gold mines are required 
  to have full sets of government-approved licenses before effecting commencement 
  of any business operations.
