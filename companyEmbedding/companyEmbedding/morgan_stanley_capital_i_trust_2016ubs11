                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch to Rate Morgan Stanley Capital I Trust 2016-UBS11 Commercial 
      Mtge Pass-Through Certificates






August 08, 2016 03:23 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report for Morgan Stanley Capital I 
      Trust 2016-UBS11 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$42,100,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$60,300,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$55,900,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$170,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$175,531,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$503,831,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$128,657,000a class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$60,280,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$34,189,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$34,188,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$36,888,000ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17,994,000ab class X-E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$7,198,000ab class X-F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$36,888,000b class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17,994,000b class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$7,198,000b class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (b) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Aug. 5, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the $25,191,662 class X-G 
      or the $25,191,662 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 38 loans secured by 75 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $719.8 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by UBS Real Estate Securities, Inc., KeyBank National Association, 
      Natixis Real Estate Capital LLC, and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital 
      Holdings LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.4% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 89.9%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Low Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than those 
      of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The 
      pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.30x and 99.8%, respectively, are 
      better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.16x and 
      107.5%, respectively. Excluding the credit-opinion loan, the pool's 
      Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV is 1.29x and 103.7%, respectively.
    

      High Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans comprise 65.6% of the pool, 
      which is greater than the YTD 2016 average of 54.6% and the 2015 average 
      of 49.3%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 553, which is 
      greater than the YTD 2016 and the 2015 averages of 420 and 367, 
      respectively.
    

      High Lodging Exposure: Approximately 36.0% of the pool by balance, 
      including eight of the top 20 loans, is comprised of hotel properties. 
      Hotel concentration in the pool is greater than the YTD 2016 and 2015 
      averages of 16.3% and 17.0%, respectively. Two of the top 10 loans, 132 
      West 27th Street (9.5% of the pool) and Fairfield Inn Time Square Fee 
      (6.8% of the pool), are classified as hotels but are collateralized by a 
      net lease and leased fee interest, respectively. Excluding these two 
      loans, the hotel concentration is 19.7%, which is higher than the YTD 
      2016 and 2015 averages, respectively. Hotels have the highest 
      probability of default in Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 20.5% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSC 
      2016-UBS11 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.
    

      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
    

      A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under 'Related Research' below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' (May 2016).

(a) Notional amount and interest-only.


                                        








(b) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.


                                        








The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Aug. 5, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the $25,191,662 class X-G 
      or the $25,191,662 class G.


                                        








The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 38 loans secured by 75 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $719.8 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by UBS Real Estate Securities, Inc., KeyBank National Association, 
      Natixis Real Estate Capital LLC, and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital 
      Holdings LLC.


                                        








Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.4% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 89.9%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Low Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than those 
      of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The 
      pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.30x and 99.8%, respectively, are 
      better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.16x and 
      107.5%, respectively. Excluding the credit-opinion loan, the pool's 
      Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV is 1.29x and 103.7%, respectively.


                                        








High Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans comprise 65.6% of the pool, 
      which is greater than the YTD 2016 average of 54.6% and the 2015 average 
      of 49.3%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 553, which is 
      greater than the YTD 2016 and the 2015 averages of 420 and 367, 
      respectively.


                                        








High Lodging Exposure: Approximately 36.0% of the pool by balance, 
      including eight of the top 20 loans, is comprised of hotel properties. 
      Hotel concentration in the pool is greater than the YTD 2016 and 2015 
      averages of 16.3% and 17.0%, respectively. Two of the top 10 loans, 132 
      West 27th Street (9.5% of the pool) and Fairfield Inn Time Square Fee 
      (6.8% of the pool), are classified as hotels but are collateralized by a 
      net lease and leased fee interest, respectively. Excluding these two 
      loans, the hotel concentration is 19.7%, which is higher than the YTD 
      2016 and 2015 averages, respectively. Hotels have the highest 
      probability of default in Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 20.5% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSC 
      2016-UBS11 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.


                                        








REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS


                                        








A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under 'Related Research' below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' (May 2016).

Fitch does not rate the $25,191,662 class X-G or the $25,191,662 class G.


                                        








The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 38 loans secured by 75 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $719.8 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by UBS Real Estate Securities, Inc., KeyBank National Association, 
      Natixis Real Estate Capital LLC, and Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital 
      Holdings LLC.


                                        








Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.4% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 89.9%, and asset summary reviews on 100% of the pool.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








Low Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than those 
      of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The 
      pool's Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.30x and 99.8%, respectively, are 
      better than the YTD 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.16x and 
      107.5%, respectively. Excluding the credit-opinion loan, the pool's 
      Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV is 1.29x and 103.7%, respectively.


                                        








High Pool Concentration: The top 10 loans comprise 65.6% of the pool, 
      which is greater than the YTD 2016 average of 54.6% and the 2015 average 
      of 49.3%. The pool's loan concentration index (LCI) is 553, which is 
      greater than the YTD 2016 and the 2015 averages of 420 and 367, 
      respectively.


                                        








High Lodging Exposure: Approximately 36.0% of the pool by balance, 
      including eight of the top 20 loans, is comprised of hotel properties. 
      Hotel concentration in the pool is greater than the YTD 2016 and 2015 
      averages of 16.3% and 17.0%, respectively. Two of the top 10 loans, 132 
      West 27th Street (9.5% of the pool) and Fairfield Inn Time Square Fee 
      (6.8% of the pool), are classified as hotels but are collateralized by a 
      net lease and leased fee interest, respectively. Excluding these two 
      loans, the hotel concentration is 19.7%, which is higher than the YTD 
      2016 and 2015 averages, respectively. Hotels have the highest 
      probability of default in Fitch's multiborrower CMBS model.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 20.5% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to MSC 
      2016-UBS11 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on the analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.

A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and 
      enforcement mechanisms (RW&Es) that are disclosed in the offering 
      document and which relate to the underlying asset pool is available by 
      accessing the appendix referenced under 'Related Research' below. The 
      appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es to those Fitch 
      considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special Report 
      titled 'Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' (May 2016).
