History[edit]
Reorganized in 1984 as a privately held company, Fiserv transformed itself through a corporate acquisitions strategy resulting in more than 150 acquisitions during the following 25 years. Beginning as a $21 million business with 350 employees, by 2009 it had become a Fortune 500 company worth $4.7 billion with more than 19,000 employees.[6]
Fiserv started on July 31, 1984, when Sunshine State Systems, Inc., based in Tampa, Florida, and First Data Processing, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, combined to form Fiserv, Inc.[7] Two years later in 1986, Fiserv went public as a $70 million data processor company.[8] Within four years of becoming public, Fiserv was serving a number of large financial institutions in the United States.[8]
In 1991, Fiserv acquired Citicorp Information Resources, a subsidiary of Citicorp. This acquisition put Fiserv into the commercial banking, internal and credit union core account processing market space.[6] Then, in 1995, Fiserv acquired Information Technology, Inc., (ITI), in Lincoln, Nebraska, expanding its number of account processing clients, and gaining, at that time, the most widely implemented account processing platform in the United States, Premier.[6] In 1998, Fiserv reached $1 billion in revenue.[8] Later, in 2007, Fiserv made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring CheckFree Corporation, the leading provider of online banking, online bill payment, electronic bill payment services, and software for check clearance and Automated Clearing House (ACH) processing.[6]
In 2011, the company purchased M-Com, a provider of mobile banking applications;[9] and CashEdge (Popmoney), a provider of electronic funds transfer services.[10] Two years later, the company purchased Open Solutions (DNA).[11] In October 2013, Fiserv announced that it will offer Guardian Analytics products for its clients to secure online banking channels.[12]

History[edit]
Reorganized in 1984 as a privately held company, Fiserv transformed itself through a corporate acquisitions strategy resulting in more than 150 acquisitions during the following 25 years. Beginning as a $21 million business with 350 employees, by 2009 it had become a Fortune 500 company worth $4.7 billion with more than 19,000 employees.[6]
Fiserv started on July 31, 1984, when Sunshine State Systems, Inc., based in Tampa, Florida, and First Data Processing, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, combined to form Fiserv, Inc.[7] Two years later in 1986, Fiserv went public as a $70 million data processor company.[8] Within four years of becoming public, Fiserv was serving a number of large financial institutions in the United States.[8]
In 1991, Fiserv acquired Citicorp Information Resources, a subsidiary of Citicorp. This acquisition put Fiserv into the commercial banking, internal and credit union core account processing market space.[6] Then, in 1995, Fiserv acquired Information Technology, Inc., (ITI), in Lincoln, Nebraska, expanding its number of account processing clients, and gaining, at that time, the most widely implemented account processing platform in the United States, Premier.[6] In 1998, Fiserv reached $1 billion in revenue.[8] Later, in 2007, Fiserv made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring CheckFree Corporation, the leading provider of online banking, online bill payment, electronic bill payment services, and software for check clearance and Automated Clearing House (ACH) processing.[6]
In 2011, the company purchased M-Com, a provider of mobile banking applications;[9] and CashEdge (Popmoney), a provider of electronic funds transfer services.[10] Two years later, the company purchased Open Solutions (DNA).[11] In October 2013, Fiserv announced that it will offer Guardian Analytics products for its clients to secure online banking channels.[12]

Sarah
Customer Solutions | Electronic Payments | Hickory, NC
As a Customer Solutions associate on the Electronic Payments team, I support bank customers with their bill pay concerns and educate them on how they can get the most service from our bill pay solutions.
One thing I’ve personally taken advantage of is the tuition reimbursement program. Fiserv encourages its associates to grow both professionally and personally, and part of that has meant them supporting my education. If the course or degree applies to what we do as a company, they’ll reimburse you for a portion of the tuition. Even inside the company, with the training and onboarding, Fiserv really seeks to broaden our knowledge base. The opportunities are there to take advantage of if you want to advance yourself and your personal skills.

Manager, Client Tech Support | Credit Union Solutions | Salt Lake City, UT
Fiserv invests a lot in its employees. I just completed an 11-week Managing Matters course with an offsite capstone project that was very beneficial to me in improving various management skills. Our company is always looking to invest in its employees, improve the talent level of its associates, and find ways to increase and provide opportunities to expand skills. It’s just a very open and collaborative environment. The leaders and the company are definitely engaged. I’ve had a lot of mentoring from my managers, and I’ve noticed they’ve asked for feedback from associates.

The leadership skills I learned in the military have been very useful in informal leadership situations at Fiserv. Civilian, corporate jobs are different than the military. They’re good, but different, so don't expect things to be the same.

History[edit]
Reorganized in 1984 as a privately held company, Fiserv transformed itself through a corporate acquisitions strategy resulting in more than 150 acquisitions during the following 25 years. Beginning as a $21 million business with 350 employees, by 2009 it had become a Fortune 500 company worth $4.7 billion with more than 19,000 employees.[6]
Fiserv started on July 31, 1984, when Sunshine State Systems, Inc., based in Tampa, Florida, and First Data Processing, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, combined to form Fiserv, Inc.[7] Two years later in 1986, Fiserv went public as a $70 million data processor company.[8] Within four years of becoming public, Fiserv was serving a number of large financial institutions in the United States.[8]
In 1991, Fiserv acquired Citicorp Information Resources, a subsidiary of Citicorp. This acquisition put Fiserv into the commercial banking, internal and credit union core account processing market space.[6] Then, in 1995, Fiserv acquired Information Technology, Inc., (ITI), in Lincoln, Nebraska, expanding its number of account processing clients, and gaining, at that time, the most widely implemented account processing platform in the United States, Premier.[6] In 1998, Fiserv reached $1 billion in revenue.[8] Later, in 2007, Fiserv made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring CheckFree Corporation, the leading provider of online banking, online bill payment, electronic bill payment services, and software for check clearance and Automated Clearing House (ACH) processing.[6]
In 2011, the company purchased M-Com, a provider of mobile banking applications;[9] and CashEdge (Popmoney), a provider of electronic funds transfer services.[10] Two years later, the company purchased Open Solutions (DNA).[11] In October 2013, Fiserv announced that it will offer Guardian Analytics products for its clients to secure online banking channels.[12]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Reorganized in 1984 as a privately held company, Fiserv transformed itself through a corporate acquisitions strategy resulting in more than 150 acquisitions during the following 25 years. Beginning as a $21 million business with 350 employees, by 2009 it had become a Fortune 500 company worth $4.7 billion with more than 19,000 employees.[6]
Fiserv started on July 31, 1984, when Sunshine State Systems, Inc., based in Tampa, Florida, and First Data Processing, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, combined to form Fiserv, Inc.[7] Two years later in 1986, Fiserv went public as a $70 million data processor company.[8] Within four years of becoming public, Fiserv was serving a number of large financial institutions in the United States.[8]
In 1991, Fiserv acquired Citicorp Information Resources, a subsidiary of Citicorp. This acquisition put Fiserv into the commercial banking, internal and credit union core account processing market space.[6] Then, in 1995, Fiserv acquired Information Technology, Inc., (ITI), in Lincoln, Nebraska, expanding its number of account processing clients, and gaining, at that time, the most widely implemented account processing platform in the United States, Premier.[6] In 1998, Fiserv reached $1 billion in revenue.[8] Later, in 2007, Fiserv made its largest acquisition to date by acquiring CheckFree Corporation, the leading provider of online banking, online bill payment, electronic bill payment services, and software for check clearance and Automated Clearing House (ACH) processing.[6]
In 2011, the company purchased M-Com, a provider of mobile banking applications;[9] and CashEdge (Popmoney), a provider of electronic funds transfer services.[10] Two years later, the company purchased Open Solutions (DNA).[11] In October 2013, Fiserv announced that it will offer Guardian Analytics products for its clients to secure online banking channels.[12]
