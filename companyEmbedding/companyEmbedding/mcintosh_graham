McIntosh's largest integrated in both size and power, it offers 300 Watts per channel and combines their amplifier and preamplifier expertise into one comprehensive unit. It has a built-in 32-bit DAC and a DA1 Digital Audio Module, that allows future upgrades.  It includes a USB input that can support DSD256 and DXD 348kHz files.  And the MA9000 features the new McIntosh Monogrammed Heatsinks™ that are made from high quality materials with excellent thermal conductivity properties.
		







McIntosh MC1.2KW Power Amplifier
		

Producing a massive 1,200 watts, the MC1.2KW can now be auditioned at Overture.  The MC1.2KW features the extraordinary McIntosh Quad Balanced Circuit. Each amplifier consists of two balanced amplifier circuits, the outputs of which are combined in the unique, hand-crafted McIntosh Output Autoformer.  Both customers and staff alike have been astounded by their powerful bass response and extraordinary dynamic range.  Speakers of all efficiencies will benefit from the power output and reserves of the MC1.2KW's.

Fixed analog stereo outputs are available in both balanced and unbalanced offerings; a coax and optical output are also available if you prefer to send the digital audio signal to an external DAC, preamplifier or home theater processor.
		










McIntosh D1100 Preamp
		

The D1100 Digital Preamplifier is a reference level stereo preamplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Its 8-channel, 32-bit DAC is used in Quad Balanced mode, with half of it dedicated to the left audio channel and the other half to the right channel. It's the most advanced DAC McIntosh has ever used and delivers an unprecedented level of performance so that all digital music is reproduced with exceptional accuracy and authenticity.
		










McIntosh MP100 Preamp
		

The MP100 is the first dedicated phono preamplifier from McIntosh and is designed to help both new and experienced vinyl lovers get the most fidelity, performance and – most importantly – enjoyment from their albums. Hi-Fi News magazine has reviewed it and have awarded the MP100 their "Highly Commended" ranking.  "This is a clean-sounding, detailed, commanding phono amp that also represents excellent value. It’s compact, beautifully-made in the McIntosh manner and easy to use. Once the features are accounted for, especially XLR balanced out, you realise that it’s actually something of a bargain.

McIntosh's largest integrated in both size and power, it offers 300 Watts per channel and combines their amplifier and preamplifier expertise into one comprehensive unit. It has a built-in 32-bit DAC and a DA1 Digital Audio Module, that allows future upgrades.  It includes a USB input that can support DSD256 and DXD 348kHz files.  And the MA9000 features the new McIntosh Monogrammed Heatsinks™ that are made from high quality materials with excellent thermal conductivity properties.
		







McIntosh MC1.2KW Power Amplifier
		

Producing a massive 1,200 watts, the MC1.2KW can now be auditioned at Overture.  The MC1.2KW features the extraordinary McIntosh Quad Balanced Circuit. Each amplifier consists of two balanced amplifier circuits, the outputs of which are combined in the unique, hand-crafted McIntosh Output Autoformer.  Both customers and staff alike have been astounded by their powerful bass response and extraordinary dynamic range.  Speakers of all efficiencies will benefit from the power output and reserves of the MC1.2KW's.

Fixed analog stereo outputs are available in both balanced and unbalanced offerings; a coax and optical output are also available if you prefer to send the digital audio signal to an external DAC, preamplifier or home theater processor.
		










McIntosh D1100 Preamp
		

The D1100 Digital Preamplifier is a reference level stereo preamplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Its 8-channel, 32-bit DAC is used in Quad Balanced mode, with half of it dedicated to the left audio channel and the other half to the right channel. It's the most advanced DAC McIntosh has ever used and delivers an unprecedented level of performance so that all digital music is reproduced with exceptional accuracy and authenticity.
		










McIntosh MP100 Preamp
		

The MP100 is the first dedicated phono preamplifier from McIntosh and is designed to help both new and experienced vinyl lovers get the most fidelity, performance and – most importantly – enjoyment from their albums. Hi-Fi News magazine has reviewed it and have awarded the MP100 their "Highly Commended" ranking.  "This is a clean-sounding, detailed, commanding phono amp that also represents excellent value. It’s compact, beautifully-made in the McIntosh manner and easy to use. Once the features are accounted for, especially XLR balanced out, you realise that it’s actually something of a bargain.

shown that the average life
of a McIntosh may well turn
out to be one’s lifetime.

we're always adding new amazing products.

McIntosh MA 9000 Integrated Amplifier
		

The MA9000 Integrated Amplifier can help you achieve audio perfection. McIntosh's largest integrated in both size and power, it offers 300 Watts per channel and combines their amplifier and preamplifier expertise into one comprehensive unit. It has a built-in 32-bit DAC and a DA1 Digital Audio Module, that allows future upgrades.  It includes a USB input that can support DSD256 and DXD 348kHz files.  And the MA9000 features the new McIntosh Monogrammed Heatsinks™ that are made from high quality materials with excellent thermal conductivity properties.
		







McIntosh MC1.2KW Power Amplifier
		

Producing a massive 1,200 watts, the MC1.2KW can now be auditioned at Overture.  The MC1.2KW features the extraordinary McIntosh Quad Balanced Circuit. Each amplifier consists of two balanced amplifier circuits, the outputs of which are combined in the unique, hand-crafted McIntosh Output Autoformer.  Both customers and staff alike have been astounded by their powerful bass response and extraordinary dynamic range.  Speakers of all efficiencies will benefit from the power output and reserves of the MC1.2KW's.
		










McIntosh MCD350 SACD/CD Player
		

The MCD350 SACD/CD Player delivers a pure playback experience from your SACDs and CDs.  It features a balanced 2-channel, 32-bit/192kHz Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC). Fixed analog stereo outputs are available in both balanced and unbalanced offerings; a coax and optical output are also available if you prefer to send the digital audio signal to an external DAC, preamplifier or home theater processor.
		










McIntosh D1100 Preamp
		

The D1100 Digital Preamplifier is a reference level stereo preamplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Its 8-channel, 32-bit DAC is used in Quad Balanced mode, with half of it dedicated to the left audio channel and the other half to the right channel. It's the most advanced DAC McIntosh has ever used and delivers an unprecedented level of performance so that all digital music is reproduced with exceptional accuracy and authenticity.
		










McIntosh MP100 Preamp
		

The MP100 is the first dedicated phono preamplifier from McIntosh and is designed to help both new and experienced vinyl lovers get the most fidelity, performance and – most importantly – enjoyment from their albums. Hi-Fi News magazine has reviewed it and have awarded the MP100 their "Highly Commended" ranking.  "This is a clean-sounding, detailed, commanding phono amp that also represents excellent value. It’s compact, beautifully-made in the McIntosh manner and easy to use. Once the features are accounted for, especially XLR balanced out, you realise that it’s actually something of a bargain.

McIntosh's largest integrated in both size and power, it offers 300 Watts per channel and combines their amplifier and preamplifier expertise into one comprehensive unit. It has a built-in 32-bit DAC and a DA1 Digital Audio Module, that allows future upgrades.  It includes a USB input that can support DSD256 and DXD 348kHz files.  And the MA9000 features the new McIntosh Monogrammed Heatsinks™ that are made from high quality materials with excellent thermal conductivity properties.
		







McIntosh MC1.2KW Power Amplifier
		

Producing a massive 1,200 watts, the MC1.2KW can now be auditioned at Overture.  The MC1.2KW features the extraordinary McIntosh Quad Balanced Circuit. Each amplifier consists of two balanced amplifier circuits, the outputs of which are combined in the unique, hand-crafted McIntosh Output Autoformer.  Both customers and staff alike have been astounded by their powerful bass response and extraordinary dynamic range.  Speakers of all efficiencies will benefit from the power output and reserves of the MC1.2KW's.

Fixed analog stereo outputs are available in both balanced and unbalanced offerings; a coax and optical output are also available if you prefer to send the digital audio signal to an external DAC, preamplifier or home theater processor.
		










McIntosh D1100 Preamp
		

The D1100 Digital Preamplifier is a reference level stereo preamplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Its 8-channel, 32-bit DAC is used in Quad Balanced mode, with half of it dedicated to the left audio channel and the other half to the right channel. It's the most advanced DAC McIntosh has ever used and delivers an unprecedented level of performance so that all digital music is reproduced with exceptional accuracy and authenticity.
		










McIntosh MP100 Preamp
		

The MP100 is the first dedicated phono preamplifier from McIntosh and is designed to help both new and experienced vinyl lovers get the most fidelity, performance and – most importantly – enjoyment from their albums. Hi-Fi News magazine has reviewed it and have awarded the MP100 their "Highly Commended" ranking.  "This is a clean-sounding, detailed, commanding phono amp that also represents excellent value. It’s compact, beautifully-made in the McIntosh manner and easy to use. Once the features are accounted for, especially XLR balanced out, you realise that it’s actually something of a bargain.

†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
