U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. Announces Election of Director

Posted by: Nasdaq NewsFeed 
in Top News
11 days ago



PANACA, Nev., July 18, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc., (OTC Pink:USMN) is pleased to announce the election of Nathan “Nate” Marks (47) to the Board of Directors on July 11, 2017.  Mr. Marks is the owner of M & M Ag Supply in Nampa, ID.  
Mr. Marks was raised on a farm leading to his professional career in farm management.  After 6 years as a Deputy Sheriff in Idaho, he returned to his roots in farming in 2011 and formed M & M Ag Supply.   From its inception M & M Ag Supply has focused on the domestic biologic, organic farming community and has represented USMN’s Excelerite® brand products.  In just six years, Nate‘s company has become a major factor in the multi-million dollar organic products market.  Excelerite® AG is M&M Ag’s number one selling soil amendment and Excelerite® LS is its number one mineral supplement for livestock farmers.
As a Director of USMN, Mr. Marks has several concepts to develop new Excelerite® based products and create multi-dimensional marketing tie-ins with all the agricultural products that he currently represents.  Mr. Marks’s hands-on experience, superior knowledge of the myriad Excelerite® applications and his passion for natural farming is a perfect match for USMN’S dedication to improving the health and well being of people, plants and animals.

                                        Founded  in  2010,   U.S.  Rare  Earth  Minerals,   Inc.  ( commonly,  "Rare Earth Minerals" )  and                                       incorporated   under   the   laws   of   the  state  of  Nevada  ,  is  a  publicly  traded  corporation                                       (OTCQB:USMN), headquartered in Bend, Oregon, USA.                                                              The Company owns the exclusive mining, marketing, and distribution rights to a  range  of natural mineral products under the brand name    EXCELERITE®,                                                                which are packaged and sold in the United States and around the world.    Our  naturally  occurring  chelated  minerals,  carefully  mined  from  an  ancient,                                                               geothermally active, ocean/lakebed caldera basin in southeastern Nevada, are among some of the richest bio-available deposits known and commercially                                                               available worldwide.                                                U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. aims to play a significant role in the enhancement of soil, plant, animal, and human health                                                 throughout  the  world  by  ensuring the quality, availability, and affordability of our expanding, all-natural, EXCELERITE®                                                 and Micro-EXCELERITE® product lines.    WHAT IS EXCELERITE?                                                                  Excelerite® originates from a geo-thermal active "caldera", or volcanic crater region, which over millions of years, first as an ocean bed and later as a lake                                                                 bed, collected, trapped, and  filtered an incredibly rich ancient variety of essential minerals and micro and macronutrients.                                                               The mineral and nutrient compounds that comprise EXCELERITE® have a multi-century reputation for being remarkably supportive of human, animal and                                                                agricultural health. From the time that Indians inhabited Nevada, select portions of this rare earth have been the source of story lore about powerful healing                                                                abilities. In fact, it is often told that when pioneers were traveling through Nevada and settling the west, their mules would literally pull off from the wagon                                                                train to paw at and eat from the dirt, which delivered restorative results that were apparently stunning.         Today, through the vision of company founders, Paul Hait and Dennis Cullison, the dedication of their growing management team, and seasoned input from      an Advisory Board of industry, science, and business experts, the power of this gift of nature called EXCELERITE® is becoming available across a diverse  and rapidly expanding product line in every U.S. state and a growing number of major markets throughout the world.           Essential minerals and nutrients, such as those found in Excelerite® products, have been reported to dramatically improve the productivity of soils, the yield          of crops, and the well being    of animals and people. When analyzing Excelerite®, multiple labs in the United States have reported a spectrum of essential  dietary minerals and range of micro and macro nutrients statistically rare and highly prized in the remineralization industry worldwide.    See Their Customer Testimonials Here: http://youtu.be/O90uJMP8NDg  See How Rare Earth Mineral Stocks fare in the Stock Market Today: http://youtu.be/6zjzjyBKpr8          52wk Range: 0.02 - 0.16   Avg Vol (3m): 53,728   Market Cap: 7.15M       Share Statistics   Avg Vol (3 month)3: 53,728   Avg Vol (10 day)3: 55,983   Shares Outstanding5: 119.16M   Float: 76.18M   % Held by Insiders1: 36.17%

	of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes
	and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements due to numerous factors,
	including, but not limited to, those discussed in the “Risk Factors” section in Item 1A, “Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and elsewhere in this Report as
	well as those discussed from time to time in the Company’s other Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports.
	In addition, such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions. Such forward-looking statements speak
	only as of the date of this Report or, in the case of any document incorporated by reference, the date of that document, and we
	do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this
	Report. If we update or correct one or more forward-looking statements, investors and others should not conclude that we will
	make additional updates or corrections with respect to other forward-looking statements.

	Overview






	 




	U.S.
	Rare Earth Minerals (formerly U.S. Natural Nutrients and Minerals, Inc.) (the “Company”), was organized on June 9,
	2008. The Company changed its name in April, 2011. The Company’s focus is on sales and distribution of certain products
	derived from the Company’s mining activities relating to natural mineral deposits commonly known as Calcium Montmorillonite.
	These activities are currently carried out through a distributor-based sales program directed at agricultural and human uses of
	the product.  The Company commenced its mining activities in 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with M Strata LLC,
	a related party, whereby M Strata granted the Company permission and consent to mine certain mining claims owned or controlled
	by M Strata located on land located in the southwestern part of southern Nevada not far from the town of Panaca A copy of the
	First Amended and Restated Mining Agreement (the “M Strata Agreement”) effective as of November 1, 2013 was filed
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission in late 2013 on Form 8-K.




	 




	The
	Company has commenced a sales and marketing program and has been selling the product extracted in the mining process under the
	name “Excelerite®”.  The Company believes that Excelerite® may have broad applications for plants, animals
	and humans.  Specifically, the Company believes that by adding Excelerite® back into the soil, household and commercial
	farmers are replacing what has been lost by the use of man-made fertilizers over hundreds of years. Farmers using Excelerite®
	are seeing higher yields and larger and more nutritious crops. In addition, studies suggest that animals whose feed is supplemented
	with Excelerite® grow healthier and produce more. The naturally chelated nutrients and minerals in Excelerite® may enhance
	the production of enzymes. Without enzymes living things cannot build protein and other vital processes.




	 




	The
	Company markets Excelerite® through various channels including but not limited to direct distribution, sales through third-party
	distributors and sales on the Company’s website.  The Company has also undertaken to develop a network of distributors,
	both in the United States and internationally.

	Securities
	Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans






	 




	On
	January 19, 2010, the Company established a 2010 Employee, Director and Consultant Stock Plan

	 

	(the “2010 Plan”).
	The 2010 Plan was approved by the Company’s board of directors and by the consent of the shareholders owning a majority
	of the outstanding shares.  The material features of the 2010 Plan are described below.




	 






	Administration






	 




	A
	designated Administrator, or in the absence of such, our Board of Directors’ Compensation Committee or both, in the sole
	discretion of our Board, administers the 2010 Plan, which was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on January 19,
	2010. The Board, subject to the provisions of the 2010 Plan, has the authority to determine and designate officers, employees,
	directors and consultants to whom awards shall be made and the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to each award (including,
	but not limited to, the option price, any restriction or limitation, any vesting schedule or acceleration thereof, and any forfeiture
	restrictions). The Board may, in its sole discretion, accelerate the vesting of awards. The Board of Directors must approve all
	grants of Options and Stock Awards issued to our officers or directors.




	 






	Types
	of Awards






	 




	The
	2010 Plan is designed to enable us to offer certain officers, employees, directors and consultants of us and our subsidiaries
	equity interests in us and other incentive awards in order to attract, retain and reward such individuals and to strengthen the
	mutuality of interests between such individuals and our stockholders.  In furtherance of this purpose, the 2010 Plan
	contains provisions for granting incentive and non-statutory stock options, stock wards and stock appreciation rights.

	Stock
	Options

	. A "stock option" is a contractual right to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock at a price determined
	on the date the option is granted. The option price per share of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of a stock option and
	the time or times at which such options shall be exercisable shall be determined by the Board at the time of grant. Such option
	price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. The option price must be
	paid in cash, money order, check or Common Stock of the Company.  The Options may also contain at the time of grant,
	at the discretion of the Board, certain other cashless exercise provisions.




	 




	Options
	shall be exercisable at the times and subject to the conditions determined by the Board at the date of grant, but no option may
	be exercisable more than ten years after the date it is granted. If the Optionee ceases to be an employee of our company for any
	reason other than death, any option granted as an Incentive Stock Option exercisable on the date of the termination of employment
	may be exercised for a period of thirty days or until the expiration of the stated term of the option, whichever period is shorter.
	In the event of the Optionee’s death, any granted Incentive Stock Option exercisable at the date of death may be exercised
	by the legal heirs of the Optionee from the date of death until the expiration of the stated term of the option or six months
	from the date of death, whichever event first occurs.  In the event of disability of the Optionee, any granted Incentive
	Stock Options shall expire on the stated date that the Option would otherwise have expired or 12 months from the date of disability,
	whichever event first occurs.  The termination and other provisions of a non-statutory stock option shall be fixed by
	the Board of Directors at the date of grant of each respective option.




	 





	Common
	Stock Award

	. “Common Stock Award” is shares of Common Stock that will be issued to a recipient at the end of a
	restriction period, if any, specified by the Board if he or she continues to be an employee, director or consultant of us. If
	the recipient remains an employee, director or consultant at the end of the restriction period, the applicable restrictions will
	lapse and we will issue a stock certificate representing such shares of Common Stock to the participant. If the recipient ceases
	to be an employee, director or consultant of us for any reason (including death, disability or retirement) before the end of the
	restriction period unless otherwise determined by the Board, the restricted stock award will be terminated.




	 






	Eligibility






	 




	The
	Company’s officers, employees, directors and consultants of U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. are eligible to be granted stock
	options, and Common Stock Awards.  Eligibility shall be determined by the Board; however, all Options and Stock Awards
	granted to officers and directors must be approved by the Board.




	 






	Termination
	or Amendment of the 2010 Plan






	 




	The
	Board may at any time amend, discontinue, or terminate all or any part of the 2010 Plan, provided, however, that unless otherwise
	required by law, the rights of a participant may not be impaired without his or her consent, and provided that we will seek the
	approval of our stockholders for any amendment if such approval is necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state securities
	laws or rules or regulations.




	 






	Awards






	 




	For
	the calendar years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, no awards had been made under the 2010 Plan to pay for services rendered
	to the Company in lieu of cash. These awards are made when the Company does not have sufficient cash to pay for the services provided
	to the Company.




	 






	Shares
	Subject to the 2010 Plan






	 




	Subject
	to adjustment, the aggregate number of shares of Stock which may be delivered under the 2010 Plan shall not exceed a number equal
	to 15% of the total number of shares of Stock outstanding immediately following the Effective Time, assuming for this purpose
	the conversion into Stock of all outstanding securities that are convertible by their terms (directly or indirectly) into Stock

	; 

	provided,
	however, that, as of January 1 of each calendar year, commencing with the year 2011, the maximum number of shares of Stock
	which may be delivered under the 2010 Plan shall automatically increase by a number sufficient to cause the number of shares of
	Stock covered by the 2010 Plan to equal 15% of the total number of shares of Stock then outstanding, assuming for this purpose
	the conversion into Stock of all outstanding securities that are convertible by their terms (directly or indirectly) into Stock

	.

	Federal
	Tax Consequences





	 




	The
	Federal income tax discussion set forth below is intended for general information only. State and local income tax consequences
	are not discussed, and may vary from locality to locality.




	 





	Incentive
	Stock Options.

	  Incentive stock options granted under the 2010 Plan are designed to qualify for the special tax
	treatment for incentive stock options provided for in the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).  Under the
	provisions of the Code, an optionee who at all times from the date of grant until three months before the date of exercise is
	an employee of the Company, and who holds the shares of Common Stock obtained upon exercise of his incentive stock option for
	two years after the date of grant and one year after exercise, will recognize no taxable income on either the grant or exercise
	of such option and will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale of the shares.  If such shares are held by the optionee
	for the required holding period, the Company will not be entitled to any tax deduction with respect to the grant or exercise of
	the option.  If such shares are sold by the optionee prior to the expiration of the holding periods described above,
	the optionee will recognize ordinary income upon such disposition.  Upon the exercise of an incentive stock option,
	the optionee will incur an item of tax preference equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise
	over the exercise price, which may subject the optionee to the alternative minimum tax.




	 





	Non-Qualified
	Options

	. Under present Treasury regulations, an optionee who is granted a non-qualified option will not realize taxable income
	at the time the option is granted. In general, an optionee will be subject to tax for the year of exercise on an amount of ordinary
	income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the option price, and the Company
	will receive a corresponding deduction. Income tax withholding requirements apply upon exercise. The optionee's basis in the shares
	so acquired will be equal to the option price plus the amount of ordinary income upon which he is taxed. Upon subsequent disposition
	of the shares, the optionee will realize capital gain or loss, long-term or short-term, depending upon the length of time the
	shares are held after the option is exercised.




	 





	Common
	Stock Awards.

	 Recipients of shares of restricted Common Stock that are not "transferable" and are subject to
	"substantial risk of forfeiture" at the time of grant will not be subject to Federal income taxes until lapse or release
	of the restrictions on the shares. The recipient's income and the Company's deduction will be equal to the fair market value of
	the shares on the date of lapse or release of such restrictions. It has been the Company’s policy to value the cost of the
	issuance of said unregistered shares at the then bid price of the stock when issued.




	 




	The
	issuance of any of our common or preferred stock is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, which has the power to issue
	any or all of our authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval.






	 








	Recent
	Sales of Unregistered Securities






	 



	During 2016, 18,850,000 unregistered restricted
	shares were issued for cash consideration, payment for goods and services and compensation to the Board of Directors. On November
	29, 2016 3,000,000 of these shares were cancelled and on February 15, 2017, those shares were returned to the Treasury.

	OTHER
	INFORMATION







	 





	On
	October 26, 2009, U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. (USMN) (formerly known as U.S. Natural Nutrients and Minerals, Inc., a Nevada
	corporation (entered into an Agreement with M Strata, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company and related party (“M Strata”)
	(“M Strata Agreement”), whereby M Strata granted to USMN permission and consent to mine the certain mineral products
	(the “Product”) from certain mining claims owned or controlled by M Strata located in Panaca, Nevada.  Pursuant
	to the terms of the M Strata Agreement, M Strata designated which claims may be mined and USMN had the right to mine the Product
	and remove the Product from the mining claims so designated.




	 




	The
	M Strata Agreement further provided that it was granting USMN the exclusive right to mine and purchase the Product from M Strata
	(“Exclusive Right”) and M Strata agreed that it will not sell Product or permit any other person or entity to purchase
	Product or mine on the claims controlled by M Strata other than USMN, on condition that USNNM meets certain Purchase Minimums
	(as defined in the agreement) (“Purchase Minimums”) and makes timely payments therefor.  In the event USMN fails
	to meet the Purchase Minimums for a period of one year, then such Exclusive Right shall terminate and M Strata shall be entitled
	to either (i) terminate the M Strata Agreement and cause USMN to terminate all mining operations on M Strata’s claims or
	(ii) sell Product to other purchasers in addition to USMN.   USMN may cure any default in the Purchase Minimum by paying
	for the difference between the amount actually purchased in any one calendar year which was less than the Purchase Minimum and
	the amount actually ordered and paid for. Nothing in the M Strata Agreement conferred on USMN or its agents any rights of ownership
	in any mining claims owned or controlled by M Strata now or in the future.  In addition, USMN agreed that it would only purchase
	Calcium Montmorillonite (“Product”) from M Strata and from no other source for the term of the M Strata Agreement
	or any extensions thereof.




	 




	The
	initial term of the M Strata Agreement was for five (5) years and there was a provision for automatic extensions of the term for
	consecutive additional one (1) year terms thereafter.  The M Strata Agreement provided for payments by USMN of $24.00 per
	ton of Product removed from M Strata’s claims, subject to periodic adjustment for cost of living in accordance with the
	terms of the M Strata Agreement.  Payments for Product were to be made by USNNM to M Strata on a monthly basis, upon presentation
	of invoices and in accordance with the terms of the M Strata Agreement. There were monthly minimum purchases of Product that were
	required to be made during the term of the M Strata Agreement dated October 26, 2009. M Strata has agreed in the past to accept
	unregistered shares of common stock of USMN in consideration for the obligations of the Company pursuant to the terms of the M
	Strata Agreement.




	 




	A
	copy of the Agreement was attached to the filing of a Form 8-K in November, 2009.




	 




	The
	Agreement was supplemented in 2011 to include the right of the Company to mine various rare earth minerals on the mining claims.




	 




	On
	December 9, 2013, the Company and M Strata renegotiated the M Strata Agreement dated October 26, 2009. The Company and M Strata
	entered into the First Amended and Restated Mining Agreement effective as of November 1, 2013 (Amended M Strata Agreement). The
	Amended M Strata Agreement relieved the Company of its contractual obligation to purchase a minimum annual amount of 40,000 tons
	of product. The amended M Strata Agreement, amends and substantially modifies the terms of the October 26, 2009 Agreement. At
	the time of the execution of the Amended M Strata Agreement, the Company owed M Strata $606.000 for Product. As part of the agreements
	between the Company and M Strata, M Strata agreed to accept 400,000 shares of $1, 6% Cumulative Preferred Stock in satisfaction
	of $400,000 of the Company’s obligation to it and to cancel the remaining $206,000 of the amount owed.




	 







	 



	5



	 







	 





	 




	Management
	believes the Amended Agreement is of significant and substantial benefit and value to the Company because it eliminates the requirement
	that the Company purchase a minimum of 40,000 tons of Product per year (whether or not it was able to sell such amount in each
	year or not) at the current price calculated pursuant to the October 26, 2009 Agreement of a total of $1,080,000. Under the terms
	of the Amended M Strata Agreement, that minimum purchase requirement has been eliminated. Under the Amended M Strata Agreement,
	the Company is only required to pay for Product according to the greater of either (i) a minimum of one hundred tons a week at
	a price of $27 per ton (a minimum amount of $2,700 per week) or (ii) the actual amount of tons sold multiplied by $27 per ton.
	Accordingly, the Amended Agreement no longer obligates the Company to purchase a minimum of thousands of tons per year. The Amended
	Agreement contains additional modifications and provisions, which include, but are not limited to the following:




	 





	 



	a.




	The $27 per ton price will be subject to adjustment
	based on an annual price adjustment equal to the increase in the cost of living;





	 



	b.




	Payment of the greater of the minimum or the actual
	amounts must be made weekly;





	 



	c.



	All mining costs and fees payable to all government
	agencies shall continue to be paid by the

	Company;





	 



	d.




	All insurance requirements remain the same; and,





	 



	e.




	The term of the Amended M Strata Agreement has been
	extended for an initial term of 5 years and the Company has the option to extend the term for an additional 5 years so long as
	it is not in default under any of its obligations at the time of the exercise of the extension.






	 




	A
	copy of the Agreement was attached to the filing of a Form 8K on December 9, 2013.




	 




	On
	September 1, 2016 the Company moved it’s executive office from 4631 Bradford Court, Reno, Nevada 89519 to 23 South 6

	th

	,
	Panaca, NV 89042.

	an offering of shares of common and preferred stock to be designated by the Company.  There is no guarantee that this offering
	will be completed, and if completed, the specific terms and conditions.  We do not have immediate plans to have a public
	offering of our common stock and there is no guarantee that any such offering would be successful or be completed on terms which
	are beneficial to the Company.

	CRITICAL
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES




	 




	In
	presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein. Several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate
	to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events. However, events that are outside of our control cannot
	be predicted and, as such, they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions. If there is a significant
	unfavorable change to current conditions, it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations,
	financial position and liquidity. We believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements
	were the most appropriate at that time. Presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex
	judgments that could potentially affect reported results. However, the majority of our business operates in environments where
	we pay a fee for a service performed, and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our
	financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective, nor complex.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes”.
	Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and
	(ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s
	financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
	to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on the
	deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes
	the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the
	available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
	realized.




	 




	ASC
	Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements
	and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a
	tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification,
	interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We have no material uncertain tax positions
	for any of the reporting periods presented.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition







	 






	The
	Company purchases Calcium Montmorillonite Clay pursuant to an agreement with a related party, who owns the land and mine containing
	such clay, and resells the product for agricultural uses. Revenue from the sale of product obtained from our mining contractor
	is recognized when ownership passes to the purchaser at which time the following conditions are met:




	 




	i)
	persuasive evidence that an agreement exists;




	ii)
	the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the purchaser including delivery of the product;




	iii)

	Stock
	Based Compensation





	 




	Stock
	based compensation is accounted for using the Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employee Topic of the FASB ASC, which establishes standards
	for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses
	transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s
	equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. We determine the value of stock issued
	at the date of grant. We also determine at the date of grant the value of stock at fair market value or the value of services
	rendered (based on contract or otherwise) whichever is more readily determinable.




	 




	Stock
	based compensation for employees is account for using the Stock Based Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC.  We use the fair
	value method for equity instruments granted to employees and will use the Black Scholes model for measuring the fair value of
	options, if issued. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the
	performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods.




	 






	Going
	Concern






	 




	The
	Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a
	going concern.  This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
	 Currently, the Company does not have significant cash or other material assets, nor does it have operations or a source
	of revenues sufficient to cover its operational costs and allow it to continue as a going concern.  




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate
	continuation of the Company as a going concern.  As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded
	its current assets by $315,302 and it has an accumulated deficit of $13,882,800. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.  These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
	to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result
	from this uncertainty. We will need to raise funds or implement our business plan to continue operations. 



	 



	In
	order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s
	plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient
	to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances
	that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.




	 




	The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
	in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.





	 







	Balance
	Sheet Arrangements








	 






	We
	do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
	resources that is material to investors.




	 






	Contractual
	Obligations






	 




	The
	Company has a contractual obligation pursuant to the M Strata Agreement. See Item 5 above.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
	ACCOUNTING FIRM



	 


	To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of U.S. Rare Earth Minerals,
	Inc.


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
	of U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2016, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’
	equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
	Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.


	 


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the
	standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and
	perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The
	Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our
	audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate
	in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
	financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
	by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred
	to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. as of December 31,
	2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally
	accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company
	has negative working capital and has generated minimal revenues. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
	from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	U.S.
	Rare Earth Minerals, Inc.

	Vegas, Nevada




	 




	We
	have audited the accompanying balance sheet of U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. as of December 31, 2015 and the related statements
	of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit) and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the
	responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
	our audit.




	 




	We
	conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
	misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
	reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures
	that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's

	that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.




	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. will continue as a going concern.
	As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company’s income has come from two major clients and there can be
	no assurance that there will be a continuance in their business, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue
	as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to this matter are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not
	include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Company requires payment before release of product to preclude uncollectible receivables. If terms are granted to an established
	customer and their receivables are open one year past the due date, these open invoices will be reviewed to determine if they
	should be charged off at the year end. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015 no balances were charged off.




	 





	Inventories





	 




	Inventories
	are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first-in, first out (FIFO) method. As of December 31, 2016, all inventory
	consisted of finished goods.




	 





	Fixed
	Assets





	 




	The
	Company records fixed assets at cost and calculates depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life
	of the assets, which is estimated to be between five and seven years. Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense
	when incurred. Replacements and major renewals are capitalized.




	 




	At
	December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the value of mining equipment was $280,834, with accumulated depreciation of $256,950
	and $231,102 respectively for a net value of $23,884 and $49,733 respectively. The value of office equipment was $10,239 with
	accumulated depreciation of $9,416 and $7,636 respectively for a net value of $823 and $2,603 respectively. At December 31, 2016
	and December 31, 2015, the depreciation expense for mining equipment was $25,998 and $52,756 respectively and for office equipment
	was $1,630 and $2,024 respectively.

	Shipping
	and Handling Costs





	 




	The
	Company charges the customer for shipping and handling and those costs are recorded as cost of sales.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes”.
	Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and
	(ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s
	financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
	to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on the
	deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes
	the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the
	available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
	realized.




	 




	ASC
	Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial
	statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
	measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on
	de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We have no
	material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented.




	 





	Revenue
	Recognition







	 






	The
	Company purchases Calcium Montmorillonite Clay pursuant to an agreement with a party, who owns the land and mine containing such
	clay, and resells the product for agricultural uses. Revenue from the sale of product obtained from our mining contractor is recognized
	when ownership passes to the purchaser at which time the following conditions are met:




	 




	i)
	persuasive evidence that an agreement exists;




	ii)
	the risks and rewards of ownership pass to the purchaser including delivery of the product;




	iii)
	the selling price is fixed and determinable; or,




	iv)
	collectively is reasonably assured.




	 





	Stock
	Based Compensation





	 




	Stock
	based compensation is accounted for using the Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employee Topic of the FASB ASC, which establishes standards
	for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. It also addresses
	transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods or services that are based on the fair value of the entity’s
	equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of those equity instruments. We determine the value of stock issued
	at the date of grant. We also determine at the date of grant the value of stock at fair market value or the value of services
	rendered (based on contract or otherwise) whichever is more readily determinable.




	 




	Stock
	based compensation for employees is account for using the Stock Based Compensation Topic of the FASB ASC.  We use the fair
	value method for equity instruments granted to employees and will use the Black Scholes model for measuring the fair value of
	options, if issued. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the
	performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the vesting periods.

	Fair
	Value Measurements





	 




	We
	adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, “Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”, which defines fair value as used
	in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.
	The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
	payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term
	nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because
	the effective yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest rates taken together with other features such as
	concurrent issuances of warrants and/or embedded conversion options, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar
	credit risk.




	 




	ASC
	820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
	in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
	on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
	inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may
	be used to measure fair value:




	 




	Level
	1 — quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities




	Level
	2 — quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable




	Level
	3 — inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	From
	time to time new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies
	that may have an impact on the Company’s accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting
	pronouncements and other authoritative guidance for which the effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its accounting
	or reporting or that such impact will not be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows when implemented.




	 





	NOTE
	3. GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate
	continuation of the Company as a going concern. To date, the Company has generated minimal revenue and has an accumulated deficit
	of $13,882,800 and a working capital deficiency of $315,302 as of December 31, 2016. These factors, among others, raise substantial
	doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
	relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that
	might result from this uncertainty. We will need to raise funds or implement our business plan to continue operations.




	 




	In
	order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s
	plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses by seeking
	equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing
	any of its plans.




	 




	The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon, among other things, its ability to successfully accomplish
	the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually begin operations in accordance with its business plan. The accompanying
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

	shares are callable by the Company at any time after three (3) years from date of issue at $1.00 plus accrued but unpaid interest
	unless previously converted.

	Management’s
	Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control
	over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a
	process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and
	effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding
	the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:



	 







	●




	Pertain
	to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect
	the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;






	 








	●




	Provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
	of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
	the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
	made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
	and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
	acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material
	effect on the financial statements.






	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria
	for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued
	by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and SEC guidance on conducting such
	assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and
	procedures were not effective.



	 




	Management’s
	Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	 




	We
	maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
	filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

	,

	as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
	time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
	including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
	In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognizes that any controls and procedures,
	no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and
	our management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore,
	even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation
	and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
	inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	As
	required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report,
	being December 31, 2016, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our company’s
	disclosure controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our company’s
	management, including our company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation,
	our company’s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our company’s disclosure
	controls and procedures are not effective due to the material weaknesses described below. There have been no changes in our internal
	controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are
	reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.




	 




	Disclosure
	controls and procedures and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports
	filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
	period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
	without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
	under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to management including our Principal Executive Officer,
	to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	in internal controls over financial reporting




	 



	There

	the functions that would otherwise be handled by an audit committee. We do not currently have the capital resources to pay director
	fees to a qualified independent expert who would be willing to serve on our board and who would be willing to act as an audit
	committee financial expert. As our business expands and as we appoint others to our board of directors we expect that we will
	seek a qualified independent expert to become a member of our board of directors. Before retaining any such expert our board would
	make a determination as to whether such person is independent.

	AUDIT
	FEES




	 




	The
	aggregate fees billed by our auditors, Heaton & Company, PLLC and MaloneBailey LLP, for professional services rendered for
	the audit of our annual financial statements for fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and review of our interim financial statements
	for the first, second and third quarters of 2016 is approximately $24,000. The aggregate fees billed by our auditors, MaloneBailey
	LLP, for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements for fiscal year ended December 31, 2015
	and review of our interim financial statements for the first, second and third quarters of 2015 was approximately $39,500. 




	 











	 



	15



	 







	 





	 




	AUDIT-RELATED
	FEES




	 




	During
	the last two fiscal years, no fees were billed or incurred for assurance or related services by our auditors that were reasonably
	related to the audit or review of financial statements reported above.




	 




	TAX
	FEES




	 




	Tax
	preparation fees billed for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $800 and $750,
	respectively.




	 




	ALL
	OTHER FEES




	 




	During
	the last two fiscal years, no other fees were billed or incurred for services by our auditors other than the fees noted above.
	Our board, acting as an audit committee, deemed the fees charged to be compatible with maintenance of the independence of our
	auditors.



	 



	THE
	BOARD OF DIRECTORS PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES




	 




	We
	do not have a separate audit committee. Our full board of directors performs the functions of an audit committee. Before an independent
	auditor is engaged by us to render audit or non-audit services, our board of directors pre-approves the engagement. Board of directors
	pre-approval of audit and non-audit services will not be required if the engagement for the services is entered into pursuant
	to pre-approval policies and procedures established by our board of directors regarding our engagement of the independent auditor,
	provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, our board of directors is informed of each service
	provided, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of our board of directors' responsibilities under the Exchange
	Act to our management. Our board of directors may delegate to one or more designated members of our board of directors the authority
	to grant pre-approvals, provided such approvals are presented to the board of directors at a subsequent meeting. If our board
	of directors elects to establish pre-approval policies and procedures regarding non-audit services, the board of directors must
	be informed of each non-audit service provided by the independent auditor. Board of directors pre-approval of non-audit services,
	other than review and attest services, also will not be required if such services fall within available exceptions established
	by the SEC. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, 100% of audit-related services, tax services and other services performed
	by our independent auditors were pre-approved by our board of directors.




	 




	Our
	board has considered whether the services described above under the caption "All Other Fees", which are currently none,
	is compatible with maintaining the auditor's independence.




	 




	The
	board approved all fees described above.

                American Elements’ Silver says he met top Trump deputies
            



                ‘The staff understood the urgency of the matter,’ he says

The head of an advanced-materials manufacturer said he met with President Donald Trump’s chief strategist, Steve Bannon, on Monday to persuade him that the U.S. should nationalize the country’s only mine of rare earth minerals, which are used in military applications.“The staff understood the urgency of the matter,” Michael Silver, chief executive officer of closely held American Elements Corp., said in a phone interview after his White House meeting, which he said was also attended by presidential deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus.The rare-earth mining operations in Mountain Pass, California, the last remaining assets of bankrupt Molycorp Inc., were bought in June by a group that drew objections from rival bidders, who said the winner has ties to the Chinese government.








The mine should be converted to a national laboratory “dedicated to rebuilding America’s rare-earth mining industry so the world knows it is safe to build high-tech manufacturing plants in the U.S.,” Silver said.The production of rare-earth minerals -- used in applications from hybrid electric cars to iPhones and military hardware such as night-vision goggles and guided weapons -- is dominated by low-cost Chinese companies. Molycorp Minerals and its parent, Molycorp Inc., filed for bankruptcy in 2015 after prices for the minerals fell below the mine’s costs to produce them.Silver said he was invited to brief the president on the issue on Tuesday. The White House didn’t respond to requests for comment.




Eminent DomainSilver said he’s proposing the U.S. government apply the Takings Clause of the 5th Amendment and acquire Mountain Pass by eminent domain.Any attempt to make the mine commercially viable would fail because no one can compete with China, which accounts for almost all the world’s rare-earth production, Silver said.




“The perception is the only place in the world you can go for reasonably priced rare earth materials for your product is in China,” he said. “You have to change that perception.”

Los Angeles-based American Elements manufactures metals and chemicals and has a catalog of more than 15,000 products, according to its website. Silver said his company did business with Molycorp before its Mountain Pass became idle. Silver was among the first Americans to set up a production and distribution supply chain from rare earth mines in Inner Mongolia and China to North America and Europe, according to documents on the company website.Creditor FeudThe sale of Molycorp’s last remaining assets to one of two groups of creditors that had feuded over the facility was approved after complaints that the winning bidder, which is majority-owned by JHL Capital Group LLC and QVT Financial LP, had recruited an affiliate of Shenghe Resources Holding Co., which allegedly is tied to the Chinese government.The Chinese mining company, Leshan Shenghe Rare Earth Co., owns nearly 10 percent of the business that took over the mine and mineral rights, MP Mine Operations LLC, according to court records. Leshan’s stake doesn’t give it voting rights, MP Mine said in the filing.JHL Capital founder James Litinsky, who has been helping lead the effort to revive the mine, declined to comment.Efforts to reopen Mountain Pass have been hampered by a two-year fight for control of the assets between a group of low-ranking noteholders, led by JHL, and distressed debt giant Oaktree Capital Management LP.Molycorp went into bankruptcy while trying to perfect an advanced, experimental ore processing system that cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Oaktree provided the loans that funded that system and got ownership of it under a compromise in bankruptcy court that split up the company’s assets. Oaktree owns the most advanced ore-processing equipment at the mine, while JHL and QVT control the most important mineral rights at the site.— With assistance by Jennifer Epstein

Excelerite® gets to the root of agriculture problems.



Healthier Planet – Healthier People

World health and agriculture science sources have noted an alarming decline in the nutrient density of the world’s produce over the past 40 years. At the very same time, leading nutritional researchers are targeting dietary nutrient and mineral deficiencies as likely contributors to an epidemic of unprecedented health disorders worldwide. The fact is that an extremely high percentage of our world’s agricultural top-soils that have not already been lost to erosion have become dangerously depleted of their original minerals and micro-nutrients. These natural complexes are essential to optimal soil fertility and sustainable productivity. Clearly, this is a global problem requiring a global solution.
Rare deposits of rich mineral complexes in their natural forms do exist. However, they are rarely as commercially available and in as potent of a form as EXCELERITE®. Further, most humans, plants and animals in our ever-expanding world population centers do not enjoy easy and affordable access to these resources. And of no less concern is the mounting toxification of the world’s soils that are now experiencing the devastating effects of excess artificial fertilization. Through runoff, precious waterways, lakes, and oceans are also impacted. These conditions are destroying the balance of our ecosystem.
However, there is good news at hand. Leading agronomists, especially those focused on the emerging soil sciences of “bio-remediation” and “sustainable agriculture,” have discovered that the process of restoring the natural health, richness, and productivity to the world’s agricultural soils can be greatly aided through remineralization. By making a pure, rich, and highly assimilable source of Mother Nature’s own natural mineral and micro-nutrient complexes available worldwide at affordable prices, the leadership, distributors, and shareholders of U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc. contribute daily to this important emerging market and global mission.


The Genesis of Excelerite®

Excelerite® originates from a geo-thermal active “caldera”, or volcanic crater region, which over millions of years, first began as an ocean bed and later as a lake bed, collected, trapped, and filtered an incredibly rich ancient variety of essential minerals and micro and macronutrients.
The mineral and nutrient compounds that comprise EXCELERITE® have a multi-century reputation for being remarkably supportive of human, animal and agricultural health. From the time that Indians inhabited Nevada, select portions of this rare earth have been the source of story lore about powerful healing abilities. In fact, it is often told that when pioneers were traveling through Nevada and settling the west, their mules would literally pull off from the wagon train to paw at and eat from the dirt, which delivered restorative results that were apparently stunning.
Today, through the vision and dedication of the evolving management team utilizing the seasoned input from an Advisory Board of industry, science, and business experts, the power of this gift of nature called EXCELERITE® is being distributed in every U. S. state and a growing number of major markets worldwide

A rare earth cooperative for critical minerals could be just what America needs

China is by far the world’s leading producer and exporter of minerals and metals. The nation also is proving increasingly expert at using its mineral resources to influence geopolitics. Even those minerals and metals that are mined outside China find their way there via the world’s most sophisticated supply-chain networks – all according to the design of Beijing’s leaders.By contrast, the United States is 100 percent import-reliant on more than 20 key minerals and metals essential both to a healthy economy and our national security. Most of these are partially, if not totally supplied by China, which enjoys near complete market power over the all-important rare earth parts industry.Rare earth elements (REEs) are essential components of modern, high-tech electronic equipment. Notably, REEs enable the high-tech magnets used in everything from iPhones to joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs), from the white-noise-concealment stealth technology used for helicopter rotors to ship and aircraft motors. REEs are found in every computer, flat screen, guidance system, directed energy weapon and laser, among many more critical technologies. In short, REEs are indispensable to our economy and national defense.China's monopoly of the global REE market should be no surprise. Almost 30 years ago, Deng Xiaoping boldly stated, “The Middle East has its oil, China has rare earth.” From then until now, China steadily has increased its rare earth dominance to roughly 97 percent of the market, using a combination of overproduction and price manipulation to drive out competitors. Because Western scientific efforts have thus far failed to develop new reliable, cost-effective REE substitutes, companies that need access tend to relocate to China. China also has used its REE monopoly as a geopolitical bludgeon. Since the 1990s, Chinese authorities have pursued an explicit policy of controlling a resource they considered “strategic and critical.” China’s manipulation of the global supply of REEs received heightened attention in 2010, when they halted REE exports to Japan in response to a fishing dispute near a set of islands claimed by both countries.U.S. domestic resource extraction offers no real solution, at least in the short term. Though the country is home to REE ores, the United States lacks the manufacturing chain to turn those ores into useable parts. Building a mine domestically takes upward of a decade, thanks to permitting and infrastructure issues. Domestic industry also would have to contend with China’s manipulation of the global supply chain. U.S. rare earth producers have tried to compete and been bankrupted in the past, including the biggest rare earth miner—Molycorp in 2015. Thus, a pressing question for the administration is how to address this reliance on China, a strategic competitor, to obtain what are critical and strategically important materials.We propose forming a U.S.-based, privately funded and managed rare earth cooperative—comprising companies that require rare earths to manufacture magnets, electronics, alloys and rare earth metals—that would focus on turning REE ores into useable parts. A co-op would enable end users to act together, without violating antitrust law, to procure finished REE products that currently are available only from China. This value chain could provide a market for the United States' vast available REE resources, without being undercut by the Chinese monopoly.Cooperatives have long been an American solution to market failures. For example, new-generation cooperatives (NGC), developed in the 1990s in California and the Midwest, are tailored specifically for use by modern capital-intensive industries that add value to primary products, such as those involved in the production of ethanol from corn. A rare earth co-op would function similarly by developing a domestic rare earth supply chain by and for the benefit of downstream American manufacturers and our allies.Co-op members could be granted a federal “charter,” which would demonstrate a national commitment to overcome China’s dominance of the rare earth market, but without direct government involvement. A co-op model has the potential to redirect the flow of capital, jobs and technology related to the rare earth industry away from China and toward a reliable domestic solution—a highly desirable goal for this totally import-dependent group of minerals.China can hardly be blamed for its clever use of global mineral resources. Decades of unsustainable U.S. mineral resource policies have contributed mightily to our present state of dependence. If a rare earth cooperative proves as successful as other American co-ops, not only would it alleviate rare earth supply problems, but it could represent a template for domestic production of other critical minerals on which the United States is entirely or almost entirely import-dependent.The Trump administration has pledged its commitment to embark on a massive infrastructure rebuilding program. Minerals and metals are the backbone of the nation’s infrastructure. With our national security at stake, the time to form a rare earth cooperative is now. Bold and resourceful action to create a domestic REE value chain can mitigate the national security risks of Chinese dominance of the rare earth market, while creating American capital and jobs.Dr. Ned Mamula is a geoscientist and associate fellow at the nonprofit R Street Institute in Washington, D.C. Brig.

Honeybees and Agriculture – U.S. Rare Earth Minerals, Inc

































































  















Honeybees and Agriculture

The unexplained rise in honeybee deaths – mainly due to high winter losses in honeybee colonies in the EU, and ‘Colony Collapse Disorder’ (CCD) in the USA – has become an issue of great concern. As honeybees are one of the most important pollinators for wild plants and crops, they are closely linked to both agriculture and biodiversity.
Since 1961, there has been a 45 percent rise in the managed honeybee population worldwide. Nonetheless, in recent years a number of beekeepers have experienced serious bee losses in Europe, the US and elsewhere.
In the USA adult bees have been disappearing from colonies since 2006; abandoning their queen, their brood, and their food reserves in what has been termed ‘Colony Collapse Disorder’ (CCD).
In contrast, a number of European beekeepers have witnessed unusually high bee colony losses during winter since the 1990s. Reliable surveys have estimated colony losses of 5 to 35 percent in the period 2002 to 2010, with a peak over the 2002/03 winter. Losses of around 10 percent would previously have been considered normal.
Separately, there have been occasional reports of bee poisoning, caused by the mismanagement of crop protection products.
A variety of interlinked factors are potentially to blame
There is a growing belief that interacting factors, including parasites, diseases, nutrition, beekeeping practices, weather patterns and genetics may be challenging the survival of bees.
Parasites and viruses can spread easily in today’s highly connected world. Both Varroa destructor (a parasitic mite and vector of viruses) and Nosema spp. (a parasitic fungus) weaken immunity and bee health. As a result, many viruses – previously known to cause no symptoms of ill-health in bees – have become fatal.
The limited genetic diversity of honeybees – bred from a limited number of lines to become less aggressive and more productive – may also affect immunity. For example, it is estimated that the entire honeybee population of the USA can be traced to 500 queens.
Modern farming has also reduced the variety of pollens within the agricultural landscape, impacting bee diet and also immunity. New stresses have been created by the bees’ changing environment as commercial pollination requires beekeepers to transport hives over long distances to foreign environments while confined in close proximity to each other.
Climate change can be considered as another factor, bringing harsher winters and wetter springs to Europe. Young bees that survive these conditions often have impaired health.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
