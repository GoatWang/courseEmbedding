Former Roper Technologies and Danaher Corporation executive brings 
      operations, product innovation and strategic expertise






December 02, 2015 08:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



AKRON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Myers Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MYE) announced today that its Board of 
      Directors unanimously elected R. David Banyard as the Company’s next 
      President and Chief Executive Officer, effective December 7, 2015, 
      succeeding John C. Orr. Mr. Banyard will also be elected to the Board of 
      Directors of Myers Industries, effective January 1, 2016. Mr. Orr was 
      named Vice Chairman until his retirement from the Company and as a 
      director on December 31, 2015. He will work with Mr. Banyard during this 
      period to provide an orderly and efficient transition.
    


      Myers’ Chairman of the Board, Robert “Yank” Heisler said, “The Board of 
      Directors is delighted to welcome Dave Banyard to Myers Industries. We 
      undertook a comprehensive CEO search, and the Board believes that Dave 
      fits both the leadership characteristics and the industry experience we 
      sought to succeed John Orr. His strong track record at both Roper 
      Technologies and Danaher Corporation brings significant expertise and 
      experience to Myers."
    

      “I look forward to joining Myers and working with the management team 
      and Board of Directors,” said Mr. Banyard. “I believe that the 
      re-focused Material Handling and Distribution operating segments have 
      attractive prospects for growth and value creation, and I am pleased to 
      have the opportunity to lead these businesses to their next level of 
      success.”
    

      Commenting on John Orr’s leadership during the past decade, Mr. Heisler 
      said, “John has overseen Myers’ transformation to a more streamlined, 
      focused industrial company, and guided us through many challenging times 
      in his ten years as CEO. His leadership has positioned our company as a 
      value added manufacturer with strong positions in the agricultural, 
      industrial and automotive market segments. We wish him well in his 
      retirement and thank him for his dedicated service since becoming CEO in 
      2005.”
    

      A 1990 graduate of Princeton and, later, The University of Virginia 
      Darden School of Business, Mr. Banyard directed his post-education 
      career to the U.S. Navy as a fighter pilot. Mr. Banyard began his 
      business career with Danaher Corporation and held successive leadership 
      roles during his six year tenure culminating with his leadership of the 
      Vehicle Systems business unit of Kollmorgen, based in Stockholm, Sweden. 
      Mr. Banyard subsequently joined Roper Technologies in 2010 as the Group 
      President, Fluid Handling Technologies where he led a diverse portfolio 
      of companies serving a wide array of end markets. Mr. Banyard has a 
      proven track record of outperforming market growth while delivering 
      expanded profit margins, reducing working capital requirements and 
      driving improved cash flow performance.
    

      Mr. Banyard and his wife, Diane, will be moving with their three 
      children to Northeast Ohio in early 2016.
