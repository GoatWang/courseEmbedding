The Power of Imagery in Content Marketing - Sigstr

        The Power of Imagery in Content Marketing      

        Published by Brad Beutler on July 20, 2016      





Back to Blog





A picture is worth a thousand words, so the saying goes. While us marketers love a good infographic or chart, the saying holds true in almost every context. In a recent article on JeffBullas.com, author Savannah Louie says “words aren’t enough any more.” And we agree with her! In fact, 27,000,000 pieces of content are shared each day, according to an Aol & Nielsen content sharing study. Wow, that’s a TON of content consumers have access to view. How do they decide what to dig into and what to skip? 
As marketers, we need to be increasingly more and more intentional about standing out from the crowd. While words can be incredibly powerful, we need to capture the attention of our followers in new, graphic-centric ways that give us an edge. The article authored by Savannah goes on to say that, “With the increase of photo, video, infographics and screenshots – today’s marketers are discovering the power behind imagery in content marketing.”
Why Images Are King in Content
“Communication coupled with imagery – photographs or video – is easier to process and more entertaining than words on a blank canvas,” says Savannah. Forbes Insight reports that nearly 60% of senior executives prefer to watch video instead of reading text, if both are available on the same page.
Still skeptical? Check out these interesting stats from an Inc. article:

The average person gets distracted in 8 seconds, though a mere 2.8 seconds is enough to distract some people
People form a first impression in a mere 50 milliseconds
An estimated 84 percent of communications will be visual by 2018
An estimated 79 percent of internet traffic will be video content by 2018
Posts that include images produce 650 percent higher engagement than text-only posts
People are 85 percent more likely to buy a product after viewing a product video
Posts with videos attract 3X more links than text-only posts

An infographic in AdWeek shared that: 
“People remember 80% of what they see or do, versus 20% of what they read. Imagery in content marketing is a “must” if marketers want to make a lasting impression on consumers.”
3 Tips to Creating Powerful Visual Content
In Savannah’s article, she points out 3 tips to make content more powerful using visuals:
1. Pick the right type of content
“Stock photos may be an easy way to add a visual element to a blog post, but there are better ways to execute visual marketing,” said Savannah. “Adding an infographic or a short video outlining key points can make content much more meaningful to the consumer.”
“However, if your hands are tied and you’re at a loss for original images, using a relevant stock photo is better than completely foregoing a visual element. Reports show that 40% of people respond better to text coupled with visuals than plain text. Although stock photos may not be ideal or original, these images will garner more attention than no visuals at all.”

2. Make a call-to-action
Savannah also shares that, “Visual marketing can be an asset because of its ability to inspire consumers to take action. Marketers should ensure that they are taking advantage of this capability by including a call-to-action (CTA) with their visual marketing.”
“Not all CTA’s have to be obvious. By drafting creative, stimulating content, consumers will feel compelled to share your work with others. By simply providing a solid piece of imagery, you can inspire your audience to advocate for you without actually having to ask.”
3. Be aware of omnichannel marketing
“You can tweet the best video content with links to landing pages on your website… But if your site is not optimized for mobile, this means nothing to the consumer trying to access your site from their smartphone,” commented Savannah.
“Consumers should be able to access all touch points of your company without a hitch. Encountering an incorrectly linked landing page or receiving conflicting messages across two separate platforms can be a major turnoff for consumers. Ensure that you are producing seamless content with omnichannel marketing to avoid confusing or frustrating customers.”
The Power of Imagery in Employee Email
Want another opportunity for your marketing and content to cut through the noise? Your employees send thousands of emails every single day, each with an opportunity to be visually appealing. Use Sigstr for your html email signatures so company branding is consistent, and employee email becomes an owned channel for marketing and employee communications.
Easily add clickable call-to-action banners to your html email signatures. After initial setup, these banners update automatically across your entire organization anytime a new campaign is activated.
Sigstr’s email signature generator allows your employees to use the power of imagery in html email signatures. For marketers, that means promoting the newest piece of content, an upcoming webinar or important event, or a company initiative in a visually compelling way that’s displayed with every single employee email sent.
Need Some "Sigspiration"? (see what we did there?)
Check out a few of our favorite examples below.

I realized today as I had a few users using non-Gmail email options that the password requirements were 12 characters but you couldn't see the characters as they typed. With 12 characters they kept messing it up and the confirmation one didn't match. I tweeted @ them and within hours they had not only replied to my feedback but actually MADE THE CHANGE!!! I love these guys. They are SO on top of things and are constantly improving their product and they are an absolute joy to work with.  After 20+ inquires about "what should our signatures look like?" from employees around our company I knew it was time for a solution. Sigstr saves me time so I can focus on important marketing initiatives instead of jumping into everyone's email accounts to help craft a consistent signature! I think my favorite part is that it syncs SO well with Google Apps/GSuite. It's been so damn easy to get started and get people going with our new...What do you dislike?It's a little slow to load sometimes but I'm a super fast user so I'm not surprised by that. I also am having trouble finding a way to get it consistent for all my mobile users with Gmail on an Android. Recommendations to others considering the productIt's SO worth the low cost to have this amazing, time saving, branding solution! Their support team is seriously the best I've ever worked with and they are constantly making improvements. They actually take feedback seriously and use it!What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Oh man - first we just saved ourselves a ton of time. Also, we're able to keep our branding consistent. Finally, we've already started getting registrations for our next webinar from the campaign in our signature and it's been live for less than a week!!Read MoreShare on50 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as SigstrReport a ConcernDrew B.Review SourceDrew B.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceExtremely Simple and High-ImpactUpdated On December 22, 2016Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?As a marketer, I love having the ability to control our brand across all our email signatures to ensure brand consistency. It has also unlocked a brand new channel for us to promote high-impact, real-time campaigns. What do you dislike?While Sigstr has made great strides in their analytics, that would be the one area for greatest improvement. I know they have plans to continue to make their analytics world-class. The analytics they do provide, though, are still far beyond anything you have had for 1:1 employee email in the past. Recommendations to others considering the productIf you are in sales, marketing, HR, or customer success, Sigstr feels like a no-brainer. It's an extremely low barrier to entry, so I highly recommend. Especially with their new Dynamic Campaigns feature, I'm able to personalize campaigns based on recipient and get the right content to the right audience at the right time.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Sigstr solves for brand consistency across our email signatures and an easy way to promote new content via an owned media channel. It's driven a number of inbound leads and brand awareness for the content we're already developing.

I ran into Sigstr at the Salesloft event last year and loved the concept.  We started using them a month later and I no longer have to worry about what our team's email signature looks like or what links they present.  We now have not only consistency of content, but also messaging.  But wait, there's more...  The messaging can be broken down into groups so the sales message can be different than the support message.  What do you dislike?Nothing that I can think of, this is really sound software.

A former Salesforce.com executive is assuming the top job at Sigstr Inc., the Indianapolis-based email-marketing company announced Tuesday.
Bryan Wade
Bryan Wade, who spent more than a decade at ExactTarget and Salesforce in Indianapolis, is set to become CEO of Sigstr on April 10. His last day at Salesforce was Feb. 28. Sigstr founder and CEO Dan Hanrahan will remain with the company as president, focusing his energy on partnerships and enterprise sales.
The passing of the reins comes as Sigstr, a High Alpha portfolio company that has 270 clients and 25 employees, nears its third year in business. Hanrahan said that after a bit of reflecting last November about his strengths and the potential for Sigstr, he began speaking with board members about landing a new chief executive with experience scaling companies.
"Before I even considered Bryan, it just dawned on me that 'Hey, man, I can do what I love and what I'm best at if I can find the right leader who's really product-driven and has been where we're going.'"
He later added: "There are only a few people in the world I'd trust with Sigstr. It means the world to me ... and I trust Bryan to get us where we're all committed to going."
Sigstr's software allows companies to control marketing messages beneath email signature lines. The firm says its customers, including Angie’s List, United Way and the Indiana Pacers, use its clickable banners to promote key events, case studies, product updates, job opportunities and internal communications.
Wade, 40, graduated from Ball State University in 1998 and joined ExactTarget in 2005. He spent time in customer service, sales and product marketing, culminating with the role of chief product officer of Salesforce Marketing Cloud after Salesforce acquired ExactTarget in 2013.
Hanrahan said Wade has considerable clout and wide name recognition in the marketing-tech world. Wade said he chose Sigstr partly because its software can be used by just about every company. His goal, he said, is "to put Sigstr on the map.”
"Every business in the world runs a corporate email system and every business in the world could use Sigstr," Wade said. "Marketers are always looking for new channels and new ways to reach customers."
Hanrahan, a former ExactTarget employee, began working on Sigstr in summer 2014. About a year later, local venture studio High Alpha announced that it was adopting Sigstr as a portfolio company, a designation that came with a $500,000 investment and in-house expertise with everything from pricing to hiring.
Last June, Sigstr announced plans to add 111 new jobs to a baseline of 15 by the end of 2020 in exchange for $1 million in conditional state tax credits.
Today, Hanrahan said, the company has 25 employees, up from eight in early 2016. And it grew annual revenue 450 percent between 2015 and 2016, he said. Hanrahan wouldn't disclose the company's annual revenue, but acknowledged that it's in the seven-figure range.

								How will Sigstr improve the efficiency of our business?
							




							The prime purpose behind investing in the software solution is to boost efficiency and growth. Ask the software vendor (Sigstr Inc) how their business app would improve efficiency of your enterprise.
						







								How can we do better with Sigstr?
							




							Software vendors have tremendous exposure to different companies. They offer the same type of software to different industries, so they are better aware of who is doing what with their technological product. This also helps them understand and foresee what’s really working. Allow them to share their observations so that you get an ideas about their experience, expertise, and intelligence. This will also be an opportunity to identify the service providers who come up with the most insightful suggestions.
						







								Is Sigstr scalable?
							




						Perhaps your business is growing and will expand in the future. So you would be interested to know if the software is scalable and can grow with you. It’s no use investing in a solution that can be scaled.
						







								Is Sigstr customizable?
							




						Each business has different needs. Yours is no different. When it comes to selecting a software solution, you are looking for a tool that can be easily customized and configured to cater to your specific business needs. So you want to understand if the software you want to buy is easy to customize.
						







								Can I get access to a community forum for current users of Sigstr?
							




						Such a community forum is the best way to engage users. Getting access to software forums can help new or proposed users connect with product experts through peer-to-peer discussions.
						







								What is the best way to measure the return on investment that your software promises to provide?
							




						The software vendor should answer how their business software will improve your bottom line and ROI.Most service providers make tall claims, so you want to make sure you get your hands on the best solution.
						







								Who will handle the implementation process?
							




							Before choosing a business app, you want to understand that the implementation would be smooth. So you should be interested to find out about the person responsible for handling the implementation process. Do not hesitate to ask about their qualifications..
						







								What is the software vendor's expertise in the implementation?
							




							A good software vendor should be able to show you a positive track record with their implementation strategy.Try to find out if their method is structured. Your purpose should be to look for one that is structured and flexible to adapt to unexpected situations
						







								How smooth will the data migration be?
							




						The software  vendor should give you a structured data conversion methodology that will enable smooth migration of your information to the new system.
						







								Does Sigstr Inc provide an API for integrating 3rd party apps?
							




							A growing business is always in need for expansion and  integration with thrid-party apps is a part of the growth model. When it comes to choosing software, make sure the business app provides an application programming interface for easy integration. 
						







								How easy it is to import and export data to and from Sigstr?
							




						Ask the software product vendor if the tool will allow you to export data to an external file or import data from external sources.
						







								Are there any consulting hours available as part of the software package?
							




						Ask the software vendor (Sigstr Inc) if the software package includes consulting hours. Do not hesitate to ask if there are any hidden charges involved.
						







								What will it cost if the software vendor (Sigstr Inc) sends a technician on-site to solve a problem concerning our business?
							




						You do not want to be caught unawares when a software vendor sends a technician to resolve an issue that may crop up due to varied reasons. You want to make sure the charges are reasonable. Better still, you should be aware of what needs to be paid to the technician sent by the vendor to fix a problem.
						







								What are the minimum hardware requirements to install, implement, and run the software program on the server? 
							




						You do not want to fall in love with the front end unless you are 100% sure that the software is compatible with your existing system. Ask the software vendor is you need any specific hardware to install the software. Will the business application run on your existing workstations. How much space will the software take on the disk drive? Is there a need for RAM upgrade to successfully run the software for optimum performance?
						







								Does Sigstr Inc charge per location or per terminal?
							




						You should enquire about the cost of having more than one terminal in your store. While some software vendors charge on the basis of the number of store locations, others charge per terminal. 
						







								Is there any startup or maintenance fee involved?
							




							When you are looking for a software solution, make sure you know if the vendor charges any fee to get you started. You should also be interested to know if there are any software maintenance charges for you to pay.

								How does Sigstr Inc guarantee data backup?
							




						Data loss can prove extremely risky for any business. So you should always ask the vendor about their backup policy. How often is data backed up and what is the cost for the same?
						







								Does the software vendor provide free disaster recovery support in the event of a catastrophic hardware failure?
							




						What is the software vendor's policy on disaster recovery? Are any charges involved for disaster recovery support if a catastrophic hardware failure affects your system?
						







								Is Sigstr easy to use?
							




							How easy is the software to work on? Is it user friendly for your end users? Does it involve any complexities that are difficult to understand for the team? Even a feature-rich solution is of no use if end users find it difficult to use.
						







								How much training is required in the software to get your team up to speed?
							




							The software provider should clearly mention whether the solution is complex or simple to use. If it is not an easy-to-use software solution, then do they provide training? What is the level of training your team requires to make the most of the solution?
						







								How often is the software updated?
							




							You will be interested to know about the software updates. When is it updated? Does the service provider notify customers when the upgrades are scheduled? Does the software work when the upgrades are under way? How long does the process take?
						







								Who will answer our calls when there is an issue with the software performance?
							




							You should be interested to enquire about how an issue is handled at the side of the software vendor. Do not hesitate to question about who will respond to your emergency calls. What is their experience in software industry?
						







								How vast is the software vendor's client base?
							




							If the software vendor is widely popular, chances are that they have a good product. So always check their client base to measure their product's competence in the market.
						







								How does Sigstr Inc performs testing and validation?
							




							Testing is crucial to ensuring that the software runs as promised. So you should try to find out if the vendor offers any free trial runs or try before you buy the product. By testing the concept first, it gets easier to understand the software product's functionality and allay fears before signing a contract.

Next to ROI, marketing conversion rate will more likely be the main focus of a well-versed modern-day internet marketer. Marketing is communicating the value of a product or service to a customer with the goal in mind of selling that same product or service.

There is more to learn on this scientific body knowledge and one of them is the acquisition process of the right marketing software solution for your business.
 
Types
Marketing software solutions are here for these two important tasks: 1) conduct customer/market segmentation and 2) campaign development and management. With this principle in mind, marketing leads us into these three major types of marketing solutions.
 
Marketing Intelligence
By tracking the customers’ response on marketing campaigns conducted via different channels, marketing software solution is able to gather and measure data from these activities. This helps marketer in developing better programs and campaigns that can boost market conversion rate.
 
Marketing Automation

Features
Most marketing software solutions rooted out from Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and Email Marketing industries. Let’s go over with this list of features that will help you better understand the power of available marketing software solutions today.
 
Database
Database supports every feature and function of a marketing platform. It is where contact data and activity histories for each lead and customer are saved and secured.
 
Email Marketing Engine
Considered as the hardest working marketing tool, automated email campaigns can produce conversion rates two times higher than non-automated ones.
 
Automated Programs
Lead nurturing programs like series of follow-up messages and scheduled call-to-action alerts helps improve lead-to-customer conversion process.
 
Lead Scoring

Solutions per Business Size, per Vendor
