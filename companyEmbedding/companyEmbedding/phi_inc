Phi Software Inc - Products






















Phi Software Inc
ProductsPhi Software Inc is committed to the development of products which extend and enhance Hawk’s capabilities and provide our customers with the additional tools they need to address their business critical monitoring requirements.  Our growing product line currently includes: AgentEvents Captures and records agent events at the agent level. It maintains a configurable number of days’ worth of alerts in local storage. Allows you to query and view the historical events using the standard Hawk display eliminating the need to login to other systems or launch other applications to view alert history. Maintenance Mode MicroagentAllows you to place an agent into a maintenance mode (aka blackout periods) during which monitoring activity is suppressed. It supports fully configurable maintenance mode policies and all maintenance mode activity can be monitored using standard rulebases. Example use case: The administrators need to perform an emergency maintenance operation on a database during which they do not want the agent to report on database related problems or attempt to restart the database. By placing the agent or one of its rulebases into maintenance mode for a limited time, the alerts and corrective actions are suppressed without the need to manually alter the agent’s configuration or stop the agent. Command MapperCommand Mapper provides a rich integration facility for scripts and custom executables. Customized microagents can be rapidly assembled out of a set of mapped scripts which may return either complex or tabular data for processing by the agent’s standard rules engine. It is also very useful for training, testing, and rapid prototyping of management interfaces for application instrumentation.  Logfile PlusLogfile Plus adds multi-line monitoring and pattern frequency monitoring to the agent’s native log file monitoring capabilities. Detection of some application problems requires correlation across multiple lines of a log file. Other problems have a log file signature that is identified by the frequency of some error message. Logfile Plus provides these capabilities with the ability to configure the number of lines over which correlation can occur and per-pattern frequency intervals.  A-RepoA-Repo addresses an issue faced by nearly all large scale Hawk implementations: The problem of rulebase management. The ease with which one can create, modify, and deploy rulebases with Hawk can also lead to inconsistencies if strict change control procedures are not followed.  A-Repo effectively serves as a comprehensive monitor of your monitoring configuration. It insures that your agents are indeed monitoring what you think they should be monitoring; no more and no less. It tracks rulebase versions and identifies inconsistencies. It can be used interactively or with standard Hawk rulebases to generate alerts when inconsistencies arise. Phi Enhanced Console (EC)EC provides extensions to the standard TIBCO Hawk Console API. It adds several useful features and event types for use by console applications including:Multi-Domain Access – Monitors multiple Hawk domains from a single application.Reachability – Checks IP connectivity for dead agents eliminating the need for ping probes.Known Agents – Provides both static and dynamic mechanisms for specifying which hosts to track or ignore. Supports include/exclude lists and a configurable agent-memory feature.Console-Side Maintenance Mode – Tracks agent-side maintenance mode events and implements console-side maintenance mode functionality. Global Event LoggerGlobal Event Logger is an EC-based event service that centrally persist all standard and EC events for future reference. It supports all EC features including: Multi-Domain Monitoring, Reachability, Known Agents, and Maintenance Mode.

About Us
With over 40 years of experience in aesthetic product development and pharmaceutical manufacturing, the PHI, Inc. team understands what aesthetic professionals and their patients are looking for… top quality products that meet their needs at a fair price.
Established in 1999 in Chesapeake, VA, as a niche product company, PHI’s employees pride themselves in operating with integrity, being intuitive and providing creative solutions to the aesthetic market.

Founder and CEO Dennis R. Jones has worked and created products in various facets of the aesthetic market and believes that keeping the client’s needs as the company’s focus is the way to be successful. “We don’t just sell products; we find needs and try to fill them with unique and effective products. That is the only way to do business.”
Of course, PHI was first known for Meladine™, the only patented natural melanin enhancer. Used to increase pigment in non-pigmented hair follicles for treatment by laser, Meladine™ has become a tremendous success across the U.S. and beyond. Thanks to this little product, people with blonde, gray and white hair are receiving satisfying results with laser hair removal—a feat that has not been accomplished with any laser alone. Meladine™ has a track record of over 1,000 U.S. based laser hair removal centers to prove its efficacy.
Now, we are proud to introduce our new products; Zcaine™ and Zcalm™.
Zcaine™ is a non prescription (OTC) pain relief gel, which contains 4% Lidocaine, to help relieve pain of minor burns and skin irritations, minor cuts and scrapes and minor itching.
Zcalm™, with its proprietary blend of calming botanicals and rejuvenating ProElements™, has proven to be a unique and welcomed addition for post-laser treated skin.
Watch for more superior and innovative products from PHI. PHI is dedicated to providing its clients with top-quality, dependable products.

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
