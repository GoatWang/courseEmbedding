Short Bio

 I was born in China and got my Bachelor
              degree in Mathematics
              from  University of
              Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2004. In
              2008 I obtained my Ph.D. from Department of
              Statistical Science
              at Duke
              University. 
	      My Ph.D. advisor is Professor Mike
              West . In 2007 I did a summer internship at
              Yahoo! Labs with
              Dr. Deepak
              Agarwal. I worked at Yahoo! Labs as a scientist from
              August
              2008 to March 2012. Now I work at LinkedIn as a Sr. Staff
              applied researcher.  See my
              LinkedIn page for more details.
              









Summary 
 I have broad interests in applying Bayesian
              statistical modeling to web applications. My
              Ph.D research focuses on graphical models and model
              selection for high-dimensional problems. While at Yahoo! Labs, I have worked on several different web application
              areas, including recommender systems, content
              optimization, web fraud detection, computational
	      advertising and so forth. After I moved to LinkedIn in 2012, I spent around 2 years leading the scientific work for the relevance of ads and sponsored updates, especially, response prediction. These efforts have significantly improved performance metrics for the two products, e.g. CTR and revenue. I am currently serving as a technical lead of the LinkedIn relevance team (around 180 people) that tackles all the relevance and data related problems at LinkedIn, e.g. homepage feed personalization, site speed data science, email optimization, jobs recommendation, anomaly detection and so forth.
