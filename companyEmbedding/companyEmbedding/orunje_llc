Get the wheels turning for a healthy summer...
by Pardeep Athwal MD, MBA




Exercising can at times feel like a daunting chore. In the midst of work, soccer practice, dinner and weekend obligations, how does one find time to keep physically fit? This was the question I asked myself a few months ago and soon after, I stumbled into a local area bike shop. After a few test rides and questions by the knowledgeable staff, I was the proud owner of a shiny new hybrid. Unbeknown to me at the time, this purchase would change my summer in more ways than I could imagine, all without sacrificing a significant amount of time. Here are a few of the positives of partaking in what I like to call "enjoyable exercise".
Rediscover your city...
I used to drive everywhere, even places that were a few miles away. Once I received my bike, I decided to cycle to these places and quickly learned that the city I live in began coming alive. Buildings, parks and gardens were now significantly more noticeable to me. Instead of driving past them quickly in my car, I was now marveling at the intricate designs on these centuries' old buildings, the beautiful blossoms of flowers and people strolling down the sidewalks. Whether your walking, running or biking, you will be able to get outdoors, bathe your skin with a healthy dose of vitamin D and cause increased release of "feel good" neurotransmitters. This has an immensely positive impact on your overall well-being and mood. So hop on a bike or your feet to take advantage of a variety of health benefits while seeing your city in an entirely new way!
Doing things you normally do anyways with the added benefit of burning calories and boosting energy...
My commute to work is a 10-minute drive, mostly because I hit several traffic lights on the way. I decided one day to bike to work, something I had never done before. I added 5 minutes to my commute, which was now 15 minutes; however, it was far more enjoyable and less stressful than driving. Also, my round-trip commute allotted me 30 minutes of exercise, without interfering with my normal schedule. A mild to moderate paced bike ride burns 281 calories per hour and a light jog/brisk walk burns the same amount of calories in about 45 minutes. In addition to burning calories, moderate exercise increases energy levels, which studies show equate to increased productivity at work, particularly in the mornings. How does this happen...? Physical activity increases oxygen and nutrient delivery to your tissues and helps your body pump blood more efficiently, which bathes your tissues with much needed energy packed nutrients and molecules. This has a direct positive impact on energy levels. So if your work commute is short, instead of driving to work hop on a bike or put on your sneakers and take a brisk walk, which will give you jolt of energy while burning calories and making your morning commute far more enjoyable.
Relieve stress, get fit and ward of chronic illnesses...
Decades of research has time and time again demonstrated the benefits of exercise. From weight control to decreased incidence of chronic health conditions, moderate daily exercise goes a long way in helping you live a long and healthy life. In particular, regular exercise boosts high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is what we doctors refer to as "good" cholesterol. This significantly decreases your risk of cardiovascular disease and helps to reduce stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer. Now let me ask you a question, do you ever get into work in the morning and notice your mood isn't the best? Well, let me be the first to tell you that exercise stimulates neurotransmitter release, as mentioned above, which helps you to feel happier and more relaxed. Your morning slump may become a thing of the past and furthermore your confidence and self-esteem will improve as you feel better about your physical appearance. Lastly, all of this can be done while increasing time you spend with your nature or your family. So whether you're walking, jogging or riding your bike with a family of 6, get up, get out and advantage of time in the outdoors.
To sum it all up...
I hope sharing my personal experience with you helped to shed light on how a small purchase significantly impacted my overall well-being and mood. We all feel at times that there are not enough hours in the day to accomplish the important tasks we have set out to do, let alone spend an hour in the gym cycling in place or running on a treadmill. Incorporating exercise into your daily schedule will allow you to get the much-needed physical activity without cutting into your busy life. And as research shows, moderate exercise (30 minutes or more) can significantly impact your energy levels, mood and overall health in countless ways. Lastly, here are some of our favorite walking/jogging and biking trails around Chicago. So stop looking for excuses, get up, get out and get going and make the world your playground.

A Puff of Truth about Smoking
by Rushim Bains MD




Walking around Chicago, I still see a lot of people smoking.  We have had clean air laws on the books for years now, but the reality is that people are still hooked on this habit.  It may or may not be the case that people are aware just how harmful this habit truly is, but it's time to shed some light on the effect smoking has on our health.
Most people know that smoking is bad for you, and causes lung cancer.   But there has been decades of data and studies that show a lot more than just that.  Smoking is actually the leading preventable cause of mortality, leading to 6 million deaths worldwide and 400,000 deaths in the US alone per year.  A study in Norway showed that for people who smoke more than 20 cigarettes per day, years of life lost were 1.4 years in women and 2.7 years in men.  Smoking is also implicated in 33% of all cardiovascular deaths in the United States.  Think about that, 1/3 of all heart related deaths in the US are attributable to this preventable habit!
Smoking is also strongly correlated with many other conditions, such as COPD (emphysema), tuberculosis, various forms of pneumonia, influenza, and the common cold.  The number of cigarettes smoked daily has also been linked to an increased risk of developing diabetes in the long term.  Smoking also accelerates bone loss, leading to osteoporosis and the increased risk of hip fracture in women.  It is also linked to complications during pregnancy, premature menopause, erectile dysfunction in men, and infertility in both sexes.  Other conditions linked with smoking include ulcers of the stomach, periodontal disease, and gingivitis.
So, you may ask, what about cancer?  Well, everybody knows smoking is one of the major causes of lung cancer.  But we have discovered that many more cancers are strongly linked with smoking.  Those include, but aren't limited to, colorectal, head and neck, kidney, liver, pancreatic, penis, stomach, cervical, breast, and nasal cancers.  Leukemia (a blood cancer) and another type of lung cancer called mesothelioma are linked with smoking as well.  Ever see those commercials from lawyers advertising whether you developed mesothelioma from working with asbestos or at a ship yard?  Well just remember, smoking is still a more common cause of that disease than any other factor.
Is the damage already done if we've spent years smoking?  Yes, but there is good news:  smoking cessation is very beneficial.  Studies show mortality benefits of quitting smoking at all ages, but the benefits are even greater for those who quit before the age of 40.  Quitting smoking also reduces the risk of developing cancer and the accelerated decline of lung function that causes COPD.  But you have to quit smoking completely, as studies so far have failed to show that only partial reductions in smoking lead to mortality benefits.  So if you're down to half a pack a day then kudos to you, but you really need to kick the habit entirely if you want the health benefits.
What about these new e-cigarettes, are they better than regular cigarettes? This is a difficult question to answer because e-cigarettes are relatively new and not enough research and data is available to quantify their long-term effects. The paucity of evidence however, does suggest that they may be somewhat safer, since they are smokeless, and it is cigarette smoke that causes the majority of damage to the lungs. But before you embrace this new trend, it's important to understand that these do still contain nicotine, the addictive drug that is found in all cigarettes, and it is nicotine that is related to some of the harmful effects of smoking and withdrawal symptoms. So if you are using these new devices or are considering the switch, remember not to utilize these excessively and keep a close eye on new research and news stories discussing the effects of e-cigarettes on your health.
What about the "side effects" of quitting smoking?  Sure, there are withdrawal symptoms from nicotine such as increased appetite, depressed mood, irritability, anxiety, and problems with concentration.  Also, people who quit smoking generally gain weight of roughly 4 to 5 kg over time.  People with a history of depression who quit smoking are more likely to trigger a depressive episode.  Yet despite this, the health benefits of quitting smoking far outweigh these factors.
So put out that cigarette and breathe some fresh air before you do too much damage to your body.  And you don't have to do this cold turkey-talk to your primary care doctor about strategies to help you quit, you need not be alone on this journey.

Daily preventative medicine
by Rajbeer Singh Sangha MD




We brush our teeth every night to maintain our oral hygiene, we shower on a daily basis, we do multiple basic tasks that help maintain our bodies however it is always surprising to me how few people who have hypertension, diabetes, or other common chronic medical conditions engage in daily preventative medicine.
What does daily preventative medicine mean? It means to monitor closely the parameters of your condition that may indicate it is being poorly controlled.  Having a blood pressure monitor, recording your diabetic fingersticks in a notebook and presenting it to a physician gives them a wealth of information that could not be otherwise found from all the eloquent and intricate testing we do.  When we get a blood pressure or a reading of your glucose from blood work we are only exposed to a snapshot of how the body may be doing; with a long term trend we can make a much more accurate assessment of the condition.  How can this information translate into better health? All your medications, diet modifications and exercise can be tweaked with this information and especially medications can be titrated to better improve your long-term control of this condition.  Recording your daily health habits does not only extend to your chronic medical conditions but can also be extended to your recording your daily food habits or the amount of steps you walk in a day.  Having information of your "normal" function can also help a physician ascertain the degree of decompensation you may be suffering from a particular condition.
Why is this important?  Well aside from your own well being there is also an economic benefit!  Studies have shown that a one percent reduction in weight, blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol risk factors would save $83 to $103 annually in medical costs per person.
While this information is valuable to a physician, it should never be used by a patient to change their own medications and the results should always be discussed with your doctor. This allows for the best improvements in your day to day diet, medications and exercise regimen.  A recent study by Kaiser Permanente's Center for Health Research showed that the simple act of keeping a food diary can double a person's weight loss.  Furthermore, researchers from this study noted that the task of keeping a daily journal does not need to be formal, rather utilizing a pen and paper you can keep a record of the day to day progress you have made.  The process of reflection not only helps us become aware of our habits but also leads to motivation in keeping up with the trend. 
The benefits of tightly controlling chronic medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes are numerous and include the prevention of renal failure, chronic heart disease, significant reduction in stroke risk, and even decreased probability of developing erectile dysfunction.  The possibility of developing such conditions should give any with these diseases a moment of pause if they are not actively monitoring their condition multiple times a week. 
Never underestimate the smallest measures as they cumulatively often lead to the greatest of difference. Lastly, we understand that some of you may be too busy to write down and track every little thing. Utilize some of these apps, which will make this task a whole lot easier and even enjoyable!

Cup O'Joy ...
I mean Joe
by Pardeep Athwal MD, MBA




For several decades, caffeine got a bad rap, primarily from a small subset of research articles published in the 70's and  80's. As a child, my mom would frequently tell me not to drink tea or coffee because it may stunt my growth, and on more than one occasion I've heard a patient tell me "they do no drugs, not even coffee". Let me be the first to tell you, incase you haven't heard, that new research suggests coffee is actually beneficial to your health in several ways. You can finally breathe a sigh of relief after taking a sip of your piping hot caffeinated cup of joy, that you are likely doing far more good than harm, if any.
A study of over 130,000 adults spanning 24 years demonstrated that even heavy coffee drinkers (48-ounces of coffee a day) demonstrated no increased risk of mortality and there was even some indication that these "regular" coffee drinkers had a lower rate of mortality than non-coffee drinkers. Furthermore, coffee has been linked to lower rates of type-2 diabetes, protection against some cancers, Parkinson's disease and depression.
So this all sounds great, but what is it in coffee that is so beneficial? It's a mix of several components that give coffee it's seemingly "super powers". Coffee is chalk full of antioxidants, which scour the body and neutralize potentially damaging things called free radicals. Free radicals can damage your cells and DNA, which overtime can lead to a multitude of illnesses and cancers. Caffeine works in the brain by blocking inhibitory neurotransmitters (adenosine), which increases the electrical activity in your brain improving mood, reaction time, memory and cognitive function. Lastly, caffeine increases your metabolism and increases the breakdown of fat in your body, which is beneficial for your well-being and physical appearance. This all sounds great, but this all sounds too good to be true...? As we have learned through our many personal experiences in life, moderation is key.
Coffee on it's own is nearly calorie free and has 0 grams of fat and sugar, however, not many people enjoy coffee without any condiments... And not to mention the lattes and other flavored beverages served up at our favorite coffee shops. The fat and sugar can quickly begin to add up and the negative effects can overtake the health benefits. In summary, coffee is finally beginning to get the positive attention it deserves, with an array of potential health benefits. Remember to keep moderation and limit what you add to your beverage. Lastly, we toast your cup of coffee as a healthy start to 2015 and remind you to put the toilet seat down if you're one of our male readers, as caffeine is a mild diuretic.

A Simple Cure
by Rajbeer Singh Sangha MD




The world of healthcare is rapidly evolving with new advances changing the landscape of medicine. Many patients query me during their visitations as to how they can become healthier in light of these advancements and discoveries. Such questions always cause me to pause and smile as they always get the same response, "strong, viable health comes from within." A rather cliched statement but one they don't expect to hear from a physician and one that causes a momentary puzzled look.
This statement simply alludes to the fact that most of medicine works to stabilize and give each individual the opportunity to pursue "whole-self" health. The term applies to a lifestyle of healthy diet and daily exercise. A recipe, which the American Heart Association also lists as a key ingredient to improving your overall well-being. The American Heart Association goes one step further and gives each individual dietary recommendations that reduce the risk of Alzheimer's, Ischemic Stroke and improves cardiovascular health. This diet recommendation has been analyzed and is supported by peer reviewed journals. As per the American Heart Association, current diet recommendations (in the broadest sense) are based on the Mediterranean diet.
The key components include:

Eating a diet primarily of plant based foods includingfruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts
Replacement of butter with healthy fats such as olive oil
Using herbs and spices to flavor food and decreasing the amount of salt
Limiting red meat to no more than a few times a month while eating fish and poultry to at least two times a week

Further details can be found at the American Heart.
Seems rather simplistic and straight forward doesn't it? Yet this simple diet once adopted can improve blood pressure, lower cholesterol, decrease oxidant stress, decrease risks of accelerated coronary artery disease and improve overall well being.
In terms of exercise, the recommendations from the American Heart Association include:
AHA Recommendation
For Overall Cardiovascular Health:
At least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity  aerobic activity at least 5 days per week for a total of 150 minutes.
OR
At least 25 minutes of vigorous  aerobic activity at least 3 days per week for a total of 75 minutes; or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity
AND
Moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days per week for additional health benefits.
For Lowering Blood Pressure and Cholesterol:
An average 40 minutes of moderate- to vigorous-intensity  aerobic activity 3 or 4 times per week
Once again this information is taken directly from the American Heart association's website www.heart.org, which can be accessed for further reference.
With the combination of a healthy diet and consistent exercise regimen, individuals will find significant improvements in their health and overall well-being. Even with medical advancements and the wide array of medications we have our disposal in 2015, simple diet and exercise modifications prove to be superior in preventing many illnesses and helping promote a long, active and happy life.

The Stomach Flu
by Rushim Bains MD




What is the stomach flu?  Unlike the name, it has nothing to do with the actual flu, or Influenza, that infects the respiratory system.  The stomach flu, or "Viral Gastroenteritis", is a virus infecting our gastrointestinal tract.
The most common cause of this disease is a virus called norovirus, with rotavirus being the second most common.  This disease peaks in the winter and spring seasons.
If you've ever had this illness you know the symptoms: diarrhea, fever, belly pain, and vomiting, although not all of these symptoms have to occur for you to have the disease.  Symptoms tend to last less than two weeks, and vomiting tends to precede the diarrhea.  Among people who present to the Emergency Room with this illness, the most common symptoms in descending order are nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.
From the time you are infected until you start having symptoms varies, but averages at 24 to 60 hours.  Rotavirus tends to last longer than norovirus.  If you are having bloody stools, diarrhea that lasts over a week with a recent history of travel, or were recently prescribed antibiotics, you may actually have another illness and should seek help from a medical professional.  Food poisoning tends to occur more quickly than stomach flu, with symptoms starting within 8 to 16 hours of consuming the infected food.
How do you deal with this illness?  The good news is, around 75% of the time it is self limited and will go away on its own.  In 25% of cases you may have some prolonged symptoms after the illness is resolved, requiring a temporary change in your dietary habits.
During the active illness, it is recommended that adults consume sports drinks and broths, in addition to water.  This is to help maintain your body's electrolyte levels.  Despite common practice, avoid soft drinks and juices that are high in sugar content as they can worsen your symptoms.  Also avoid dairy as many people develop temporary lactose intolerance while they are ill.  You are allowed to eat whatever you can tolerate, but most people tend to do well with crackers, yogurt, soups, and broiled starches such as potatoes, noodles, and rice.  There has been a lot of talk about probiotics but as of yet there isn't enough evidence to conclude that they help with the stomach flu.
For severe diarrhea adults under 65 can take over the counter loperamide, which is an antidiarrheal drug.  This medicine should be avoided if you develop constipation, a distended belly, or worsening belly pain.  It should also be avoided if you have bloody stools, as that may suggest you have a different diagnosis.
In most cases you can manage this disease at home, but in some situations people may need to be hospitalized.  Some of those include severe dehydration, inability to keep anything down, bloody diarrhea, severe belly pain, symptoms lasting more than a week, older age, pregnant patients, and people with many other health problems such as diabetes or those with a weakened immune system.
How do you prevent the stomach flu?  The virus is spread by direct hand to hand contact, so the best advice is to wash your hands for 15 minutes with soap or use a hand sanitizer after you have been in contact with an infected person.

About Us
OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM HAS OVER 40 YEARS OF HEALTHCARE EXPERIENCE AND POSSESS A RANGE OF KNOWLEDGE IN MULTIPLE DISCIPLINES OF MEDICINE AND ITS DELIVERY OF CARE. OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE CONVENIENT, COST EFFECTIVE HEALTHCARE TO ALL.

LEADERSHIP TEAM


CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CO-FOUNDER
PARDEEP ATHWAL MD, MBA

Dr. Athwal is a radiologist who has dedicated the last decade of his life to healthcare.  He has published numerous articles pertaining to multiple facets of medicine, and has presented his research at numerous national conferences.  During his training, Dr. Athwal decided to pursue a master's in business administration with an emphasis on healthcare leadership.  As he came to better understand the business of healthcare, he found a large disconnect between patients and physicians.  Since then, he has played an active role in many healthcare leadership societies and his ultimate goal with Orunje is to reshape the healthcare frontier. 


CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER AND CO-FOUNDER
RUSHIM BAINS MD

Dr. Bains has been practicing medicine for over 10 years, with extensive experience both on the inpatient and outpatient side.  Working mostly for large organizations, Dr. Bains has seen how the healthcare system in the United States today operates, and what its strengths and shortcomings are.  He has observed how bureaucracy and special interests have corrupted the doctor-patient relationship, and has made it his goal to create better options for both parties in the healthcare marketplace.  With Orunje, his main priority will be to seamlessly connect clients with the providers that can best serve their needs, making for a satisfying experience for both patients and physicians.

What does it mean to update a profile?





Owler is a community of business professionals working together to build a database of company information. One contribution reaches thousands of members across the Owler community.
When you contribute on Owler you're shaping the database for all people consuming Owler data. Your updates will flow through to company profiles, competitive intelligence reports, daily snapshots and more. All verified members of the Owler community can update Owler profiles.  Members help the community by sharing data, such as a company's headquarters, and also by weighing-in on sentiment-based questions, such as CEO rating.
Community members make this all happen. That being said, each data update is reviewed by at least one other person to ensure accuracy. All updates are kept anonymous. Happy updating!

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
