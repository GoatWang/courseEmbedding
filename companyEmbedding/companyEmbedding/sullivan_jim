About Us
Since 1985, Blessed Herbs has been in the business of caring for the health of our customers by offering premium herbal products. Over 30 years later, we are still here providing quality herbal supplements to herbalists, health professionals, herbal manufacturers, retailers and individuals in the United States and abroad.*
In 2001, we introduced a full line of herbal cleansing and health maintenance products. Today, many of our herbal cleansing kits, like our Internal Cleansing Kit¬ô and the Colon Cleansing Kit¬ô are routinely used by thousands of health practitioners and hundreds of thousands of individuals all over the world.*

Our Quality and Integrity
We take pride in our ability to consistently provide the very best quality herbal products available. We take strict measures to ensure the freshness, potency, and overall quality of our products. When it comes to herbs, we ensure that the raw plant material obtained for the herbal, liquid and cleansing formulas will be of the utmost quality and purity.*
At Blessed Herbs we truly care about your health and your satisfaction, that's why we offer a 1 year money back guarantee on all our products.*

Herbal Cleansing: Nature and You Working Together
In our modern society, it's easy to forget that we¬íre an integral part of nature; that our bodies are part of a holistic, living system that supports and nourishes us.*
When we're in good health, it's a sign we are not overworking our bodies. There is a balance between what is taking place within our bodies and without; that there is a balance.*
When we're feeling ill or "out of sorts" ¬ñ our bodies are sending us a signal that we are out of balance, that we are out of sync.*
Herbal cleansing is a way to "reset" our personal system and help our bodies regain balance. The herbal cleansing formulas we offer and dietary changes we suggest help the body expel accumulated waste and toxins*. But just as importantly, a natural body detox supports and encourages our body's own self-cleansing mechanisms ¬ñ our channels of elimination and detoxification themselves.
So while it may appear that these potent herbs may be doing all the work, they are really designed to help our body to work better. Each of us has six, inter-dependent channels of elimination, and when we get all those channels working together seamlessly, we feel healthy!*

Environmental Concerns
Environmental concerns for the plants themselves are very important. Some plants have been collected so extensively that their lives are threatened in the wild. There are even locations where the over-picking of herbs has completely eliminated some species. Wild Ginseng Root, Goldenseal Root, Lady Slipper Root, and False Unicorn are just a few of the plants that are in threat of being over harvested.*
When formulating products, ensure that we are not using herbs that are on the endangered list. We do our best to keep an eye of what is endangered so as not to contribute to the list of herbs that are being over harvested.*

Premium Herbal Quality Guaranteed
Our herbs come from vendors who make sure the raw material they offer is pure, of high quality and are actually what they say it is via DNA herbal testing.*
The secret to our success is maintaining open communication with our suppliers and manufacturers. This gives us a surety of the quality and integrity of the herbs they provide. This is not always easy, but we are determined to keep establishing better communications and relationships with everyone who supplies the herbs we buy.*
It's important to get the highest-grade herbs available. Herb quality makes a huge difference in results! A lot of products that have gotten into the marketplace over the last several years are of dubious origin. We provide only the highest quality possible and stand behind our herb quality.*

Knowledge is not the same as learning. Instruction imparts knowledge. But learning occurs only when knowledge is applied. The best measure of whether learning has occurred is action and results back on the job. Effective training is not knowing, effective training is doing. Confidence and competence are the twin goals of training. Integrate group discussion, shared experience, practice, feedback and real-world examples into your training curriculum to help bridge the knowing-to-doing gap. Skinny the monologue and fatten the dialogue.Previous Next  Tags   fundamentalshiringleadershipmanagementsystemsteamwork  share this post      Jim Sullivan   View all posts by Jim Sullivan  Related Products   The Renegade Cook  $21.95 $19.95   Culture That Rocks by Jim Knight  $27.95 $24.95   The 4 Disciplines of Execution: How to Achieve Your Wildly Important Goals  $29.95 $22.95   The Big Book of Creativity Games  $25.00 $19.95   Renegade Server Training Flash Drive  $499.00 $279.00  Explore TopicsCateringchecklistcontestscost controlcustomersdevelopmentelearningfree downloadfree plannerfundamentalsfuturehigh impact restaurant visithiringHIRVImproving Performanceincentivesjumpstartleadershioleadershipmanagementmarketingmultiunit leadershipmultiunit leadership checklistplannerpre-shift meetingProfitabilityretentionrewardsseasonalsellingServicesystemsteamsteamworktime managementtrainingturnoverRSS FeedsNation‚Äôs Restaurant NewsQSR MagazineRestaurant HospitalityQuick LinksCartCheckoutHomeMy AccountStoreFIND US ON        Contact InfoAbout UsCustomer ServicePrivacy and SecuritySite Map¬© Copyright 2014 Sullivision.com            QUICK SHOP

            COMMENTEMAILMORETed Williams ripped off his shirt without bothering with the buttons. The great Boston slugger was so steamed at striking out three times in a single game that he began plotting his revenge before leaving the locker room.‚ÄúHe walked over to the schedule on the wall, ran his finger down until he came to the next Detroit series,‚Äù recalled Gene Mauch, then a Red Sox infielder.Finding the date, Williams made a vow.‚ÄúBunning,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to get you then.‚ÄùSixty years since that Thursday afternoon at Fenway Park ‚Äì May 16, 1957 ‚Äì Jim Bunning is now a vivid memory, too. The Hall of Fame pitcher and U.S. Senator, accomplishments that appear here in order of their relative rarity, has died at age 85 as the only ballplayer to earn both induction in Cooperstown and¬†a seat in Congress.Related coverage‚ñ∫A look at Jim Bunning's perfect game in 1964
‚ñ∫Bunning inducted into Hall of Fame 21 years ago
‚ñ∫From October: Bunning recovering after strokeBefore he represented Kentucky in the House of Representatives and the Senate, Bunning was a baseball type lately out of production¬†‚Äì¬†a fiercely competitive, workhorse pitcher Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred remembered Saturday as being ‚Äúproud of always taking the ball.‚Äù He started three major-league All-Star Games,¬†won strikeout titles and threw no-hitters in both leagues (including a Father‚Äôs Day perfect game for the Philadelphia Phillies in 1964) and established his dominion over home plate by leading the National League in hit batsmen four years in a row.His career record of 224-184 included 151 compete games and 40 shutouts. Last season, both major leagues produced a total of just 83 compete games.¬†Befitting his cold-blooded approach to pitching, Bunning was known as ‚ÄúLizard.‚Äù With a long, sweeping delivery and an arm slot somewhere between sidearm and three-quarters, he could be as hard to square up as a pinata.Though Ted Williams eventually extracted payback ‚Äì homering twice in a July¬†1957 rematch in Detroit ‚Äì Bunning won that game and would dominate¬†many of the top hitters of his time. According to retrosheet.org, he struck out Mickey Mantle 23 times in 58 at bats, held Willie Mays to a .213 batting average, allowed Hank Aaron only one home run and laid waste to such luminaries as Harmon Killebrew (.191), Eddie Mathews (.122) Brooks Robinson (.190) and Willie Stargell (.190).Bill James, the father of baseball statistical analysis, says Bunning was the best pitcher of both 1957 and 1967. That he never won a Cy Young Award and languished on the Hall of Fame ballot until the Veterans Committee voted him in in 1996 probably owes in part to a career that produced no pennants and in part to a personality that multiple obituaries called ‚Äúcantankerous.‚Äù‚ÄúI have been booed by 60,000 fans at Yankee Stadium standing alone at the pitcher‚Äôs mound, so I have never really cared if I stood alone here in Congress as long as I stood by my beliefs and my values.‚ÄùJim BunningTwice, Bunning asked that his name be removed from the Hall of Fame ballot after years of disappointment. For an accomplished politician, he sometimes behaved as if wooing voters was beneath him.‚ÄúAnything but a glad-hander, Bunning wants you to respect him, but much like Kevin Brown ... he doesn‚Äôt seem to care whether you like him or don‚Äôt,‚Äù James wrote in a 2001 edition of his Historical Baseball Abstract. ‚ÄúHe comes off as very cold, very arrogant.‚ÄùIf these are curious qualities for a politician, Jim Bunning was a man capable of contradictions. Known as one of the most conservative men in Congress, he had earlier helped transform the Major League Baseball Players Association into one of America‚Äôs most successful labor unions.As a member of the screening committee that vetted Marvin Miller, Bunning contributed to the change in baseball‚Äôs balance of power much as Ronald Reagan impacted Hollywood as president of the Screen Actors Guild. He was, for better or worse, his own man.‚ÄúI have been booed by 60,000 fans at Yankee Stadium standing alone at the pitcher‚Äôs mound, so I have never really cared if I stood alone here in Congress as long as I stood by my beliefs and my values,‚Äù Bunning said in his farewell address on Dec. 9, 2010. ‚ÄúI have also thought that being able to throw a curveball never was a bad skill for a politician to have.‚ÄùFor the record, it was Bunning's slider that bedeviled¬†Ted Williams.Tim Sullivan can be reached at (502) 582-4650, tsullivan@courier-journal.com or @TimSullivan714 on Twitter.
