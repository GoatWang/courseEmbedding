KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II - OFFERING


The following website material is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II; offering is only made by prospectus. This information must be preceded or accompanied by a prospectus in order to understand fully all of the implications and risks of the offering. Neither the Attorney General of the State of New York nor any other state regulators have passed on or endorsed the merits of this offering. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.
Click on the document link to view prospectus and supplements. For more information contact the KBS Sales Desk: 866-527-4264
To continue please acknowledge that you have received a copy of the prospectus by clicking the button below. 
Please click on Important Risk Factors to learn more about risks you should consider:
Important Risk Factors 



Shares of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II are not suitable for all investors and an investment in KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II is subject to substantial risks. These risks may include, but are not limited to:

The possibility of losing your entire investment.
No guarantees regarding future performance.
Upon sale or distribution of assets you may receive less than your initial investment.
Fluctuation of the value of the assets owned by KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II.
The absence of a public market for shares of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II.
A lack of an operating history for KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II.
Limited transferability and lack of liquidity.
Reliance on its advisor to select investments, manage and dispose of assets.
Payment of significant fees to its advisor, its affiliates, and participating broker-dealers.
Lack of diversification in property holdings until significant funds have been raised.
Various economic factors that may include changes in interest rates, laws, operating expenses, insurance costs and tenant turnover. These factors may result in reduced earnings, reduction in value of notes/loans, delinquency of payments and default on loans owned by the REIT.
Continued disruptions in the financial markets and deteriorating economic conditions could adversely affect the value of KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s investments.

KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s organizational documents do not restrict it from paying distributions from any source and do not restrict the amount of distributions it may pay from any source, including offering proceeds or borrowings. Distributions paid from sources other than current or accumulated earnings and profits may constitute a return of capital. A return of capital would reduce the amount KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II would have for investment, which could reduce an investor’s return on investment and subsequent investors will experience dilution. There are no guarantees that KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II will pay distributions.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II will pay substantial fees to and expenses of KBS Capital Advisors, its affiliates and participating broker-dealers, which payments will increase the risk that stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment. KBS Capital Advisors and its affiliates, and KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s executive officers, its affiliated directors and other key professionals face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by the advisor’s compensation arrangements with the REIT and other KBS-sponsored programs and KBS-advised investors.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s advisor and its affiliates receive fees in connection with transactions involving the purchase or origination and management of the REIT’s investments. These fees are based on the cost of the investment, and not based on the quality of the investment or the quality of the services rendered to the REIT. This may influence the advisor to recommend riskier transactions to the REIT.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II expects to use debt in connection with its investments, which increases the risk of loss associated with these investments and could hinder its ability to pay distributions to its stockholders or could decrease the value of its stockholders’ investments if income on, or the value of, the property securing the debt declines.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II may make adjustments to its target portfolio, based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities. The REIT may change its targeted investments and investment guidelines at any time without the consent of its stockholders.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II expects to make foreign investments and will be susceptible to changes in currency exchange rates, adverse political or economic developments, lack of uniform accounting standards and changes in foreign laws which may adversely affect the investment portfolio of the REIT, thereby affecting the value of the investor’s investment in the REIT. Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s ability to implement its business strategy and generate returns for its stockholders.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s charter does not require it to liquidate its assets and dissolve by a specified date, nor does the charter require it to list its shares for trading by a specified date. No public market currently exists for its shares, and it has no plans to list its shares on a national securities exchange. If a stockholder is able to sell his or her shares, that stockholder would likely have to sell them at a substantial discount from their public offering price.
If KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II does not raise significant proceeds in its public offering, it may not be able to acquire as diverse portfolio of real estate investments and the value of its stockholders’ investment may vary more widely with the performance of specific assets.
Disruptions in the financial markets and uncertain economic conditions could adversely affect KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s ability to implement its business strategy and generate returns for its stockholders.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s share price is set arbitrarily and the price is unrelated to the book or net value of assets owned by the REIT or to its expected operating income. No public market currently exists for shares of the REIT, and the REIT has no plans to list its shares on an exchange. In addition, the shares are subject to restrictions on transferability and re-sale and investors will be required to bear the financial risk of this investment for an indefinite period of time. If investors are able to sell shares, they will likely have to sell them at a substantial loss.
There is no guarantee that KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II will be able to provide liquidity by a certain date, or at all, or that any liquidity event would be successful. Investors may be required to hold their shares indefinitely.
Because KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II has not yet identified any specific investments to acquire, it is considered a blind pool.
KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II intends to elect to be taxed as a REIT beginning with the taxable year ending December 31, 2014. Should KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II not qualify as a REIT, it will be subject to adverse tax consequences. Please refer to the prospectus for more detailed information regarding these consequences.
An investment in KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II’s shares is complex. Investors should read and consider the prospectus, as amended and supplemented, carefully before investing.

KBS-CMG’s affiliated company, KBS Capital Advisors, is a real estate operating company that serves as the advisor to the KBS REITs, which include KBS REIT I (closed after raising more than $1.7 billion), KBS REIT II (closed after raising more than $1.8 billion), KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT (closed after raising more than $561 million), KBS Legacy Partners Apartment REIT (closed after raising more than $191 million), KBS REIT III (closed after raising more than $1.7 billion), KBS Strategic Opportunity REIT II and KBS Growth & Income REIT.
The original entity within the current KBS family of companies is KBS Realty Advisors, founded in 1992 by industry leaders Peter Bren and Charles J. Schreiber Jr. KBS Realty Advisors, together with it’s affiliates, has provided real estate investments on behalf of large institutional clients such as public and private pension plans, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds and seven non-traded REITs. In October 2015, National Real Estate Investor ranked KBS the 9th largest office owner globally.
Large institutional investors have selected KBS because KBS’ senior staff is comprised of real estate professionals who average more than 23 years of hands-on real estate experience. KBS has invested, managed or owned nationwide more than $21.7 billion in 1,604 assets nationwide (over 146.4 million square feet not including REIT acquired debt assets). KBS has sold 1,112 assets since inception. Fourteen KBS investment funds totaling more than 42.5 million square feet of real estate have gone full-cycle.*
* Information as of December 31, 2015 for all KBS entities and is not specific to a particular REIT. Square footage does not include REIT acquired debt assets.

	Opus National Industrial Portfolio





	On June 1, 2007, KBS Capital Advisors LLC, the Companys external advisor (the Advisor), entered into purchase and sale agreements with Opus Real Estate VI Limited Partnership, MBS Arlington Limited Partnership, and
	OIRE Michigan, L.L.C., respectively, to purchase a portfolio of nine distribution and office/warehouse properties located in six states (the Opus National Industrial Portfolio). The portfolio consists of properties totaling approximately
	2.3 million rentable square feet. On June 29, 2007, the Advisor assigned these purchase and sale agreements to indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company for no consideration. Pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements, the
	Company would be obligated to purchase the portfolio only after satisfactory completion of agreed upon closing conditions. The sellers are not affiliated with the Company or the Advisor.




	The purchase price of the Opus National Industrial Portfolio is $126.0 million plus closing costs. The Company would fund the purchase of the Opus
	National Industrial Portfolio with proceeds from the Companys ongoing initial public offering but may later place mortgage debt on the portfolio.




	The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the properties.

	Investment in the Tribeca Senior Mortgage Participation





	On June 28, 2007, the Company, through
	an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, purchased a 25% interest (the Senior Mortgage Participation) in the senior mortgage loans related to the conversion of an eight-story loft building into a ten-story condominium building located at 415
	Greenwich Street in New York, New York (the Tribeca Building), from an unaffiliated seller. The senior mortgage loans are secured by the Tribeca Building. The purchase price of the Senior Mortgage Participation was approximately $23.5
	million plus closing costs. After the closing, the Company remains obligated to fund an additional $2.3 million under the Senior Mortgage Participation for costs related to the conversion of the Tribeca Building. The Company purchased the Senior
	Mortgage Participation with proceeds from the Companys ongoing initial public offering.




	The Senior Mortgage Participation is a 25%
	interest in three senior mortgage loans as well as an interest-only participation in the same mortgage loans. The three mortgage loans consist of (i) a senior mortgage loan in the principal amount of $62.5 million, (ii) a
	building mortgage loan in the principal amount of up to $37.9 million and (iii) a project mortgage loan in the principal amount of $2.8 million. As of June 28, 2007, all amounts under the three mortgage loans had been advanced, except that
	only $28.8 million of the $37.9 million building mortgage loan had been advanced. Under the Senior Mortgage Participation, the Company is obligated to fund 25% of the $9.1 million that remains unfunded under the building mortgage loan as of
	June 28, 2007. The borrower under each of the three mortgage loans is 415 Greenwich Fee Owner LLC (the Fee Owner). Neither the Company nor the Advisor is affiliated with the Fee Owner.




	The $94.1 million currently outstanding under senior mortgage loans bears interest at a variable rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 2.70%, including the interest
	rate on the interest-only participation in the mortgage loans. The future funding obligation under the building mortgage loan will bear interest at a variable rate of 30-day LIBOR plus 3.00%. The initial maturity date of the senior
	mortgage loans is May 1, 2008, with a one-year extension option subject to certain conditions. Prior to maturity, the borrower under the senior mortgage loans is required to make monthly interest-only payments to the Company, with the
	outstanding principal balance being due at maturity.







	The remaining 75% interest in the three senior mortgage loans is held by AIG Annuity Insurance Company
	and the remaining 75% interest in the interest-only participation in these three mortgage loans is held by AIG Mortgage Capital LLC. The Companys right to repayment under the Senior Mortgage Participation is parri passu with that
	of the other noteholders.




	In the event that (i) payment of principal or interest on the mortgage loans becomes 90 days or more
	delinquent, (ii) the mortgage loan has been accelerated, (iii) the principal balance on the mortgage loan is not paid at maturity, (iv) the borrower under the mortgage loans files for bankruptcy, (v) the holders of the
	participations in the three senior loans are unable to provide unanimous consent on certain major decisions or (vi) the borrower fails to satisfy certain other conditions of the mortgage documents and all of the holders of the loans do not
	grant approval, the holder of the 75% participation in the senior mortgage loans has the right to purchase the Companys Senior Mortgage Participation. In the event that the holder of the 75% participation in the senior mortgage loans does not
	purchase the Companys interest, the Company has the right to purchase the 75% participation in the senior mortgage loans.




	The holder
	of the 75% participation in the senior mortgage loans has exclusive authority with respect to the administration of the mortgage loans and the exercise of rights and remedies with respect to the mortgage loan, except that unanimous consent of the
	holders, is required with respect to (i) any material modification or waiver of a monetary term of the mortgage loans, (ii) an extension of the maturity date, (iii) a reduction in the interest rate or monthly debt service payment,
	(iv) a sale of the secured property (other than the sale of condominiums) for an amount less than necessary to ensure repayment plus certain costs incurred by the holders of the mortgage notes, and (v) other limited matters set forth in
	the participation agreement. With respect to certain bad boy acts, amounts outstanding under the mortgage loans are guaranteed by the two individuals who have indirect interests in the Tribeca Building.




	As of June 28, 2007, the Company had also invested an aggregate of $46.7 million in two mezzanine loans on the Tribeca Building.
