About 2U





Education is one of the most powerful drivers of change and upward mobility. At 2U, we empower forward-thinking universities to reimagine education, ensuring that students everywhere can dream bigger, reach their highest potential and fulfill their aspirations through life-changing educational experiences. We help universities become the best possible digital versions of themselves so they can offer more students than ever access to transformative education.
2U was founded in 2008 when a small team began working on one big idea: to build online degree programs as good as, or better than, traditional on-campus programs at top universities.
In the early days, our work was met with skepticism. It was believed then — and some believe it still — that an online program could never match the quality of education delivered on campus.
At 2U, we believed — and still believe — that while higher education is changing rapidly, universities that embrace the power of technology will uphold their missions and continue to grow at a scale never imagined. We also believe great universities can and will continue to be the single most important catalyst for societal change.
Our partners are creating a future where online students have the same rights and responsibilities as their on-campus counterparts. We succeed because, at our core, we believe in this future, from our executives to our marketing managers to our support counselors. Every 2U employee is united, with our university partners, in fulfilling the promise of education.







Our Philosophy
One idea guides everything we do at 2U: No Back Row®, the idea that every person counts; each person is and feels included; and when we each lean in and do our part, we are better individually and collectively. This philosophy is fundamental to the learning experiences 2U creates with our partners and is at the core of the company we are building. The eight guiding principles that drive our corporate culture derive from No Back Row, as does our work with our university partners and with one another. Discover No Back Row >







The 2U Platform
Through our integrated Platform, a fusion of cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology and technology-enabled services, 2U provides schools with the comprehensive operating infrastructure they need to attract, enroll, educate and support students globally. See how we do it >







Our Impact
2U and our partner universities believe that online education can produce life-changing outcomes for students and the communities they touch. Together, we are redefining how a great university can measure success. Learn about 2U's Impact >

The 2U Platform  











The 2U Platform


 


Our comprehensive approach allows universities to create great digital versions of themselves.
The iconic building becomes a well-designed learning management system. The brick paths become a complex web of back-end infrastructure. The intimate classrooms become live video with no back row. The larger-than-life professors are now connected through a device held in the palm of their hands. Doing this is time-consuming and requires significant resources, but helping universities develop great digital versions of themselves is our business, and our Platform allows our partners to advance their missions by increasing access to education through technology.
The following sections explore the 2U Platform and indicate who is responsible for each element: 2U, the university, or 2U and the university.






Funding
(2U)
The great digital version of a university requires quality and scale, both of which demand significant time and resources. In each program we launch, 2U invests $5-10 million of cumulative net negative cash over the first three to five years. This investment allows the program to achieve the quality and scale necessary to drive a positive impact for the university. 2U continues to support each program through the rest of the long-term (10 years or more) commitment, earning a return on its investment over that time. Our proprietary Program Selection Algorithm identifies the best university and degree pairings for potential programs.



 



Content Development
(2U + UNIVERSITY)
2U works with faculty to ensure that professors are able to bring their curriculum to life in the digital medium. We do this with our Online Campus; proprietary methods that feature videos and case studies; and engaging, interactive content. 2U supports all university partner faculty members throughout the lifespan of each course, and we build all content to be easily updated as professors’ lectures evolve over time. While 2U funds the development of the intellectual property, all rights are owned by the university.



 



Technology
(2U)
2U's Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) offering supports the front- and back-end technology that allows our partner universities to create great digital versions of themselves. In addition to the student-facing Online Campus, our integrated, cloud-based platform provides the comprehensive operating infrastructure necessary to attract, enroll, educate, support and graduate students globally. This technology creates a seamless user experience — from application integration to content management to the workings of the Online Campus, and more.



 



Student Acquisition
(2U)
2U's goal is not just to find applicants, but to find the right students with the right requirements at the right time for the right program. To do this, we employ modern marketing strategies that help elite universities grow their reach without diluting their brands. Our machine learning investments provide us insight into prospects, allowing us to spend economically and intelligently. Our recruiting service includes admissions support, such as guiding prospects through the application process, reviewing transcripts and facilitating live interviews.



 



Admissions & Financial Aid
(UNIVERSITY)
All admissions and financial aid decisions are made by the university. Our university partners maintain high admissions standards for their online programs and are exclusively responsible for developing the program's admissions criteria and making admissions decisions. The processing and handling of all financial aid is also the purview of our university partners. These are not 2U programs, but rather Georgetown, USC and Northwestern programs.



 



Faculty, Instruction & Academic Services
(UNIVERSITY)
Every academic function that has traditionally been the province of universities remains the purview of 2U’s university partners. 2U does not hire faculty to teach 2U-powered programs nor do we provide academic services – and we never will. In fact, when we founded the company, we called it 2tor, but later changed the name because we felt it gave the impression that we provided instruction. Our university partners hire all faculty, so when a student enrolls in a 2U-powered program, classes are taught by real Berkeley or George Washington or UNC faculty. Why? Because these are Berkeley or GW or UNC programs, and students earn a Berkeley or GW or UNC degree. In addition, all academic functions are handled by the university, including academic advising, program review and assessment, grading, awarding credit, awarding degrees and program accreditation.



 



Student Support
(2U)
Students in 2U-powered programs are often juggling families and challenging careers as they complete their degree. It’s not easy — which is why we offer more than just technical support. Each student in a 2U partner program is assigned a student support advisor, who can offer 24/7 support and guidance throughout his or her journey. 2U also offers career services to help ensure students and graduates achieve their desired career outcomes. The career services team works with each university partner to provide integrated support and resources throughout the student life cycle and after graduation.



 



Faculty Support & Enrichment
(2U)
2U's faculty training and engagement team prepares faculty to teach in the online environment. We are responsible for the successful onboarding, ongoing enrichment and continuous support for faculty in all 2U partner programs. Our goal is to empower faculty to maintain the highest quality learning environments to ensure maximum learning outcomes. We support each live class with tech support, but we also work one-on-one with faculty to offer guidance on leveraging tools available through the Online Campus.



 



Real-world Experiences
(2U + UNIVERSITY)
Some disciplines simply cannot be taught without hands-on experiences. From business global immersions to nursing on-campus intensives to social work field placements, 2U provides resources and technology to support our partner universities in facilitating these experiences.



 



Placements
(2U + UNIVERSITY)
2U’s placement specialists build relationships with sites coast-to-coast so they can match each student with the right faculty-approved supervisor and experience. The placement team finds and secures appropriate sites for students by vetting potential sites and supervisors, collecting documentation and facilitating agreements to grow our placement network. Our team is fully engaged so students can complete their degree programs as planned, preparing them for fulfilling and rewarding careers.



 



Immersion Support
(2U + UNIVERSITY)
Students in many 2U-powered programs attend immersions in cities around the world. Hosted in international business centers like London, Mumbai and Shanghai, immersions offer students the chance to meet classmates and faculty in person and learn from business leaders. These experiences can be life-changing as students network with influential thinkers and engage in collaborative learning experiences.

About 2U





Education is one of the most powerful drivers of change and upward mobility. At 2U, we empower forward-thinking universities to reimagine education, ensuring that students everywhere can dream bigger, reach their highest potential and fulfill their aspirations through life-changing educational experiences. We help universities become the best possible digital versions of themselves so they can offer more students than ever access to transformative education.
2U was founded in 2008 when a small team began working on one big idea: to build online degree programs as good as, or better than, traditional on-campus programs at top universities.
In the early days, our work was met with skepticism. It was believed then — and some believe it still — that an online program could never match the quality of education delivered on campus.
At 2U, we believed — and still believe — that while higher education is changing rapidly, universities that embrace the power of technology will uphold their missions and continue to grow at a scale never imagined. We also believe great universities can and will continue to be the single most important catalyst for societal change.
Our partners are creating a future where online students have the same rights and responsibilities as their on-campus counterparts. We succeed because, at our core, we believe in this future, from our executives to our marketing managers to our support counselors. Every 2U employee is united, with our university partners, in fulfilling the promise of education.







Our Philosophy
One idea guides everything we do at 2U: No Back Row®, the idea that every person counts; each person is and feels included; and when we each lean in and do our part, we are better individually and collectively. This philosophy is fundamental to the learning experiences 2U creates with our partners and is at the core of the company we are building. The eight guiding principles that drive our corporate culture derive from No Back Row, as does our work with our university partners and with one another. Discover No Back Row >







The 2U Platform
Through our integrated Platform, a fusion of cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) technology and technology-enabled services, 2U provides schools with the comprehensive operating infrastructure they need to attract, enroll, educate and support students globally. See how we do it >







Our Impact
2U and our partner universities believe that online education can produce life-changing outcomes for students and the communities they touch. Together, we are redefining how a great university can measure success. Learn about 2U's Impact >
