              Abstract




26-Hydroxycholesterol is a naturally occurring metabolic product derived from cholesterol. Recent investigations suggest that this metabolite plays a role as a feedback inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis and may be involved in down regulation of LDL receptors. The absence of 26-hydroxycholesterol has been postulated to be the molecular basis of the genetic disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The discovery that this compound is produced in vascular epithelium suggests that 26-hydroxycholesterol may have use for the prevention of restenosis following balloon angioplasty. 26-Hydroxycholesterol prepared by current procedures may be contaminated with significant quantities of diastereomeric impurities. Furthermore, engineering difficulties make the scale up of current syntheses unlikely. Both factors are obstacles in developing this potential drug. In order to develop this compound as a therapeutic agent, additional chemistry and biological efforts are required. In Phase I of this proposal, the development of a synthesis which provides the natural product with purity suitable for pharmaceutical development is proposed. This chemistry will also be used to prepare the unnatural diastereomer. HPLC studies will be conducted to develop a method for the determination of pharmaceutical grade purity. These efforts will set the stage for advanced biological testing and chemical development targeted for Phase II.

“Visionary” Winemaker Hits A 94pt Home Run
The deeply concentrated bloom of a historic house, this is the Châteauneuf-du-Pape deal of the vintage. Wine Spectator, highly bullish on the CdP ’12s, pinned 94 points on this Château Sixtine, calling it “an intense red, with cascading layers,” of dark fruit and spice. Today, fourth-generation winemaker Jean Marc Diffonty is releasing some of the greatest wines ever to come out of Château Sixtine. An “innovative visionary” according to Robert Parker, Diffonty has successfully modernized the ancient property, turning out voluptuous blends of flowing elegance and fine-grained tannins — never more so than in the knockout 2012 vintage. Just 65 cases for lovers of classic CdP.
Jean Marc took the business over from his father, Félicien — a charismatic if grumpy local character who served as mayor of Châteauneuf-du-Pape for three decades. A member of the old-guard, Félicien’s winemaking style had grown rigid. Jean Marc sought new expressions for the storied estate, employing temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks, drastically lowering yields, and experimenting with new oak. In 2012, these measures resulted in an instant classic.  
A watershed vintage, 2012 in Southern Rhône had vignerons practically jumping for joy.  The season started out cold but by early summer had warmed significantly. Ripening accelerated, tempered by rainfall and cool nights, as the old vines across Château Sixtine’s 37 acres produced tiny berries of awesome power and freshness.
Open up now and linger over a mesmerizing, floral-scented aromatic profile that evolves for 2+ hours, or put this brooding beauty to rest for another 15 years.








Tasting Notes


2012 Chateau Sixtine Chateauneuf-du-Pape
 Wine Access
The 2012 Chateau Sixtine is a dark and deep wine with brilliant crimson color. Pure, intense dark berry and earthy aromas. On the palate, the mellow, well-integrated oak adds a layer of silkiness. A well-balanced tannin structure, precision, and just the right balance of fruit give this wine its full personality. Its delicate, subtle scents lead you to a delightfully long, fresh finish. The silkiness of the wine dominates throughout the tasting. A jewel of a wine.
94 Points Wine Spectator
An intense red, with cascading flavors of dark fig, cassis, blackberry pâte de fruit and plum sauce, underscored by notes of dark licorice and ganache. The long finish features lots of black tea and graphite accents, while a dusting of cocoa powder adds texture. Best from 2015 through 2030. 2,000 cases made.

Wine Growing Regions




Across the wine world, different regions are known for both producing different grapes and different styles of wine.
The distinction between Old World wine regions and New World wine regions is particularly important: as a sweeping generalization, Old World regions are known for producing wines that are more austere and terroir driven, while New World regions are known for producing wines with greater intensity. For example, Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in France will likely produce wines marked by earthiness and subtle fruit flavors, while Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown in California will likely produce wines that are more fruit-forward.
But different wine regions are also often associated with the production of different grapes. For example, within France, Bordeaux is associated with red wines made primarily from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Cabernet Franc grapes, while Burgundy is associated with red wines made from the Pinot Noir grape. Use this page to find top-rated wines from wine regions throughout the world and learn about each region’s wine-making profile.
