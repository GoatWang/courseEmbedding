Purple Beverage Company, Inc. (OTC Pink: PPBV) is a company that develops, markets, and distributes an antioxidant beverage called Purple. Its flagship product contains a high level of antioxidants, as measured in ORAC values, from seven different fruit sources, including the acai berry, black cherry, pomegranate, black currant, purple plum, cranberry and blueberry.
The company was founded in 2007 by entrepreneur Ted Farnsworth. Its headquarters is in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Purple also has satellite offices in Weehawken, New Jersey; Franklin, Massachusetts; and Danville, California. In December 2007, the company’s stock became publicly tradable with the completion of a reverse merger transaction with Red Carpet Entertainment, Inc.[1] In January, Purple Beverage Company announced a distribution agreement with General Nutrition Centers (GNC).[2]
On July 22, 2008, the company filed a standard character trademark with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the slogan "Purple, Life’s Superdrink."[3]
The beverage Purple can be found in selected GNC stores, health food stores, restaurants, delis, drug stores, supermarkets, and convenience store locations.
The company ceased operations in late 2009 and the product is no longer available.

	An expert in strategic development, marketing and consumer relations, Mr. Farnsworth has utilized these assets and skills in building companies throughout his 30-year career.

“As we are dedicated to providing excellence in every aspect of real estate investment, we are bringing together high-performance experts whose proven leadership combines decades of pinnacle brand expertise and market cycle success,” quoted by Millennial Hotel Group.

Ted Farnsworth Scams | Facts About Theodore Farnsworth’s Business


May 27, 2015 by Dr. Letitia Wright    Filed under Featured Articles, Front Page


Leave a Comment



Ted Farnsworth is in the news quite frequently and because he is, sometimes you will see postings and comments on the internet saying that Ted is a scam artist. Everyone knows that scam artist do exist and everyone knows that scam artists are ruthless in their quest for money. However you can normally spot a scam artist right away with a little common sense.
 What most people don’t understand is, those who write blog posts about Ted Farnsworth and many other entrepreneurs, don’t care if the information they give is true or false if it draws attention to their blogs and articles.
The Truth About Ted Farnsworth And His Scams
The truth is that most articles accusing business people of being scam artists have one sided views and the majority of the Entrepreneur’s aren’t scam artists at all.  They are strictly entrepreneurs who had a business venture or two that failed. There is nothing wrong with this, and it does not mean that they are scam artists at all.
 If you can show me an entrepreneur who hasn’t failed at some point, then they really are not an entrepreneur, or good business person. If you Google “Donald Trump scam” you will find 410,000 results. If you Google Warren Buffett or even Bill Gates you will find people on the internet who call them scam artist. Because of mistakes or even things that people have blown out of proportion that have happened in those Entrepreneur’s lives. Last but not least, if you Google “Mother Theresa scam” you will find 432,000 results. One of the top results says Mother Theresa was a crook and a fraud. In conclusion, there will always be some people out there trying to dis-credit those Entrepreneur’s and people in general who are trying to get ahead in life and make the world a better place to live.
There is a very true lesson to be learned while thinking along this subject. You can always find bad in people whether it is true or false, when you are looking for it. So we need to look for the good in people and keep our eyes out for those who are scam artists.  
Is Theodore Farnsworth Honest Or A Crook?

But honest ones with integrity like Ted Farnsworth go out every day and try to do good. Even when the accusations come, true Entrepreneurs and honest business people will keep going and do as much good as they can no matter what comes their way. 
Here are some things that were discovered about Ted Farnsworth that you may not know that are true. Despite all the Scam artist claims, Ted kept going and doing good in his life, he is a true Entrepreneur.
He is also the Chairman and Founder of The Highlander Companies and Chairman and Founder of Millennial Hotel Group. He is responsible for the strategic direction of these companies, for investment and financing activities across all capital platforms, and for the creation and pursuit of new real estate development opportunities and their acquisition.
