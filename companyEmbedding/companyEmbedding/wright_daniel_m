Our Mission and Purpose
We’re the Prophecy Watchers. We have a long history of working to bring the truth of Bible prophecy to an audience of Christian believers who may not have local access to sound prophetic teaching, based upon the inspired writings of the Apostles and the traditional doctrine concerning the rapture of the church. We honor this two-thousand-year-old teaching tradition, reawakened nearly two centuries ago, by men of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, who strived to bring this truth to the church.
Our theological perspective is premillennial and pretribulational, because we believe that this position offers the best possible understanding of God’s prophetic purpose and His plan for mankind.
We believe that the systematic theology of men like Lewis Sperry Chafer, John F. Walvoord, Charles Ryrie, Dwight Pentecost, Thomas Ice, Arnold Fruchtenbaum, Tim LaHaye and others who have upheld this position, forms a solid core of teaching that literally dates back to the days of the Apostles.
This theology nearly vanished during the Dark Ages, not to rise again to prominence until the mid-19th century, in the teachings of men like John Nelson Darby and those who followed him. His teaching was not a new theory, but simply the renewal of a doctrine that had gone dormant. It had been subverted by a later doctrine that mixed the prophetic roles of Israel and the church. Sadly, this confusion still prevails among many Christians to this day.
In the first century, when the Apostle Paul spoke of “the blessed hope,” his message plainly presented the pretribulational rapture of the church.
We believe that Bible prophecy describes the latter-day return of Israel in unbelief, leading them to experience a series of shattering challenges that will ultimately bring them into the Kingdom Age. Today’s Israel is scripturally identifiable as having received the first of many prophetic blessings – their return to the Promised Land.
At the present time, the global map is being shaped into the political blocs prophesied by Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah and other Old Testament prophets. Some of these projections of power are beginning to be recognizable. Following a series of massive conflicts, this system will give rise to the Antichrist. But before that horrific event, the church will be removed from the Earth, in the rapture.
An integral part of these developments is the active role now being played by men of God, who are currently engaged in alerting those who will hear, to a number of emergent scenarios. Among these, Israel is the focal point of action.
We also believe Jesus taught that the latter days would resemble the ancient “days of Noah,” when supernatural beings walked among men, corrupting them to such an extent that the world had to be cleansed by the Great Flood of Noah. Many are engaged in the documentation of current phenomena that convince us we’ve arrived at this prophesied time.
Though we don’t believe in setting dates, it is clear that the rapture of the church is imminent, perhaps much nearer than we think. We can’t think of a more encouraging message than this.

Obituary - Wright, Daniel M.









Wright, Daniel M.Visitation:Date: Saturday, March 1, 2014 Time: 12:00 PM to 4:00 PMVisitation Location:Baue Funeral and Memorial Center,  3950 West Clay Street,  St. Charles, MO  Service:Date: Saturday, March 1, 2014 Time: 4:00 PMService Location:Baue Funeral and Memorial Center, St. Charles, MOInterment:1:30 PM Monday, March 3, 2014 at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery, St. Louis, MOMemorials / Donations: May be made to Lake St. Louis Water Ski Club Scholarship Fund,  6290 #105 Ronald Reagan Drive, Lake St. Louis, MO  63367ObituaryOBITUARY
Daniel M. Wright of Lake St. Louis, MO departed this life, surrounded by love of his wife and family, on February 20, 2014, having reached the age of sixty-nine years, nine months and seventeen days.  Dan, as he was known to all, was born in Santa Rosa, CA on May 3, 1944, son of Theodore Philip Wright and Rose Frances Wright nee Goshen.  As a young man, he was united in marriage and blessed to have three sons.  On March 18, 2000, he was united in marriage to Mary Ann Mueller nee Waldo and their families were joined as one.

Dan is survived by his wife, Mary Wright of Lake St. Louis, MO, formerly Lonedell, MO; by three sons, Daniel R. Wright, known to some as Giz and to others as Danny, and wife, Amy, of Wentzville, MO, by twins Donald Wright and wife, Stephanie, of Orlando, FL and Douglas Wright and wife, Angela, of O'Fallon, MO; by three step-children, Tamra Mueller of New York, NY, formerly Lonedell, Tema Mueller-Boigner and husband, Brian, of Atlanta, GA, formerly Lonedell and Tyson Mueller and wife, Heaven, of Farmington, MO, formerly Lonedell; by one sister, Judy Crowder and husband, Rick, of  Rosheron, TX; by his mother-in-law, Shirley Waldo of Lonedell, MO; by ten grandchildren, Mason Wright of Wentzville, Corbin, Logan and Ashlyn Wright of O'Fallon, Madison Wright of Orlando, Taylor, Ally and Tyler Mueller of Farmington and Bryce and Sarah Boigner of Atlanta; by his sisters-in-law, Linda Rucker and Nancy Russell both of Lonedell; by one uncle,  nieces, nephews, great and great-great-nieces and nephews, cousins, other relatives and many, many friends and business associates.

Dan was preceded in death by his parents, Theodore and Frances Wright; and by his father-in-law Russell Waldo.

Dan was a Christian and member of Living Lord Lutheran Church of Lake St. Louis, MO.  Dan was proud to have served his country in the United States Air Force entering September 10, 1962 and receiving his honorable discharge on August 19, 1964.  Dan began his working career at a young age at Oscar Wilson Engines and Parts in O'Fallon, MO. On August 1, 1980, he purchased the business and served as the Chief Executive Officer and Principle Partner. At that time, the company employed six full time employees.  He continued to grow and manage the business until his death, which now employs fifty full time employees and has tripled in size.  The company is considered one of the premier wholesale distributors by its suppliers and fellow distributors in the outdoor power equipment industry.     As an employer, Dan was loved and respected by many in his industry.  In 1996 he was featured on the front cover of the St. Louis Business Journal to recognize his accomplishments as a local entrepreneur.

Dan was a man that loved life and had many hobbies and interests. He also loved children and as his boys were growing up he enjoyed serving as a coach for their Little League teams.  For two decades, he was member, driver and instructor of the Lake St. Louis Water Ski Club.  He donated his time and patience to help the "Junior Line" learn to ski and perform and was passionate about his role in the club. He has pulled thousands of skiers behind his boat and has helped mold young skiers into responsible adults. He always told the kids, "Look up, stay up. Look down, fall down." and at the end of the practice he'd tell them, "Now go home and clean your room". Traveling with Mary in his Marathon Motor Coach gave him great joy and they traveled throughout the United States, towing their motorcycles wherever they went, so at their destination they could go for a bike ride.  They looked forward to spending their winters on their property in Florida.  For several years they enjoyed spending time at the Lake of the Ozarks and later on the Mississippi River, traveling as far as Nashville, TN on their big boat.  He was proud to have obtained his Captain's license.
Above all else, nothing meant more to Dan than his family and taking care of Mary, his true soul mate, and of course their little Maltese, "Diamond".  He was happiest when he was giving and sharing with his family.  Nothing made him happier than the time spent with Mary and his children and grandchildren.  "His babies" as he affectionately referred to his grandchildren, were special and dear to him and he cherished the time they shared.  He was there for grandparents' day and all the special events, as this gave him great joy.

A devoted and loving husband, father, father-in-law, step-father,  grandpa, step-grandpa, son-in-law, brother, brother-in-law, nephew, uncle, great and great-great-uncle, cousin and friend, he will be sadly missed and lovingly remembered by all who knew and loved him.

A celebration of life and visitation was held from 12:00 to 4:00 pm with funeral services at 4:00 pm on Saturday, March 1, 2014 at Baue Funeral and Memorial Center in St. Charles, MO with Pastor Roy Christell officiating.  Committal services, with full military honors, was held at 1:30 pm on Monday, March 3, 2014 at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis, MO.  Flowers are welcome or memorials may be made to Lake St. Louis Water Ski Club Scholarship Fund, 6290 #105  Ronald Reagan Dr., Lake St. Louis, MO 63367. The family was served by Russell Colonial Funeral Home, St. Clair, MO.
