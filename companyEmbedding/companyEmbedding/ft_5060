Customer Questions & Answers








            can this be used as a sump pump discharge hose in the winter time?
        

            can this be used as a sump pump discharge hose in the winter time?
        
Asked by: noodle

            Hello!
There are considerations that have to be taken into account.  #1-The thermostat for the K&amp;H Thermo-Hose is in the cord.  If you plug this cord in inside the home, the thermostat will never turn on since it will  be at room temperature.  #2-If you do plug the hose in outside to where the thermostat will turn on, you will have to connect it to something-and the connections would not be heated so they will freeze.  If you are able to address these two considerations, it should work just fine.

            Is this hose ok to use for drinking water for camper hook up?
        


Asked by: jason

            The Thermo-Hose is no approved for potable water and is not recommended for use as an RV water source.  Using the Thermo-Hose as a water source for an RV can damage the RV water connections as these connections are not heated and can freeze when water is not moving through the hose.

Forty years of vegetation change on the Missouri River floodplainProduct Type: Journal ArticleYear: 2012Author(s): Johnson, W.C., M.D. Dixon, M.L. Scott, L. Rabbe, G. Larson, M. Volke, and B. WernerSuggested Citation: Johnson, W.C., M.D. Dixon, M.L. Scott, L. Rabbe, G. Larson, M. Volke, and B. Werner. 2012. Forty years of vegetation change on the Missouri River floodplain. BioScience. 62(2): 123-135. Comparative inventories in 1969 and 1970 and in 2008 of vegetation from 30 forest stands downstream of Garrison Dam on the Missouri River in central North Dakota showed (a) a sharp decline in Cottonwood regeneration; (b) a strong compositional shift toward dominance by green ash; and (c) large increases in invasive understory species, such as smooth brome, reed canary grass, and Canada thistle. These changes, and others discovered during remeasurement, have been caused by a complex of factors, some related to damming (altered hydrologic and sediment regimes, delta formation, and associated wet—dry cycles) and some not (diseases and expansion of invasive plants). Dominance of green ash, however, may be short lived, given the likelihood that the emerald ash borer will arrive in the Dakotas in 5–10 years, with potentially devastating effects. The prospects for recovery of this valuable ecosystem, rich in ecosystem goods and services and in American history, are daunting.
