John L. Lahey (born 1946) is the president of Quinnipiac University.[1]
Biography[edit]
John Lahey was raised in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in New York City,[2] where he attended and graduated from Fordham Preparatory School in 1964. He earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Miami, bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Philosophy from the University of Dayton and a second master’s degree in Higher Education Administration from Columbia University.
John L. Lahey was Executive Vice President of Marist College, where he served as Chief Operating Officer. He has been Quinnipiac’s president since 1987. Upon his arrival, Lahey initiated a strategic planning process, leading to the University’s unprecedented growth over the past two decades in enrollment, academic programs, reputation and physical plant.
Lahey is a director of the United Illuminating Company, the Aristotle Corporation, the Yale-New Haven Hospital, and the Alliance for Gene Cancer Therapy. He is a member of the Council of the American Bar Association Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar. As Vice-Chairman of the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade Committee, he has devoted much of his time to educating the public about the historic implications of Ireland’s Great Hunger. In 1997, Lahey served as Grand Marshal of the Saint Patrick's Day Parade in New York City.[2] In 2011, Lahey was named Irish American of the Year by Irish America magazine.[3]
As of April 14, 2017, John Lahey has announced his retirement at the end of the 2017-18 fiscal year at Quinnipiac University. At the time of his retirement, he will have served Quinnipiac as president for 31 years and 3 months, watching the student body grow from 1,902 students to roughly 10,000.

Careers





































A Place Where Professionals Want to Work
At Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, patient care always comes first. Because of our focus on excellence in patient care, Lahey Hospital & Medical Center continues to attract the best people across all departments and disciplines. The first requirement for creating this environment is the expectation that all colleagues, regardless of their job, will be treated with dignity and respect. Beyond that, colleagues are provided with a safe work environment where they feel confident in their daily practices, supported by modern technology. Constantly scanning the market from which our colleagues are drawn, Lahey Hospital & Medical Center reviews benefits and pay practices to ensure we remain competitive.

A practice that is perhaps unique to Lahey involves our direct care staff reviewing patient acuity and matching patient needs to available care providers. Beds remain open only when they can be staffed according to these standards. This ensures the consistent delivery of quality patient care.

Lahey Hospital & Medical Center encourages colleagues to continually focus on learning. Lahey believes that continuing education gives colleagues the opportunity to acquire new skills and grow along with our organization.

September 17, 2008
President John L. Lahey
Quinnipiac University
275 Mount Carmel Avenue
Hamden, Connecticut 06518-1908
Sent via U.S. Mail and Facsimile (203-582-8936)
Dear President Lahey:
As you can see from our list of Directors and Board of Advisors, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) unites civil rights and civil liberties leaders, scholars, journalists, and public intellectuals across the political and ideological spectrum on behalf of liberty, legal equality, academic freedom, due process, freedom of speech, freedom of conscience and, as in this case, freedom of association on America’s college campuses. Our website, www.thefire.org, will give you a greater sense of our identity and activities.
FIRE is gravely concerned about the threat to freedom of speech and freedom of association presented by the content of a recent letter sent from a Qunnipiac University (QU) administrator to Jaclyn Hirsch of QU’s chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists.
This is our understanding of the facts; please inform us if you believe we are in error.
Over the course of the 2007–2008 academic year, the Quinnipiac Chronicle, QU’s student newspaper, disagreed with the QU administration over various policies that restricted the activity and autonomy of the newspaper. For instance, QU mandated that the paper’s content could only be posted on the web simultaneously with the publishing of the print version, and in May 2008, QU asserted unprecedented control over the selection of the paper’s leaders. Ultimately, a number of Chronicle staff members and applicants for Chronicle positions founded an independent, online news publication, The Quad News.
Early this academic year, students in the Quinnipiac University Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) and student members of The Quad News jointly participated in activities held on campus. According to a Quad News statement issued on September 13, 2008, the publication had reserved meeting space at QU for weekly meetings, and the reservations had been approved on August 18, 2008, by Esther DeAngelis, Secretary for the Campus Reservation and Information Center.
In response to the interactions between SPJ and The Quad News, on September 8, 2008 (in a letter erroneously dated September 15), Daniel W. Brown, Director of QU’s Student Center and Student Leadership Development, wrote to Jaclyn Hirsch, who is both SPJ president and managing editor of The Quad News. Brown’s letter stated that “any further interaction or endorsements with The QUAD News [sic] could result in the Quinnipiac University Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists losing its recognition status.”
While it is true that QU’s 2008–2009 Student Handbook states that independent organizations such as The Quad News may not “operate on campus,” Brown’s letter goes so far as to ban SPJ’s “interaction” with such a group. Notwithstanding the strange circumstance of someone like Hirsch not being allowed to “interact” with herself, at any public university Brown’s restriction would be a clear violation of the group’s First Amendment right to freedom of association. As the United States Supreme Court has held, “[i]t is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the ‘liberty’ assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech.” NAACP v. Ala. ex. rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958).
We recognize that QU is a private university that may choose to prize certain values higher than those of freedom of expression and freedom of association. We are curious, however, what value Brown is expressing when he bans interaction with an independent student newspaper that has been at odds with QU. Is Brown promoting the value of squelching criticism of the university? Such a value would seem to betray the spirit of debate that should characterize a free marketplace of ideas and a university such as QU, which advertises itself as a “spirited, welcoming campus.” How can students in the core curriculum course QU 101 learn about “the rights and responsibilities of citizenship” when the rights they enjoy as citizens off campus are abruptly eliminated when they step foot onto campus? The Supreme Court famously observed that “[t]he college classroom with its surrounding environs is peculiarly the ‘marketplace of ideas.'” Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180 (1972). We would hope that QU would honor the special role of freedom of expression and association in a modern liberal education, rather than seek to restrict and censor student interaction and initiative.
QU’s hostility towards a free and independent press borders on the bizarre. The Chronicle reported on December 24, 2007, that you had made the following statements at a Student Government Association meeting the previous Wednesday:
So I guess the challenge for us now is how in today’s world we can really have a good discussion with the students about important topics, but not have it be a press conference to the world, where I have absolutely no control.
Why should I come to a meeting like this to discuss with the students sensitive topics [such as diversity] that are appropriate to discuss, but run the risk of that being reported, maybe accurately, or not accurately?
In addition, the September 12 memo from Vice President for Public Affairs Lynn Bushnell, which claims that a recent Yale Daily News editorial “abused” the “power of the press” by criticizing QU’s behavior in this situation, only provides more evidence of an unhealthy preference among QU administrators for censorship and silence rather than free and open debate.
If Quinnipiac University wishes to be a place where even the most fundamental American rights are subordinated to repressive university policies or the beliefs and preferences of university administrators, the university should explicitly state as much in its policies and literature so that students, faculty members, and the public understand that QU places these values above those enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. Since QU has not done so, however, FIRE requests that you clarify to SPJ that its members may interact with outside groups, in ways that do not violate QU policy, with impunity. Doing so will go a long way toward restoring the good name and reputation of Quinnipiac University.
FIRE hopes that this matter can be resolved amicably and swiftly, with fairness and common sense. We request a response by October 8, 2008.
Sincerely,
Adam Kissel

John L. Lahey



        Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_L._LaheyUpdated: 2017-04-28T00:33Z
      
John L. Lahey (born 1946) is the president of Quinnipiac University.[1]BiographyJohn Lahey was raised in the Riverdale section of the Bronx in New York City,[2] where he attended and graduated from Fordham Preparatory School in 1964. He earned his Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of Miami, bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Philosophy from the University of Dayton and a second master’s degree in Higher Education Administration from Columbia University.John L. Lahey was Executive Vice President of Marist College, where he served as Chief Operating Officer. He has been Quinnipiac’s president since 1987. Upon his arrival, Lahey initiated a strategic planning process, leading to the University’s unprecedented growth over the past two decades in enrollment, academic programs, reputation and physical plant.Lahey is a director of the United Illuminating Company, the Aristotle Corporation, the Yale-New Haven Hospital, and the Alliance for Gene Cancer Therapy. He is a member of the Council of the American Bar Association Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar. As Vice-Chairman of the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade Committee, he has devoted much of his time to educating the public about the historic implications of Ireland’s Great Hunger. In 1997, Lahey served as Grand Marshal of the Saint Patrick's Day Parade in New York City.[2] In 2011, Lahey was named Irish American of the Year by Irish America magazine.[3]As of April 14, 2017, John Lahey has announced his retirement at the end of the 2017-18 fiscal year at Quinnipiac University.

 Dr. John L. Lahey
President of Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut for over 25 years, Dr. John L. Lahey  is as dedicated to leadership and education as he is to his Irish ancestry. The Quinnipiac campus, its unprecedented Ireland’s Great Hunger Museum, and Dr. Lahey’s work with the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Parade Committee are all testaments to his exceptional commitment and vision.
Born and raised in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, Dr. Lahey has roots in Co. Clare on his mother’s side of the family, and in counties Cork and Kerry on his father’s. His paternal grandfather, a stonemason, emigrated from Knockglossmore, Co. Kerry to Canada, eventually settling in New York.
At the University of Dayton in Ohio, Lahey discovered a deep interest in philosophy, earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the field, and met his future wife, Judy, with whom he has two sons.  Following his time at Dayton, he went on to complete a PhD in philosophy at the University of Miami.
In 1977 he returned to New York and earned a second master’s degree, in academic administration, at Columbia University. He was hired by Marist University in Poughkeepsie, NY, where he became chief operating officer and executive vice president. At only 40 years of age, he became president of Quinnipiac.
When he started at Quinnipiac in 1987, it was still Quinnipiac College – a small, quiet commuter school with one campus, an endowment of $5 million and an application pool of 1,000. Today it has a student population of over 8,000, with close to 6,000 undergrads, 2,000 graduate students, and 500 enrolled in the law school, which was established under Lahey’s lead. The university now runs three campuses, has an endowment of $277 million, and applications for the incoming class exceed 19,000. Lahey has also had a hand in the establishment of the highly regarded Quinnipiac Polling Institute, and the Frank H. Netter, MD, School of Medicine, which will open in 2013.
The accomplishment closest to his Irish roots is the creation of Quinnipiac’s Ireland’s Great Hunger Museum, which seeks to commemorate the people who either died or fled Ireland during the famine, and to educate the public about An Gorta Mór.
The focal point of the museum is the extraordinary Lender Family Special Collection. Founded in 2000 following a donation from Marvin and Murray Lender, the collection contains 700 volumes, historic and contemporary texts, and an ever-growing number of works of art that portray or respond to the loss of more than 1.5 million Irish lives between 1845 and 1852. These include pieces by contemporary artists Padraic Reaney, John Behan, Rowan Gillespie, Glenna Goodacre, and period pieces by such artists as James Brenan and Jack  B. Yeats.
Away from Quinnipiac’s campus, Dr. Lahey is a director of the United Illuminating Company, Independence Holding Company, Yale-New Haven Hospital and Alliance for Cancer Gene Therapy. In addition, he is vice chairman of the New York City St. Patrick’s Day Committee and has been involved with the committee for over 25 years. In 1997, he was honored with the role of Grand Marshal.

Once in the United States or what would become Canada, these immigrants quickly contributed to the ongoing settling and industrialization processes. The largest influx of Irish settlers occurred with  Great Potato Famine of the late 1840s.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.

Quinnipiac University President John L. Lahey earned almost $3.8 million in 2012, the second-highest compensation of any private U.S. university president, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.



Most of that income, $2.76 million, was the result of Lahey’s becoming fully vested in his retirement plan after 25 years leading the growing university in Hamden, according to Quinnipiac spokeswoman Lynn Bushnell. His base pay was $980,000, $42,500 more than in 2011, the Chronicle reported.



Lahey’s 2012 earnings, as reported on Internal Revenue Service Form 990, were exceeded only by those of Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, who earned $7.1 million. The median pay was just under $400,000 for 537 current and former presidents, reported the Chronicle, based in Washington, D.C.



“In 2012, after completing 25 years as president, Dr. Lahey became fully vested in his retirement plan,” Bushnell said in an emailed statement. “In keeping with IRS rules, he was required to report the full amount and pay the full tax on a retirement plan that will be paid out over 17 or more years after his retirement. The university has never deferred compensation for any of its executives, including the president.”

The Chronicle did not include deferred compensation in its totals, but listed an additional $22,500 in deferred pay for Lahey. Told of the Chronicle’s figures, Bushnell maintained that Quinnipiac does not award deferred compensation.



A request for an interview with Lahey was denied.



“The university adheres to the highest standards of corporate governance in establishing executive compensation for all senior-level officers,” Bushnell wrote. “Compensation levels are set by the personnel committee of the Board of Trustees and are determined after reviewing compensation levels at comparable institutions. An independent compensation firm validates the list of appropriate peer institutions. The personnel committee sets salaries with an eye to attracting and retaining highly qualified and highly motivated executives, based on an annual review of agreed-upon goals.”



According to the Chronicle, Lahey was paid $3.08 million more than the next highest-paid president of a similar university, Paul G. Gaffney II of Monmouth University in New Jersey.



Former Yale President Richard C. Levin earned more than $1.37 million in 2012, the last year figures were available, to place him 10th on the list. The full list can be found at http://chronicle.com/compensation.



Jack Stripling, senior reporter of the Chronicle, said Lahey’s 2012 earnings were a one-year “anomalous payout” and not representative of his annual salary. Lahey’s total compensation in 2011 was $1.18 million and his base pay has risen from $746,043 in 2008 to 2012’s $980,000.



Formerly a vice president at Marist College, Lahey has overseen a massive expansion at Quinnipiac since he was named president in 1987. The university has added schools of law, medicine and social work and added campuses on York Hill in Hamden and in North Haven to its original Mount Carmel campus.



While many universities have expanded over the last 25 years, as have their executive salaries, Stripling said it’s unusual for one president to stay in office that long.



“I think longevity makes a difference. He’s well outside of the norm in that regard,” Stripling said.



Tuition at Quinnipiac is $38,000 and Lahey’s ratio of pay to tuition is “way out on the edge of the norm relative to this measure,” Stripling said. It takes 98.9 students paying full tuition to pay Lahey’s 2012 compensation, a ratio in the 100th percentile of university and college presidents.



Lahey’s compensation is also high when compared with Quinnipiac’s $245.3 million in expenses, according to the Chronicle. However, Stripling said, “In my experience, compensation for college presidents can be a very significant symbolic issue but, when looked at in the context of a college’s budget, there’s not much evidence to suggest that ... tuition rates are driven by the compensation of the college president.”



Lahey’s base pay of $980,000 was 7.8 times that of full professors’ median salary of $125,900, ranking in the 99th percentile. 



Three other Quinnipiac officials earned more than $500,000 in 2012, according to the Chronicle’s report: Patrick Healy, senior vice president for finance; Mark Thompson, senior vice president for academic and student affairs; and Donald Weinbach, vice president for development and alumni affairs.



Earnings of other presidents of private colleges in Connecticut include:



• James F. Jones Jr., Trinity College, $1.12 million



• Walter Harrison, University of Hartford, $1.02 million



• Michael S. Roth, Wesleyan University, $693,607



• John J. Petillo, Sacred Heart University, $558 ,057



• Leo I. Higdon Jr., Connecticut College, $418,916



• The Rev. Jeffrey P. Von Arx, Fairfield University, $361,461.



Among public universities, the Chronicle listed University of Connecticut President Susan Herbst at $550,000 for 2013, or 35th.

Quinnipiac president John L. Lahey will open the groundbreaking Ireland's Great Hunger Museum in Hamden, Connecticut this Friday.Gale Zucker


The crisis moment in our collective history, the year zero through which our past and our present must always travel, is 1847.
Now Quinnipiac University in Hamden Connecticut is set to unveil the first Great Hunger museum which shows the history of that terrible erathrough art and artifacts.
The legacy of Black 47, as it came to be called, is still being felt in myriad of ways inIrish society and culture and its shadow has played out in our history in ways that we are still only beginning to apprehend.
Growing up in the Bronx, Quinnipiac University President Dr. John Lahey, 65, first heard about the Irish Faminethe way most people still do in the United States – by word of mouth. As a boy in the Irish section of Riverdale, he was told that the Irish had been lazy and foolish to have allowed themselves to become so dependent on one crop, the potato.
What he didn’t know at the time was that this version of events was nonsense. The truth was that there were plenty of crops and alternative food supplies in Ireland during the famine, and that it was the economic policies of the ruling British government of the period that led to the mass starvations.
When he was invited to become grand marshal of the St. Patrick’s Day Parade in New York City in 1997, Lahey took the opportunity to research the famine in detail. What he discovered changed his life and his whole outlook on Irish history.
“My awakening with respect to Ireland’s Great Hunger came in 1996 when I read Christine Kinealy’s This Great Calamity,” he tells the Irish Voice.
“I grew up in Riverdale. My father’s father was born in Ireland and left as a kid. Growing up I heard references to the potato famine as it was called back then. But my family didn’t talk about it other than in vague ways as a dark period in Ireland’s history.”
The famine was the reason why there were so many Irish in America, he discovered.  But in his home it wasn’t spoken of at all.
“I had the sense that Irish Americans were embarrassed by it. They had possibly internalized some guilt associated with it. It was not until I read Kinealy’s book that I began to engage,” Laheyrecalls.
“Coincidentally around the same time, I was approached by the St. Patrick’s Day Parade Committee to be grand marshal in 1997. That was also the 150th anniversary of the famine. By that time the Irish government andIrish Americanshere were finally starting to acknowledge the tragedy, it’s causes and consequences, and memorials were being commissioned and new historical studies were being released.”
The time was finally right, so Lahey set about researching the calamity. What he discovered was that Anglo Irish historians had written the story of the Great Hunger in its immediate aftermath and they had decided where to pin the blame. In the process they played down their own responsibility and vowed they’d done all they could to alleviate the suffering.
“Well, it turns out that the Anglo Irish quite consciously took advantage of the crisis to enact land reform and to tighten their grip on Ireland. The takeaway for me from Christine’s book was that I had a greater sense of the consequences and the magnitude of what had happened in Ireland,” Lahey says.
“This was an avoidable tragedy. More than one million people didn’t have to die; two million didn’t have to emigrate.”
What Lahey discovered was that there had been a potato crop failure. The Irish were certainly dependent on the crop, but the root causes of their dependency went further back to the Cromwellian period and their forcible removal from land in the northeast in particular.
By 1852 the Irish population was cut in half; by 1900 they were cut in three quarters. During the famine the British government never closed the ports or reduced the tariffs.
Instead they shipped out food that could have saved the starving. They used none of the resources of the then wealthiest nation on earth to come to Ireland’s aid.
“When I was asked to be grand marshal I discovered that most of the previous ones had been born in Ireland and had talked about their times there. I guess it was the combination of the educator in me and the fact that I was second generation Irish that I decided to make the theme of that year’s parade the Great Hunger,” Lahey recalls.
The easiest thing about being grand marshal,Lahey says, is leading the parade up Fifth Avenue. The more challenging task was that every Irish organization in New York from January 1 onward wanted him to come to their dinner dance all the way to March 17.
“I attended about 40 or so to talk about the Great Hunger. Then for the first time ever at noon we stopped the parade for a minute’s silence to commemorate those lives impacted,” Lahey says.
The famine held back Ireland for 150 years, Lahey says. The country made little progress from the Great Hunger and the agrarian undeveloped country it was. It missed almost the entire Industrial Revolution. It really didn’t begin to emerge as a growing country with a growing economy until the 1980s and ‘90s with the electronic age.
“The effect on Ireland was not just theGreat Hunger years from 1845 to 1852. Thereafter anyone with ambition and talent knew they had to leave to achieve their goals,” Lahey says.
“There was a psychological aspect to it too. I think the Irish internalized the experience. Many of them accepted the narrative the British government told them -- they were lazy, they reproduced too much, they drank, and they were irresponsible. I had no idea of the true magnitude of the famine, how it set back the country’s growth in all areas.”
With the new museum at Quinnipiac his ambition is clear.
“I hope to educate people about the high quality of Irish art. I strongly think the Irish haven’t been given their due in the field of the visual arts. They have in theater, literature, and music, but they also had some great artists in the 19th and 20th centuries,” Lahey feels.
Principled truth tellers aren’t always welcomed with open arms anywhere, especially if they have come to tell hard truths which the famine museum necessitates. The Irish have always known this, and the British have always monitored our statements for centuries.
“When I was announced as grand marshal in December 1996 the ambassador from London took a few shots at me, saying that I was trying to rewrite history,” Laheyreveals.
“Parade officials also had some discussions with me to ask if we really wanted the Great Hunger to be the theme of the parade, since it was controversial. But they got on board quickly.”


Lahey had terrific support along the way, he adds. “The real vision and drive behind this museum, I’m delighted to say, comes from the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland,” Lahey reveals.
Murray Lender, chairman of Quinnipiac’s Board of Trustees (who sadly passed away in March) heard Lahey give talks on the Great Hunger while he was grand marshal, and told Laheyhe wanted to give the university a gift to provide a special room in the library at Quinnipiac dedicated to the Great Hunger.
“He told me, ‘I grew up in New Haven and I had a lot of Irish friends and I never heard a word about the famine.’ He was very forceful about saying it needed to be told and he underwrote it.”
The famine was an avoidable tragedy, Lahey concludes. The potato crop failure was not the fault of the British government and there would have been some deaths from it. But it didn’t have to become a great calamity.
The new museum will record that underline and commemorate it.
“A lot of Irish and Irish Americanartists and supporters helped to make this day possible, but without the support of a son of a Jewish immigrant from Poland who saw parallels in our experience we wouldn’t be there on Friday to dedicate this new facility. That’s a proof of how important this story is to all immigrants,” Laheysays.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
