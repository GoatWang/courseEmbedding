P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.02      Net Money Flow ($)  81,299    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

Changyou.com ltd operates online games, primarily massively multiplayer online games, in China.[2] Originally an internal division of Chinese Internet company Sohu, Changyou was spun off and went public in 2009.[3] The company claims it was operating independently of Sohu as early as 2007.[4]
Some of its games derive revenue from the sale of virtual goods,[5] and many are licensed rather than developed in-house.[6] Such deals have helped its roster of MMORPGs swell from two in 2009[7] to nearly a dozen as of 2014.[8]
C. 2009, its most popular game may have been the MMO Tian Long Ba Bu (Chinese: 天龙八部),[9] which translated means "Novel of Eight Demigods".[4] Some games in its portfolio are available to play outside of China in countries including Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States,[10] and Vietnam.
In 2011, the company purchased nearly 70% of a browser games maker, 7Road.[11]

Changyou.com ltd operates online games, primarily massively multiplayer online games, in China.[2] Originally an internal division of Chinese Internet company Sohu, Changyou was spun off and went public in 2009.[3] The company claims it was operating independently of Sohu as early as 2007.[4]
Some of its games derive revenue from the sale of virtual goods,[5] and many are licensed rather than developed in-house.[6] Such deals have helped its roster of MMORPGs swell from two in 2009[7] to nearly a dozen as of 2014.[8]
C. 2009, its most popular game may have been the MMO Tian Long Ba Bu (Chinese: 天龙八部),[9] which translated means "Novel of Eight Demigods".[4] Some games in its portfolio are available to play outside of China in countries including Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States,[10] and Vietnam.
In 2011, the company purchased nearly 70% of a browser games maker, 7Road.[11]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
