Nomad Foods Europe is owned by Nomad Foods, a US listed company, whose goal is to build a global portfolio of best in class food companies and brands within the frozen category and across the broader food sector. 
Our portfolio of market leading brands includes Birds Eye, iglo and Findus which are synonymous with frozen food and offer consumers great tasting, easy-to-prepare food that is nutritious and good value. Find out more about our brands here.

Hungry For The Nomad Foods IPO? - Nomad Foods Ltd. (NYSE:NOMD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Hungry For The Nomad Foods IPO?Dec. 8.15 | About: Nomad Foods (NOMD) Nicholas Durante Research analyst, long/short equity, Growth, portfolio strategySummaryNomad Foods filed for an IPO with an offer amount over $1.6 billion.Their product lines have established strong brand recognition in the UK, Germany, and Italy.They have made some heavy acquisitions recently to expand their product line and footprint.A leader in distributing and manufacturing branded frozen foods in Weston Europe, Nomad Foods (OTCPK:NOMHF) has a 25% market share in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy. In these countries Nomad Foods is sold through grocery retailers under the brands, "Birds Eye," "Iglo," and "Findus." Some of their competitors include Dr. Oetker, McCain, and Nestlé.

Some notes on the company and IPO...
They are a big player. In the United Kingdom, Germany, and Italy, Nomad Foods' brands are household names. A 2014 market research study showed that spontaneous brand awareness for Nomad Foods products in those three countries were 87%, 78%, and 93%.
There is still plenty of room for growth. As big as the company is, there is still significant growth opportunities for Nomad Foods. Strategic acquisitions will help the company grow into newer geographic markets, while expanding outside of just the frozen food category will help them capture a bigger piece of the sector.

Source: Nomad Foods' F-1
They are not profitable. For the year 2014, Nomad Foods had an operating margin of 15%, but ending up taking a loss of €109.1 million. If you take a look throughout all their years you will see a positive operating margin and a negative net margin due to their net finance costs, which are made up of a considerable amount of capitalized interest.

But they do have cash. Nomad Foods should not have any problems meeting their short-term obligation, especially considering their cash and cash equivalents exceeded their total current liabilities ending September 30. There is some long-term debt on the books which is cutting into them turning a positive net margin, however they are well positioned enough to pay down that debt to a more manageable level.

Source: Nomad Foods' F-1
They're all about acquisitions. Nomad Foods is built on acquisitions and that is not a game they want to slow down on. After completing the acquisition of Iglo Foods for €2.6 billion in June, the company wasted no time in picking up Findus Sverige AB for £500 million last month. It is likely we will see more acquisitions in the future funded by combinations of cash, debt, and equity.
This isn't there first time on the public markets. This IPO is just a move to the NYSE. Currently they trade OTC under OTCPK:NOMHF and on the London Stock Exchange under NHL with a market cap of over 2 billion. While the stock is up since its IPO in April of 2014, it has been tumbled down almost 50% since July.
Conclusion
I am not sure how much of a stir this IPO will make on the NYSE. It's a rather unknown company in North America and frozen foods might not motivate the investor base. Nomad Foods seems to be ambitious in their acquisition strategy but that always raises concerns, especially when moving into newer markets facing different regulation, economic, and cultural issues.
