Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Advanced genomic testing




Every cancer, like every patient, is different. Genomic tumor assessments help identify the DNA alterations that are driving the growth of a particular tumor. As we understand more about these gene mutations, we are better able to provide cancer treatment therapies that specifically target changes in the tumor's genomic profile. Information about genomic changes that are unique to your individual cancer may help us determine treatments that may be appropriate for you. It's the promise of precision cancer treatment—a focus on the individual tumor in the individual patient.
Since genomic testing may not be right for every patient, your oncologist will help determine if you are a good candidate for the assessments. 
Evolution of care
For centuries, scientists have been searching for better ways to treat cancer. The development of radiation therapy in the early 1900s and chemotherapy in the 1940s were two milestones. But both had significant drawbacks.
Early chemotherapy drugs lacked the selective capacity to distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells, resulting in toxic and sometimes intolerable side effects for patients. Radiation therapy initially was shown to cause cancer in addition to treating it.
Thanks to medical advances, both therapies have become more targeted, and researchers have found ways to minimize side effects. Today, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are considered the standard of care in treating cancer patients, helping millions of survivors to live longer.
The future is here
But these therapies still have limitations. For example, two patients displaying symptoms and imaging results associated with a certain cancer might be prescribed the same chemotherapy regimen, only to experience drastically different outcomes. Why? Because the root cause of their disease and the treatment needed are different, as is the molecular makeup of their individual tumor.
The Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, marked a dramatic shift in the understanding of cancer and other diseases. After 13 years, researchers mapped the entire human genetic code, discovering that every human cell is packed with an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 genes. Researchers have used the discoveries to link dozens of diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and inherited colon cancer, to specific genes.
In the case of cancer, researchers have discovered that two genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are associated with breast and ovarian cancers. Likewise, researchers have developed a drug specifically to treat breast cancers that demonstrate an overproduction of the protein HER2. Such drugs, now standard in the treatment of breast, ovarian, lung and some other cancers, target inherited genetic abnormalities identified through genetic tests, which detect mutations passed down from one generation to the next. 
In recent years, the medical world has taken the advancements one step further, with genomic tests of the cancer itself. These even more targeted assessments study the DNA profile of the patient’s tumor, searching for genetic abnormalities that can be matched to a particular drug therapy that may not have otherwise been considered. 
“This is an incredibly powerful, positive force in medical care. We were in the Dark Ages before this,” Dr. Maurie Markman, President of Medicine and Science at Cancer Treatment Centers of America® (CTCA), says of advanced genomic testing. “It is the tsunami on our shores, and it’s going to take over all of medicine. It is the future of cancer care, no question about it.”

Our Oncology Information Specialists are available 24 hours a day, every day of the year to listen, answer your questions, and help you decide if CTCA is right for you. Call us anytime at (888) 552-6760 or chat now.







Step 2: The insurance verification process
We'll obtain your insurance policy information and contact your insurance provider on your behalf to verify your benefits, which typically takes 24 to 48 hours. Then, we'll contact you to review the details of your insurance plan’s coverage.







Step 3: Scheduling an appointment
If your insurance plan works with CTCA and you're interested in coming to one of our hospitals for a consultation, we will schedule your initial appointment. We’ll coordinate your visit and handle all of the details for you to make the process as easy, stress-free and affordable as possible. If you are newly diagnosed and live within 100 miles of our Chicago hospital, you may be able to see a cancer specialist within as little as 24 hours.

We'll mail you out a personalized packet of information and an oncology nurse will call you at home to discuss your medical history and help address any questions or concerns you might have to ease your mind about what to expect in your first visit.







Step 5: Your 3-5 day evaluation
When you arrive, our doctors will review your medical records and healthy history, and perform a complete array of diagnostic tests and procedures. You'll also consult with various members of your care team. It typically takes 3-5 days to tailor a comprehensive treatment plan to your needs. With second opinions, our Tulsa and Philadelphia hospitals may be able to offer one-day evaluations.
