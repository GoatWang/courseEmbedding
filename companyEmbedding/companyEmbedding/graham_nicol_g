Graham Nicol - Wikipedia





















 






Graham Nicol

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Graham John Nicol ED (17 July 1907 – 28 September 1990) was an Australian politician.
He was born in Windsor, the son of pastoralist F. H. Nicol. He was an accountant, and served in World War II from 1940 to 1945; he was a prisoner of war of the Japanese in Timor and Java. On 14 August 1930 he had married Dorothy Williams, with whom he had two daughters. In 1958 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Council as a Liberal and Country Party member for Monash Province. He had held high office in the party as chairman of the Young Liberals and a member of the state executive, but he remained on the backbench throughout his parliamentary career. Nicol retired in 1976, and died in 1990.[1]

Bio
I joined Siebel Expert Services in the UK as a Configuration Specialist in 2000, specialising in script and configuration. With the release of Siebel 2000 (Siebel 6) I started to concentrate on Integration technologies, working with the first releases of the Siebel EAI technologies that are in use today. For the Siebel 7.0 release I was seconded to Siebel Development in San Mateo for a month where I worked with the Engineers refining and polishing the MQSeries Server Transport ready for release, and participated in the initial group sessions on a new "Application Network" initiative that eventually grew into UAN/UCM/UPM. As the Technical Lead for EAI within Expert Services I worked with a group of 15 other specialists, ensuring that we kept up to date with both technology and best practice enhancements. I also worked with a number of large customers during this tiem to develop their Audit requirements and solutions, providing Runtime Event based Read Audit three years before it was available in the main product.In 2005 I moved from Expert Services to Siebel Professional Services, although on my first day there the name changed to Oracle Consulting! I worked as a Solution Architect within the UK practice, still specialising in Integration, Audit, Business and Technical architectures but also providing Project and Programme management support to a number of projects and Sales support to the Consultign Sales teams.In 2008 I moved from Oracle Consulting to Product Management in order to assume responsibility for the Siebel Integration and Siebel Audit Trail functional areas within the Siebel Core Technology team. Until August 2011 this function has been associated with a traditional "waterfall" development methodology and I was responsible for Requirements Gathering, producing Market Requirements Documents (MRDs) and prioritizing defects for resolution through Fix Pack deliveries. Since August 2011 the department as a whole has begun to transition towards a Scrum based paradigm so many of the roles that I perform are evolving into the Product Owner function within the Scrum universe.
