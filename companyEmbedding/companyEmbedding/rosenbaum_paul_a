About this book




An observational study is an empiric investigation of the effects caused by a treatment, policy, or intervention in which it is not possible to assign subjects at random to treatment or control, as would be done in a controlled experiment. Observational studies are common in most fields that study the effects of treatments on people.The second edition of Observational Studies is about 50% longer than the first edition, with many new examples and methods. There are new chapters on nonadditive models for treatment effects (5) and planning observational studies     , and the chapter on coherence (9) has been extensively rewritten.Paul R. Rosenbaum is Robert G. Putzel Professor, Department of Statistics, The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He is a fellow of the American Statistical Association.

Reviews




"This second edition is about fifty percent larger than the original. The flavour is the same. The book provides a thoughtful discussion, at a mathematical and conceptual level, of what can and cannot be learned from observational studies."
ISI Short Book Reviews, Vol. 22/2, August 2002
 
 
From reviews of the First Edition:"A fascinating book which combines elegant theory with good practical advice on applications, including in-depth discussion of many interesting examples from diverse fields."Short Book Reviews of the International Statistical Institute"Observational Studies" will be extremely useful to researchers and graduate students in the biomedical and social sciences... The book is well written in an area where clarity is difficult... It will set a new standard for the analysis of observational studies."Journal of the American Statistical Association"Rosenbaum's text does a great job of merging the theoretical with the practical, and provides a nice resource for a broad range of researchers... Consultants and field researchers, particularly in public health, will appreciate the examples and discussion of different research designs."The American Statistician"Generously dispersed throughout the volume are fundamentally important, but seldom explicitly recognized, insights about the logic of research design. Virtually any reader will find much of value in this book, especially concerning design issues."Applied Psychological Measurement"In summary, Observational Studies is an excellent book. It should be widely and carefully read."Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics

Item Description: Springer-Verlag New York Inc., United States, 2010. Hardback. Book Condition: New. 2010 ed.. Language: English . Brand New Book. An observational study is an empiric investigation of effects caused by treatments when randomized experimentation is unethical or infeasible. Observational studies are common in most fields that study the effects of treatments on people, including medicine, economics, epidemiology, education, psychology, political science and sociology. The quality and strength of evidence provided by an observational study is determined largely by its design. Design of Observational Studies is both an introduction to statistical inference in observational studies and a detailed discussion of the principles that guide the design of observational studies. Design of Observational Studies is divided into four parts. Chapters 2, 3, and 5 of Part I cover concisely, in about one hundred pages, many of the ideas discussed in Rosenbaum s Observational Studies (also published by Springer) but in a less technical fashion. Part II discusses the practical aspects of using propensity scores and other tools to create a matched comparison that balances many covariates. Part II includes a chapter on matching in R.In Part III, the concept of design sensitivity is used to appraise the relative ability of competing designs to distinguish treatment effects from biases due to unmeasured covariates. Part IV discusses planning the analysis of an observational study, with particular reference to Sir Ronald Fisher s striking advice for observational studies, make your theories elaborate. The second edition of his book, Observational Studies, was published by Springer in 2002.  Bookseller Inventory # SPR9781441912121

About This BookAbout the AuthorsReviewsTable of Contents 

In the daily news and the scientific literature, we are faced with conflicting claims about the effects caused by some treatments, behaviors, and policies. A daily glass of wine prolongs life, or so we are told. Yet we are also told that alcohol can cause life-threatening cancer and that pregnant women should abstain from drinking. Some say that raising the minimum wage decreases inequality while others say it increases unemployment. Investigators once confidently claimed that hormone replacement therapy reduces the risk of heart disease but today investigators confidently claim it raises that risk. How should we study such questions?
Observation and Experiment is an introduction to causal inference from one of the field’s leading scholars. Using minimal mathematics and statistics, Paul Rosenbaum explains key concepts and methods through scientific examples that make complex ideas concrete and abstract principles accessible.
Some causal questions can be studied in randomized trials in which coin flips assign individuals to treatments. But because randomized trials are not always practical or ethical, many causal questions are investigated in nonrandomized observational studies. To illustrate, Rosenbaum draws examples from clinical medicine, economics, public health, epidemiology, clinical psychology, and psychiatry. Readers gain an understanding of the design and interpretation of randomized trials, the ways they differ from observational studies, and the techniques used to remove, investigate, and appraise bias in observational studies. Observation and Experiment is a valuable resource for anyone with a serious interest in the empirical study of human health, behavior, and well-being.

July 13: Liu Xiaobo and the Responsibility of Being Alive
The Chinese dissident and Nobel Peace Prize recipient Liu Xiaobo died today, a few short weeks after the Chinese government revealed that he was suffering from cancer that had progressed beyond treatment during his political imprisonment. The course of his life was forever altered by the Tiananmen Square demonstrations of 1989, and, as Perry Link notes at NYR Daily, Liu felt haunted by the “lost souls” of Tiananmen, “the aggrieved ghosts of students and workers alike whose ages would forever be the same as on the night they died.” His widow Liu Xia reports that he dedicated his Nobel Prize to them in 2010, as he’d done in 2003 after receiving an award from the Chinese Demo…

“I got out the SWR, mixed it up and put it in the spray bottles. The bullheads and decks were cleaned quickly. The guys were amazed! They had never seen anything cut the heavy oil so easily. SWR worked so well that I had a hard time to keep the guys from using it for all our cleaning needs. I look forward to seeing SWR more and more as I continue to working the Engine Rooms of the Merchant Marine.”

“We have been using SWR One for our cleaning needs at the school for the last two years. This includes everything from the windows to the Bilge area of our large diesel engine trainer. We always have excellent results on any surface where we use the SWR product. The initial product itself is extremely reasonable and also because of it’s wide application, it eliminates the need for purchasing multiple products for multiple cleaning tasks. I highly recommend the use of this product.”

“We have been using SWR One to remediate soils contaminated petroleum hydrocarbons and are very impressed with the effectiveness of your product. Also, the SWR One is effective in removing benzene, toluene, ethelbensene and xylene from soils and we are achieving concentrations less than the state required cleanup criteria. We couldn’t be more pleased with your product and it’s performance on this remediation project. We look forward to continuing to work with your product on other projects.”

“As participants in a recent SWR demonstration in Seattle, we witnessed efficiency and speed at which SWR acts on oil, grease and emulsifications. SWR appears to have a number of advantages over commonly used solvent and caustic based cleaners. As it will not emulsify oil and aids in their separation and recovery, these products can then be reclaimed and recycled, improving the quality of marine and industrial water discharges.”
