Continue reading the main story









Mr. Rufrano, 61, is the new chief executive and president of Cushman and Wakefield, a global real estate services firm whose majority owner is Exor S.p.A. of Italy.Mr. Rufrano, who was previously the chief executive of the Centro Properties Group of Australia, took the helm of Cushman and Wakefield on March 22, 2010, replacing Bruce E. Mosler, who is now the chairman of global brokerage.Q  How was your first year as C.E.O.?A It certainly has been intellectually challenging. I’ve had to understand the breadth of Cushman and Wakefield — which is 13,000 people in 60 countries and 230 offices. So getting into and understanding each of the regional businesses and then the major offices and how they perform services has taken some time this year. I think I’m there.The first day here, I put out a memo outlining what I’d be doing for the next 90 days. The first 30 I would spend in New York understanding all the financials and the global clientele. Then I outlined my trips for the next 30 days. In the last 30 days I would correlate what I found in the field and prepare a strategic plan. But actually I only spent two weeks here and six in the field.

Q  Did Bruce help you?A He helped me initially understand the structure of the company, personalities of the people, and how business opportunities shaped themselves. Continue reading the main story

Bruce has such good history at the company, and quite often we’ll talk about the business and what I think I know and what is really happening. As you know, I don’t come from the brokerage business. I had no problem as a C.E.O. coming in with the ex-C.E.O. being in a different position, which is highly unusual; in most companies they’re gone. So I think of this as we’re partners.Q  There’s been talk within the industry that you were brought in to burnish the company so it could eventually be sold off.A The reason I was brought in — and what my tour is — is to maximize the value of Cushman and Wakefield. It is really as simple as that. Exor has no plans to sell Cushman and Wakefield.

Q  Have there been many merger or acquisition overtures?A There has been over the years. It did eventually sell in ’07 to Exor. Their M.O. is to buy businesses and hold them long term. At some point Exor may want to reduce their position in Cushman. They own 73 percent; the employees own the rest.Q  A number of your key employees, though, have left.A In New York there have been two groups that have left for Jones Lang LaSalle: our capital markets group, and then our leasing group, more recently. They were fine people, but at times you agree to disagree. On a global basis we’ve added people.

Q  Last week, Exor released its financial results for 2010, which showed that Cushman and Wakefield earned $25.7 million on $1.8 billion in revenue, versus a $115.8 million loss in ’09.A Cushman reduced expenses nicely — kept them down in ’08, ’09 and going into 2010. Then the wind shifted; 2010 was a very good year for revenue. We had a good last half of the year, driven by capital markets and leasing, though every one of our five business lines had increases for the year. In 2008 and 2009 we let go about 17 or 18 percent of our work force. We are building back up.Q  Let’s talk about business in the New York market.A Leasing activity over all is up 61.9 percent over this time last year. One reason New York City has done so well is because it did not lose as many jobs as people expected. We’ve recovered 43 percent of the jobs that we lost since the end of ’09. Nationally, we recovered 14.5 percent. Our capital markets group had a very fair year. We had a number of transactions in the $40 million-to-$100 million range.

The asking rental rates for a Class A building in Midtown averaged $66.25 a square foot in the first quarter, up 21 percent from a year ago but 47 percent below the ’08 first quarter.Q  Is there more foreign interest?A There’s clearly more capital from off shore that would like to invest in New York. A group called Afire — the Association of Foreign Investors in Real Estate — identified the five locations around the globe that they wanted to invest in. New York was No. 1, followed by Washington, London, Paris and Tokyo. What do they want to own? These office buildings, and they will pay high prices for them.Q  Speaking of big office buildings, Cushman is part of the leasing team for One World Trade Center. What’s the status?A The building is well positioned for large-space users. There’s a commitment for 200,000 square feet from Beijing Vantone, and the other major tenant that’s announced but hasn’t signed yet is Condé Nast.

 Correction: April 10, 2011  
The 30-Minute Interview last Sunday about Glenn J. Rufrano, the chief   executive of Cushman and Wakefield, misstated the amount of space   leased by Beijing Vantone at One World Trade Center. It is 200,000   square feet, not 1.25 million square feet, which represents the total   amount committed to by Beijing Vantone and another prospective tenant,   Condé Nast.

Glenn Rufrano goes back to his old firm

 New York, NY– November 13, 2013– Glenn J. Rufrano, the former CEO of Cushman & Wakefield who left the company abruptly in June this year, has rejoined his former firm.
 GLENN RUFRANO
The 30-year industry veteran has been named chairman and CEO at O’Connor Capital Partners, the privately-owned real estate investment, development and management firm.
Rufrano, who was a founding partner of predecessor The O’Connor Group and who has served as a board member since 2010, will assume his new position effective immediately.  In addition, he has acquired a full partnership stake in the firm.
Bill O’Connor, president & COO of O’Connor Capital Partners said, “We are thrilled to have Glenn rejoin our company.  Not only does he possess a deep knowledge of our firm and our industry, but he also shares a common set of values and beliefs that has served the company well since its founding 30-plus years ago.”
Best known for his past leadership in the retail real estate sector,  Rufrano began his career with Landauer Associates.  His previous 17-year tenure with The O’Connor Group, which began in 1983, culminated with his positions as president and COO and as co-chairman of The Peabody Group, which was sponsored jointly with J.P Morgan.
Between 2000 and 2007 he was CEO of New Plan Excel Realty Trust Inc., and subsequently he led Australian-based Centro Properties Group as its CEO.  In 2010, Rufrano was named CEO of Cushman & Wakefield, a position he held until earlier this year.
In addition to his past corporate executive roles, Rufrano formerly served on the boards of Trizec Properties, Inc., Criimi Mae, Inc. and General Growth Properties.
He currently serves on the Board of Directors of Ventas, a leading healthcare real estate investment trust, and also on the not-for-profit health and social services agency, New Alternatives for Children.
He is on the advisory boards of New York University’s Real Estate Institute and Baruch College and is a trustee and member of the International Council of Shopping Centers.  He received his bachelor’s degree in Business Administration from Rutgers University and his MSc in Management and Real Estate from Florida International University.
Rufrano’s return to a chief executive role at O’Connor Capital Partners comes as the firm is growing and increasing its presence in both the retail and residential sectors.  The firm currently has approximately $3.5 billion of assets under management.
The retail platform currently manages approximately 14 million square feet of properties including three million square feet in Mexico.  Over the past three years, the firm has invested $1.7 billion gross in retail properties ranging from high street retail to Class A malls.  Its most recent high-profile investment came earlier this year when it acquired a large joint venture interest in a portfolio of six malls owned in partnership with the Westfield Group.
On the residential front, the firm currently oversees investment in approximately 8,000 multifamily units.  Over the past three years, O’Connor Capital Partners has invested $500 million gross in residential development with 700 units currently under construction.  The firm is slated to open two new multifamily rental projects this month with the 188-unit Maximilian in Long Island City and the 420-unit Atmark in Cambridge, MA.
Rufrano joins Bill O’Connor and a long established senior executive team featuring former General Growth Properties executive Joel Bayer as head of the retail team and Brian Fallon as head of development and residential product.
“I am very excited about joining O’Connor Capital Partners full-time as both CEO and a partner,” said  Rufrano.  “This is a firm with a proud legacy, an extremely strong management team and a great future.”

American Realty Capital Properties Announces Appointment of Glenn J. Rufrano as Chief Executive Officer
        																																																		
              

          ARCP Also Announces Plans to Reconstitute the Board of Directors

PHOENIX, March 10, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- American Realty Capital Properties, Inc. ("ARCP," "the Company") (NASDAQ:    ARCP) today announced that the Board of Directors has named Glenn J. Rufrano Chief Executive Officer effective April 1, 2015.  Mr. Rufrano will bring to ARCP more than 30 years of experience growing and creating shareholder value in the commercial real estate industry. 













                American Reality Capital Properties ("ARCP") is a leading, self-managed commercial real estate investment trust focused on acquiring and owning single tenant freestanding commercial properties subject to net leases with high credit quality tenants.
              

 
 



Mr. Rufrano succeeds William Stanley, who has held the position on an interim basis since December 2014. Mr. Stanley will continue as interim Chairman of the Board until the Board completes its search for a Non-Executive Chairman. 
"Glenn's long and successful track record makes him the ideal individual to lead ARCP and set it on a course for long-term growth and value creation," said Thomas Andruskevich, Interim Lead Independent Director. "Glenn is well known and well regarded for his ability to lead companies through complex situations and turbulent environments. His leadership, combined with ARCP's diverse real estate assets with long-term, net leases, a seasoned acquisition and property management team, and a recognized asset management and distribution platform, position the Company for a new phase of growth and development. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Bill Stanley for the outstanding work he has done to stabilize the Company as interim CEO."
Mr. Rufrano commented: "ARCP is a young company, grown rapidly, which now requires a sound business path. I look forward to meeting the management team, thoroughly analyzing the assets and reviewing the details of the balance sheet while at the same time seeking thoughts from the institutional investor community. Once complete, we will organize a strategic plan and begin execution to maximize the value of the core REIT assets, Cole Capital and the enterprise."
Throughout his career, Mr. Rufrano has strengthened each of the organizations he has led. Under his leadership, New Plan Excel Realty Trust, Centro Global Property Group and Cushman & Wakefield each underwent structural changes leading to enhanced growth at each.  During his tenure at New Plan, the company's stock price nearly tripled. The substantial value creation was a product of the growth prospects Mr. Rufrano saw in New Plan and the decisive actions he took to reposition the business, including overhauling the management team, the board of directors, and the firm's strategy and asset base, and selling off $1.5 billion in non-core assets to focus on shopping centers. New Plan was subsequently sold to Centro.
As CEO of Centro, Mr. Rufrano successfully led the company through the global financial crisis. During this period, Mr. Rufrano oversaw a vital financial restructuring exercise to refinance Centro's debt. Centro emerged from a point of near-collapse to a stable position. As President and CEO of Cushman & Wakefield, he helped revitalize the world's largest privately held commercial real estate services firm following the financial crisis. 
Mr. Rufrano joins ARCP from O'Connor Capital Partners, a real estate investment firm specializing in retail and multifamily residential properties, where he had been Chairman and CEO since 2013. 
He is currently a member of the Board of Directors of Ventas, Inc. and is a trustee of the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC). He was previously a director of General Growth Properties.
Board ReconstitutionWith the restatement of the Company's financial statements completed, the Company expecting to file its 2014 10-K by the end of March and the appointment of a new CEO, Leslie Michelson and Governor Edward Rendell have decided that it is the right time for them to step down from the Board effective April 1, 2015 to make way for new directors. The Board thanks Mr. Michelson and Governor Rendell for their years of service and, in particular, their contributions as members of the Audit Committee in connection with the investigation and restatement.
The Board is in the process of recruiting a new non-executive Chairman and two other new independent directors, which will result in a seven-member Board. The decision about re-nomination of the other existing directors for election at the 2015 annual meeting will be made by the disinterested members of the reconstituted Board.
About ARCPARCP is a leading, self-managed commercial real estate investment trust ("REIT") focused on investing in single tenant freestanding commercial properties subject to net leases with high credit quality tenants. ARCP owns approximately 4,400 properties totaling 99.1 million square feet of leasable space. Additionally, ARCP acquires and manages assets on behalf of the Cole Capital® non-traded REITs, managing nearly $40 billion of high-quality real estate located in 49 states, as well as Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and Canada.

NEW YORK, Nov. 13, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Glenn J. Rufrano, a leading commercial real estate industry executive for the past three decades, is returning to O'Connor Capital Partners as Chairman & CEO.  The privately-owned, independent real estate investment, development and management firm today announced that Mr. Rufrano, who was a founding partner of predecessor The O'Connor Group and who has served as a board member since 2010, will assume his new position effective immediately.  In addition, he has acquired a full partnership stake in the firm.  
Bill O'Connor, President & COO of O'Connor Capital Partners notes, "We are thrilled to have Glenn rejoin our company.  Not only does he possess a deep knowledge of our firm and our industry, but he also shares a common set of values and beliefs that has served the company well since its founding 30-plus years ago."
Best known for his past leadership in the retail real estate sector, Mr. Rufrano began his career with Landauer Associates.  His previous 17-year tenure with The O'Connor Group, which began in 1983, culminated with his positions as President and COO and as Co-Chairman of The Peabody Group, which was sponsored jointly with J.P Morgan.  Between 2000 and 2007 he was CEO of New Plan Excel Realty Trust Inc., and subsequently he led Australian-based Centro Properties Group as its CEO.  In 2010, Mr. Rufrano was named CEO of Cushman & Wakefield, a position he held until earlier this year. 
In addition to his past corporate executive roles, Mr. Rufrano formerly served on the boards of Trizec Properties, Inc., Criimi Mae, Inc. and General Growth Properties.  He currently serves on the Board of Directors of Ventas, a leading healthcare real estate investment trust, and also on the not-for-profit health and social services agency, New Alternatives for Children.  He is on the advisory boards of New York University's Real Estate Institute and Baruch College and is a trustee and member of the International Council of Shopping Centers.  He received his bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Rutgers University and his MSc in Management and Real Estate from Florida International University.
Mr. Rufrano's return to a chief executive role at O'Connor Capital Partners comes as the firm is growing and increasing its presence in both the retail and residential sectors.  The firm currently has approximately $3.5 billion of assets under management.  The retail platform currently manages approximately 14 million square feet of properties including three million square feet in Mexico.  Over the past three years, the firm has invested $1.7 billion gross in retail properties ranging from high street retail to Class A malls.  Its most recent high-profile investment came earlier this year when it acquired a large joint venture interest in a portfolio of six malls owned in partnership with the Westfield Group.  
On the residential front, the firm currently oversees investment in approximately 8,000 multifamily units.  Over the past three years, O'Connor Capital Partners has invested $500 million gross in residential development with 700 units currently under construction.  The firm is slated to open two new multifamily rental projects this month with the 188-unit Maximilian in Long Island City and the 420-unit Atmark in Cambridge, MA.
Mr. Rufrano joins Bill O'Connor and a long established senior executive team featuring former General Growth Properties executive Joel Bayer as head of the retail team and Brian Fallon as head of development and residential product.  
"I am very excited about joining O'Connor Capital Partners full-time as both CEO and a partner," said Mr. Rufrano.  "This is a firm with a proud legacy, an extremely strong management team and a great future."
