FP IV will continue Francisco Partners’ focus on middle market technology companies in the U.S., Europe, and Israel targeting transaction values between $50 million and $2 billion while Agility will target sub $50 million investments.
“We are incredibly appreciative and humbled by the support of our existing limited partners who stepped forward as the investors in the Agility Fund,” said Deb. “Our team is excited by the opportunity and additional flexibility presented.”
