FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Vivint Inc. is one of the largest home security companies in North America and currently provides services to over one million customers. Last year, Vivint was voted Best Product of 2015 by PC Magazine. The company offers great warranties and remote monitoring, but charges higher-than-average rates and requires customers to sign into a lengthy contract.

The Good

Nationwide availability
Multiple equipment options and automation features
Lifetime warranty
Remote access via mobile app

Nationwide Availability
Vivint is one of the few home security companies that is truly available in all 50 states, so customers all around the nation have access to its products and services.
Multiple Equipment Options and Automation Features
With Vivint’s base security package, customers receive a touch screen control panel, a smoke detector, a door/window sensor, a motion detector, and a key fob. The key fob can be used to arm or disarm the system without having to enter the home. Additional equipment is also available, including recessed door sensors, glass break detectors, flood/freeze sensors, carbon monoxide detectors, tilt sensors, small appliance controls, and panic pendants. For detailed equipment and package information, check out the Equipment Overview section below.
Lifetime Warranty
Vivint offers some of the most advanced equipment in the industry and is consistently pushing the boundaries of what home security can accomplish. The company offers a lifetime equipment warranty on all of its home security and home automation devices, which covers both defective parts and normal wear and tear. This warranty applies for as long as you are a paying Vivint customer.
Remote Access via Mobile App
The Vivint Sky mobile app, which is available for free download on Apple and Android devices, allows customers to arm and disarm their security system, view and record live video feeds, lock and unlock doors, control the temperature of their home, and more. The application also integrates voice control capabilities using Amazon Echo.

The Bad

Lengthy contract
Expensive rates
Reports of poor customer service

Lengthy Contract
Vivint’s minimum home security contract is set at 60months (5 years), which is longer than the industry average of 3 years. If a customer would like to end their contract with Vivint before the term is over, they are required to pay off the remaining contract balance in full. For more information on the company’s contracts, take a look at the Contract Details section below.
Expensive Rates
Monthly monitoring rates start at $39.99 per month and go up from there. There are several competing home security companies that do not charge any upfront fees and have lower monthly rates.
Reports of Poor Customer Service
According to reviews from customers posted here on our site, Vivint customer complaints typically center around sales and customer service. Customers have accused Vivint representatives of employing deceptive sales tactics and not being able to answer questions satisfactorily. Several customers have mentioned Vivint’s poor customer service, specifically in regards to billing practices, phone support, and technician response. Vivint currently ranks in the bottom 10% in user review scores of all home security companies we have reviewed. Over 600+ people have shared their experience here with Vivint and on average, those people have said their experience was roughly a 3/10.

The Bottom Line
If you’re looking for a home security company that offers several automation features and remote system control, Vivint is a good option to consider. However, keep in mind that the company’s contract is lengthy and its rates are higher than many of its competitors. The big thing to watch out for with Vivint are the customer reviews. With so many of them being negative, it’s worth taking the time to research other providers that have a much more positive customer sentiment. Companies like Frontpoint Security, Protect America, and SimpliSafe.

Sales misrepresentation. Wasn’t informed of cancellation procedure after filling contract. They continued to charge me the monthly fee and wrote off the equipment and now want to charge me both the fees and equipment. After reviewing Vivint in several states, this seems to be one of the biggest issues. They’ve been charged for this practice in several states. They also violated state law by not registering with the DPS in Texas for proper identification.

I have been their customer for over 3 years and paid over $50 per month.  I called them because I don’t really used all the equipment and plus I wanted to lower the bill.  I sent all of the equipment and they still taking out $50!  So I closed my account!  They will not work with you, tried calling them and they just keep transferring to another agent after agent…they really don’t know what they are doing.  Do not go with Vivint!
I wrote them 4 cancellation letters also…still not doing anything.

A Vivent person came by my house, identified himself as a Supervisor, said he was moving to Utah to work in their home office.  He advised me that I was eligible for a Senior Rate with no extension of contract.  Well it did extend my contract for 18 months as I learned later.  I was going with ATT and called Vivent to check on getting it disconnected.  Spoke with a young lady by the name of Staley and her words were, ” You are out of contract”.  They denied this when I called back to disconnect. I am not happy since I am on a fixed income.

Our salesperson was very intrusive and pushy.  The first mistake was him showing up at our home at 7pm. Since we were already searching for a security system, and our neighbors gave him recommendations on our community Facebook page,  we decided to give him the benefit of the doubt. We signed and agreed to choose Vivent, since the deal seemed reasonable. However if its too good to be true then it usually is! In hindsight,  our salesman was dishonest and witheld important information regarding the contract/ loan.
What really raised suspicion is that the install guy just so happened to “be in the area” and was able to come  and “install right away.” Most places, you have to schedule right? I truly believe that the install guy was probably following the salesman around waiting on a sale.
During the time of the installation,  I decided to research the company. I know that you’ll see good/ bad reviews with most companies but Vivint was HORRIBLE!! Aside from checking the reviews on their Facebook page,  they had bad reviews with BBB, Yelp,  Rip off report, and even 20/20 launched an investigation on the company!!!!
At this point it was 9 at night,  we had the install guy stop everything and come back the next day.  I immediately called to cancel our “3 day trial” in which I’m hoping we’ll get our money refunded to us..contrary to what the reviews state. Thankfully we got out before we were locked into this nightmare of a company.
Please train your salespeople to properly and honestly explained the contract and other perks. Also please please have them to stop using scare tactics in order to make sales.  It’s not good for a business.

My experience has been awful!  I upgraded after having Vivint for a very long time and negotiated my upgrade to a set dollar amount.  Much to my surprise Vivint has been billing me excessive amounts that should have been included when I negotiated the original deal.  My bank account has been hit with an excess of over $400.00!  I have requested credits with your loyalty department and all agree that these charges should not be charged.  However I never get a credit.  I have been on the phone 4 times in a month over an hour and half each time to get the run around.  Not likely to ever want these services again.  You were doing so well Vivnit….and now I can’t even recommend you to my neighbors.
NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER

I was lied to by the salesman in every thing he told me.  I told him from the first minute I did not need am update I did not use my system. I told him I was not going to pay for my system to be monitored. He told me I would not have to pay for the update.  There was no cost.  I did have to sign the tablet to authorize installation.  I guess that was when he  slipped the contract in. He assured me I would not be charged a monitoring fee.  Well they have drafted three payments out of my checking account.  I have called numerous times and been “passed around”.  The latest was I could buy out my contract.  I have never met a more dishonest company than Vivint.  They do not honor what their salesperson tells you.  I am a senior who is disabled with a terminal illness. I don’t need this.

I have been waiting for a month for Vivant to move my system and each time I call them they have a different excuse on why they can ‘t do it.  
They entered my address as a US address and then told me that they couldn’t provide service and wouldn’t cancel my contract and then they found out the problem on their end but I am still waiting for a install date.

Had my system installed 12/27/2011with the 36-month contract had minor problems with smoke/carbon monoxide detector changed battery didn’t help they came out and replaced it with a sensor that listens to my hard wired fire alarm system (building code required not Vivint) and no other problems with the system. My real complaint started after the 3-year contract ended the equipment became mine no more warranty. I have to pay for repairs.  I also  ask for a reduction in the monthly  fee from $49.99 to $34.99 with no contract over the phone they agreement was made (I thought) no email or letter to confirm (my bad) Just received new bill for $49.99 they claim i started new 3-contract with them 2-yr at $34.99 and 1-yr at 49.99 but I only have 10 payment left? all this time I thought I was off contract never recived any documentation stating otherwise  My battel with them is just starting . NOTE TO READERS BE VERY VERY CAREFUL OF VIVINT

I signed a contract with Vivant on June 2,2017. The sales guy told us that we have three days to cancel if we change our mind and to just let him know and he would come and take care of it for us. He also mentioned that since my husband is in the military that we can cancel at any time. Well my husband and I changed our mind and I texted the sales guy first thing the next morning June 3, 2017 and told him we decided to cancel and he kept putting us off for days. He assured us that he scheduled a tech to come out that next Thursday to take the alarm system out. I kept all of the text messages for proof. After about 5 days we could no longer reach the sales guy so I decided to call Vivant myself. When I called I was told that there was never a request to uninstall my system or to cancel. I then discovered that we were supposed to submit a cancellation notice paper that he left us before three days before they could cancel and that since it was way past the three days I could not cancel my contract. I was completely lied to by the sales jerk by telling me that he would take care of it for me. I did also discover that he did not tell me the whole truth about military being cancelled at any time. The rest of the truth is it is only if you are deployed. I threatened to sue their company after them refusing to cancel my policy and for lieing about everything. I asked to speak to a manager and explained that I had text messages between me and the sales guy of my request to cancel multiple times. Her name was Kierra R and she informed me that they would honor the text messages for proof of my request to cancel. I sent screenshots of all of the texts and emailed a request to cancel my policy as requested immediately. A appointment was scheduled to remove the alarm system later that month. I was assured my account would be cancelled so I didn’t think about it anymore. Vivant came and removed the alarm system and left a mess but I didn’t notice until later that they left their sign in our yard. On July 5th I was pissed when they took money out of my account the following month even though I was assured it was cancelled. I called Vivant again on July 5th and was told that the notes showed that they explained to me that they could not cancel my account. I was furious and demanded to talk to a manager but she said since it was a holiday they were not available. I called back July 5th and requested to speak to a manager and was told again that they will not cancel my policy. I called yet again a couple of days later and was told by a manager that he apologizes for the inconvenience and will manually cancel my policy and refund all of my money within the next 3-5 business days. Well after all of the lies I was really having a hard time believing this was cancelled. 5 days went by and there was not a refund or cancellation confirmation as informed there would be. I then called again and was told that that person does not exist and that they will not be able to cancel my policy. The text messages were not good enough. I was lied yet again. I am beyond frustrated and this company will not get away this. I have all of the proof I need to cancel my contract and refund all of my money. I filed a complaint with the attorney General in Arkansas and now am leaving one here as well. Hoping this will do something to hurt that horrible company.

There is no customer service. You call in speak with scripted personnel who can’t address significant issues. We had a fire in our basement, detector making noise when we arrived home yet no alarm. No response from any one even though we were told numerous times they would move our issue up the line. Their lack of follow through is insulting. The contract length feels like a legal scam. Look for much better options, wish we had.

Product is low quality. Have had the system only a few months. Front doorbell camera has failed twice. Had to be replaced once. 
Cameras are very low grade plastic and blow in the wind. They are highly variable when it comes to detection. 
We had a theft in our driveway today. 1:15 my vehicle was detected leaving and then at 3:15 detected returning. IN between the building materials are missing as evidenced by the camera clips. However the camera did not pick anyone up removing them? Although the camera settings according to Vivint should have. 
When asked what their policy was – it was simple we have no liability it is technology and it is bound to fail sometimes. 
Best of Luck with a company that behaves like this. Horrible. Just put up your kids toy cameras and buy the sign fro them (which took me asking three times to get one)

On the 14th of June 2017 I made a call to Vivint inquiring about a camera security system. The representative gathered information about reasoning for needing security cameras. After recommending their system I began gathering information about their products. He stated that I would likely need 3 cameras that he said were 1080p HD with night vision (the top of the line they offered)  and covered around 165 degrees each. One camera for the front, one camera for the back and one dedicated to our “problem” area. This area was a renter who had pointed a gun at me the previous day and when the police showed I had no witness’s or video.  So he informed me that it was going to be a 6yr contract and he needed to charge my debit card that night for around $53 to cover the installation No problem right, after all you want your life and family protected for longer than 6 years right.
    So on the morning of the 15th the tech shows up to install. I go over where I would like the cameras installed with the tech and asked for his recommendation as well, since he does do this for a living. At this time he informs me there is going to be significant gaps in video coverage. I’m confused so I ask to explain to me these gaps, he tells me that since the cameras only cover about 45 to 50 degrees each I’m going to have a lot of dead space. Woah…. strike # 1!!! I ask him to get his manager on the phone now. Oh BTW we have been with ADT for 13 years before the 15th of June and cancelled on the 15th (Vivint offered financing and ADT didn’t) So we are in a bit of a pickle, no security active at this point, the tech’s manager authorized an additional “doorbell camera” to be added to cover some of the dead space. Doorbell camera covers about 160 degrees with a fishbowl appearance through the camera.
      Five hours later the three outdoor cameras and the doorbell camera are installed and activated. Couldn’t get worse right? While I’m e-signing the contract I read the satisfaction policy, it states that I have 3 days to evaluate the system and if for any reason I’m not happy call for a refund and the contract will be null and void. Heck no! I said you better get your manager on the phone and give me a 30 day return policy or you can start taking your equipment down from my house. Manager says “I’ll go ahead an annotate it here in the record that I authorized a 30 day return policy.” NOT HAPPENING I said you send me an email right now or I’m not signing a thing more. Well 5 minutes later I have an email extending my return (It’s called and ROR) for 30 days. Use that term and people will listen when they are installing or trying to sell you something.
     Note to the buyer, you better have the best (fastest) WiFi available or you will be me as well. I have COX which has the fastest speed available 300meg down 30meg up. This system NEEDS UPLOAD SPEED! Every camera requires a MINIMUM of 1.5meg UPLOAD speed. All cameras are wireless,  hardwired for power and WiFi for data transmission. The very first night we had issues with the cameras dropping off line without us knowing about it. We had to call the next day and set an appointment for them to come back out to try and fix the brand new system out of the box! 4 days later the same tech comes out and puts in a single signal booster in attempt to attain the required signal strength (80% BTW) this is found on your 7in LCD control panel.
    The tech was unable to get the necessary signal strength after multiple attempts that afternoon. BTW we have a 4 bedroom 2 bath single story regular pitch house, nothing crazy. So the tech said he doesn’t  know what to do he has done everything he can. So we had to call back to set another appointment up, two days later on the next appointment time 8-11AM the tech doesn’t show doesn’t call nothing. I have to call them. Now they tell me it’s going to be another 4 days before they can get the next tech out! During this time we evaluate our coverage’s and conclude we will need another 2 cameras to cover the dead spots (someone was able to get under one of our cameras and have a cigarette and blow smoke to the camera during night vision). The next tech shows up assess the situation installs 2 more cameras and another booster and the system appears to be working with all cameras above the required 80%. Yeah…right?
     We had multiple cameras go offline over the week end without us knowing. The system comes with video clips that it stores when the cameras detects motion within the areas you set up. Well we would have no footage for hours at a time during the night and day. So we had to set up another appointment and guess what happened they no called no showed us again. I was talking to them on one line and my wife was calling them to cancel on the other line!! We agreed to have one more person come out and try to fix it. He arrived and attempted to fix it by changing out the control panel as well as remove their wireless router that was running thru our wireless router (made no sense) and was successful in attaining 3.8meg upload speed from the control panel. At this point we initiated the cancellation with the service tech while he was on speaker phone with the RoR department manager (Make sure you do this) so the manager can send an email to me validating the cancellation was received and the appointment was made by them to come get the equipment and no further action was required by myself other to be at my house for them to come pick up the equipment. When the date came for the appointment to pick up their equipment they didn’t show, I called them at 11:05 and told them they didn’t show and the equipment was mine I had a phone call 15 later by a tech that said “I was in the neighborhood and wasn’t supposed to be there till tomorrow but I can be there in 15 minutes”.
     Conclusion – System’s concept is awesome!! Cameras when they worked were very good, night vision was ok but still rate them good. Function was good except the system can’t be viewed on “playback” (your reviewing continues footage from the previous time period of your choice) from anything but your mobile device. Doorbell camera was great in quality and function (only one that never lost connection). To this day I’m still waiting for our refund, the absolute worst customer service by virtue of the division of labor. No one department can help you with the other. When you are transferred in starts you in the Q for another department. My average was 1hr 17mins every time I called, with my longest being 2:14 while trouble shooting the system. If you have no problem dealing with this for 6 yrs or you can drop over $1700 upfront and incur a 3 yr contract and own cameras that drop off line every day multiple times go for it. I do wish I had this review before I even tried the system out.

DO NOT deal with this company.  In May 2012, I moved my parents from FL to MA under  stressful conditions, including last rights given to my step-father, long hospitalization and rehabilitation.  Got them back to MA and had to reconstruct their life, including all of their paperwork.  I was unable to find the contract from VIVINT and was unaware it even existed.  For five years this company has been taking $48.14 out of my mother’s account with no communication with the contract holder.  Since this has been discovered, I called the company and the individual who answered phone only identified himself as “account manager of the day” and refused to provide his name.  He was so rude I told him the company would be hearing from my attorney and terminated the call.  My attorney got involved and sent VIVINT a letter of representation which has been ignored.  His call to the company was answered by a female who also did not identify her name or answer my attorney’s question about the location of the home office of VIVINT.  This company is TERRIBLE, including their customer service.

Don’t like the system , tried it out for 19 days thinking our try out period it was 30 days or 60, have called few times and last service rep. says our try out period was 3 days :(  which is a joke, how could you try something in three days , also the system kind of work for 4 or 5 days. Then our cell apps were not working right, the battery of the from door run out of power the first week …so C.S, they said they were going to give us a 5 dollar credit for the batteries.  NOT HAPPY.  They are going around the bushes to cancel service…., please anyone help….!!!!!!

I had mine installed yesterday and accidentally set off alarm. They were so incredibly helpful and patient then assisted me with calling support. The person on the support line took as long as I needed and walked me through each and every screen and would not hang up until I was sure I understood everything. If first impressions area ny indication, I’ll be very happy with Vivint.

What a piece of crap company, had system installed, then I had to move camera power plug to permanent location. Plugged camera back in, it wouldn’t come back on line, so i called customer service the first time, and was told that they couldn’t do anything, and would send out a tech 8 days from the phone call!!! Funny I had to pay during this time. Called a second time, was on the phone for over 100 mins., still couldn’t fix camera, but was told tech would be out 2 days later, guess what, no tech ever showed or called. During that time system completely crashed, door bell went off, finally had to unplug everything and no monotoring system personel ever called to see what happened.  So we have no tech support that came, hi-tech equipment that doesn’t work, no security system but we have their monthly bill.

Vivint has the worst consumer services of any business I have ever dealt with. I purchased a home with the service in it and I have to pay the cancellation fees to no longer have the service. Vivint a cancellation fee is the full rate per month times the months still on contract. Opt to transfer to my name as might as well get something in return they fail to show up for scheduled appointments to transfer and expect me to take more time off work and away from important daily scheduled events. Customer service does nothing to rectify and spends over 90 minutes in the phone with no solution.
