FLOYD, Va. and INDEPENDENCE, Va., Aug. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- On August 8, 2016, Parkway Acquisition Corp. (Parkway) announced second quarter earnings for both Grayson Bankshares, Inc. (Grayson), and Cardinal Bankshares Corporation (Cardinal), and provided an update on the recently completed merger of Grayson and Cardinal.








As previously announced, Grayson and Cardinal merged with and into Parkway on July 1, 2016, with Parkway as the surviving corporation.  Immediately following that merger, Cardinal's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Bank of Floyd, merged with and into Grayson's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Grayson National Bank, with Grayson National Bank as the surviving bank.  All earnings information contained herein is reported at and for the periods ended June 30, 2016, and, as such, relates solely to Grayson or Cardinal, respectively, prior to the closing of the merger.
Grayson reported consolidated net income of $541 thousand for the second quarter of 2016 versus consolidated net income of $370 thousand for the same quarter in 2015.  Net interest margin increased to 3.85% from 3.46% for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to decreases in interest rates on deposits combined with a $10.0 million reduction in long-term fixed rate borrowings.  Non-interest income decreased to $648 thousand from $680 thousand while non-interest expense decreased to $2.65 million from $2.71 million, for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Grayson recognized $68 thousand in merger related expenses during the second quarter of 2016.   Loan balances increased to $244.8 million at June 30, 2016 from $241.2 million at December 31, 2015.  Deposits decreased to $274.3 million from $279.9 million, and total assets decreased to $317.5 million from $331.8 million over the same time period.  The decrease in total assets was due primarily to the reduction in borrowings.  
Cardinal reported a consolidated net loss of $354 thousand for the second quarter versus consolidated net income of $102 thousand for the same quarter in 2015. The loss was due primarily to the recognition during the quarter of $376 thousand in expenses related to the merger. Net interest margin increased to 3.38% from 3.21% for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Non-interest income increased to $294 thousand from $266 thousand, and non-interest expense decreased to $2.71 million from $2.79 million, for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Loan balances decreased to $164.0 million at June 30, 2016 from $167.7 million at December 31, 2015 and deposit balances decreased to $218.9 million from $222.0 million over the same time period.  Total assets decreased by $10.8 million to $249.4 million at June 30, 2016, compared to $260.2 million at December 31, 2015.  The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in borrowings of $8.0 million.    
Regarding the recently completed merger, President and CEO Allan Funk stated, "The merger of Grayson and Cardinal with and into Parkway, and the combination of Grayson National Bank and Bank of Floyd into a single national bank charter, was completed on July 1st.  As you will recall from our special meetings and investor sessions, we have a project underway to rebrand the combined bank early next year in conjunction with the integration of our bank's major computer systems and operational processes. During this integration process, we are mindful of our dual objectives to reduce the combined bank's total costs by eliminating redundant systems and processes while offering improvements in products, services and technology for our customers." 
SEVP and CFO Blake Edwards added, "Shareholders should have received by now a letter from our transfer agent, Computershare, with information about your stock certificate exchange process.  If you need assistance with the process, please feel free to ask one of our branches for help, and they will put you in contact with one of several individuals internally who can assist you with this process.  Likewise, look for an announcement soon on our new ticker symbol as our shares in Parkway Acquisition Corp., the new holding company, begin to trade publicly."

FLOYD, Va. and INDEPENDENCE, Va., Feb. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- On February 15, 2017, Parkway Acquisition Corp. (Parkway) announced fourth quarter 2016 earnings and provided an update on the July 1, 2016 merger with Grayson Bankshares, Inc. (Grayson), and Cardinal Bankshares Corporation (Cardinal).








As previously announced, Grayson and Cardinal merged with and into Parkway on July 1, 2016, with Parkway as the surviving corporation.  Immediately following that merger, Cardinal's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Bank of Floyd, merged with and into Grayson's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Grayson National Bank. Bank of Floyd continues to operate as a separate division of Grayson National Bank until our systems conversion and rebranding are complete, expected to be on March 13, 2017. (For accounting purposes, Grayson is considered the acquiror and Cardinal is considered the acquiree in the transaction. As such, all information contained herein as of and for periods prior to July 1, 2016 reflects the operations of Grayson prior to the merger.)  
Parkway recorded pre-tax earnings of $556 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to a pre-tax loss of $175 thousand for the same period in 2015.  Income tax expense increased by $87 thousand from the fourth quarter of 2015 to 2016 resulting net income of $397 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to a net loss of $247 thousand for the same period in 2015. The increase in pretax earnings of $731 thousand from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2016 was due primarily to the merger with Cardinal. Earnings for the year totaled $2.4 million, compared to $1.0 million in 2015. 
Total interest income increased by $2.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2015, while interest expense on deposits increased by $142 thousand over the same period.  The increase in interest income was attributable primarily to the merger with Cardinal which added approximately $157.9 million in loans and $16.0 million in investment securities to the Company's earning assets.  While interest on loans increased based upon the increased balances, the prolonged low interest rate environment combined with increasing competition continues to place downward pressure on overall loan yields.  Interest expense on deposits increased by $142 thousand due to the addition of interest-bearing deposits from the Cardinal merger.  The average interest rate paid for deposits continues to decrease as longer term time deposits continue to reprice at current lower rates.  Interest expense on borrowings decreased by $124 thousand due to a reduction in borrowings of $10.0 million early in 2016.  
The provision for loan losses was a negative $52 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, compared to a negative $68 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.  The reserve for loan losses at December 31, 2016 was approximately 0.83% of total loans, compared to 1.44% at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in the reserve percentage was due to the Cardinal acquisition and the application of purchase accounting guidance which required the elimination of Cardinal's loan loss reserves.  Management's estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the acquired Cardinal loan portfolio was reflected as a purchase discount which will be accreted into income over the remaining life of the acquired loans.  Management believes the provision and the resulting allowance for loan losses are adequate.
Total noninterest income was $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to $577 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The increase was due primarily to the Cardinal merger. Service charges on deposit accounts as well as other account-based service charges and fees increased due to the increased number of accounts and deposit balances. The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Cardinal acquisition, when compared with the value of consideration paid, resulted in a bargain purchase gain of $891 thousand, of which $709 thousand was recognized in the fourth quarter based upon an adjustment to the value of deferred tax assets acquired in the merger.
Total noninterest expense increased by $2.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2015 due to the Cardinal acquisition.  Salaries and employee benefit expenses increased by $1.2 million as the number of employees increased from approximately 110 prior to the combination, to 185 after the combination.    Merger related expenses totaled $763 thousand for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 compared to $434 thousand for the quarter ended December, 2015.
President and CEO Allan Funk stated, "Earnings for 2016 exceeded our expectations due to the impact of nonrecurring purchase accounting adjustments; however, we are pleased with the fact that our core earnings were very much in line with our projections.  Earnings will continue to be impacted in early 2017 as we complete our systems conversion and fully integrate our banks; however, we believe that the majority of our merger related costs are now behind us and we anticipate improved earnings as we take advantage of the opportunities that our combined organization is expected to have going forward."

(Grayson), and Cardinal Bankshares Corporation (Cardinal), and provided an update on the recently completed merger of Grayson and Cardinal.As previously announced, Grayson and Cardinal merged with and into Parkway on July 1, 2016, with Parkway as the surviving corporation.  Immediately following that merger, Cardinal's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Bank of Floyd, merged with and into Grayson's wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Grayson National Bank, with Grayson National Bank as the surviving bank.  All earnings information contained herein is reported at and for the periods ended June 30, 2016, and, as such, relates solely to Grayson or Cardinal, respectively, prior to the closing of the merger.Grayson reported consolidated net income of $541 thousand for the second quarter of 2016 versus consolidated net income of $370 thousand for the same quarter in 2015.  Net interest margin increased to 3.85% from 3.46% for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to decreases in interest rates on deposits combined with a $10.0 million reduction in long-term fixed rate borrowings.  Non-interest income decreased to $648 thousand from $680 thousand while non-interest expense decreased to $2.65 million from $2.71 million, for the second quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Grayson recognized $68 thousand in merger related expenses during the second quarter of 2016.   Loan balances increased to $244.8 million at June 30, 2016 from $241.2 million at December 31, 2015.  Deposits decreased to $274.3 million from $279.9 million, and total assets decreased to $317.5 million from $331.8 million over the same time period.  The decrease in total assets was due primarily to the reduction in borrowings. Cardinal reported a consolidated net loss of $354 thousand for the second quarter versus consolidated net income of $102 thousand for the same quarter in 2015. The loss was due primarily to the recognition during the quarter of $376 thousand in expenses related to the merger.

During this integration process, we are mindful of our dual objectives to reduce the combined bank's total costs by eliminating redundant systems and processes while offering improvements in products, services and technology for our customers."SEVP and CFO Blake Edwards added, "Shareholders should have received by now a letter from our transfer agent, Computershare, with information about your stock certificate exchange process.  If you need assistance with the process, please feel free to ask one of our branches for help, and they will put you in contact with one of several individuals internally who can assist you with this process.  Likewise, look for an announcement soon on our new ticker symbol as our shares in Parkway Acquisition Corp., the new holding company, begin to trade publicly."Read MoreForward-looking statementsThis release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934 as amended. These include statements as to the benefits of the merger, as well as other statements of expectations regarding the merger and any other statements regarding future results or expectations. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are including this statement for purposes of these safe harbor provisions. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies, and expectations of the combined company, are generally identified by the use of words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," or "project" or similar expressions. Our ability to predict results, or the actual effect of future plans or strategies, is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations and future prospects of the combined company and its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to: the risk that the businesses of Cardinal and/or Grayson will not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; expected revenue synergies and cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; revenues following the merger may be lower than expected; customer and employee relationships and business operations may be disrupted by the merger; changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government, including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board; the quality and composition of the loan and securities portfolios; demand for loan products; deposit flows; competition; demand for financial services in the combined company's market area; the implementation of new technologies; the ability to develop and maintain secure and reliable electronic systems; and accounting principles, policies, and guidelines. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements.  We undertake no obligation to update or clarify these forward‐looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
