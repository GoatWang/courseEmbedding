CEO Message



Since the company was founded in August 2003, we have adhered to a philosophy of maintaining our corporate pride and values while developing and applying our own technology in the legal field. All our employees are versed in the methodologies and practices of advancing global business and as they proceeded step by step we were able to grow the business into a company with a recognized presence in the fields of investigation of illegal activity and international litigation support. In particular in the United States, which is a major litigation market, we acted early to set up a subsidiary to create the business organization for that market. We then went public and through corporate buyouts and continued changes and evolution were able to gain a position putting us on a stable growth path for the business and the company.
These endeavors gave rise to KIBIT, our artificial intelligence. KIBIT has an unsurpassed ability to understand an individual’s experience, knowledge, and feeling and to analyze the data. This has business potential across various fields and the company has produced results, which have drawn the attention of both society and industry. In 2015 KIBIT was used to commercialize new growth areas such as health care, business intelligence and marketing and to create new revenue streams.
These were not the only management changes. For the company to commence a true “creation of the future for individuals and society” we have progressed from our corporate brand to a new philosophy brand, FRONTEO, which signifies progress and a reason for corporate existence. The company has determined to continue its future corporate activities in line with this new corporate philosophy and guideline for behavior.
KIBIT, which was developed from within UBIC’s legal business, is significantly expanding its capabilities and potential across business fields under the new FRONTEO brand. Together with the symbol symbolizing valuable future creation we face a new stage as we look forward to the existence of the company and the business shining a bright light on the world. Facing this new opportunity we hope we can count on your cooperation as we aim for growth of the FRONTEO brand and further development of the business.

The new corporate brand represents a philosophy symbolizing the mission.

It also reflects an abbreviation of “Frontier Technology Organization” that signifies “progressive, leading-edge value creators”.

The FRONTEO mark features multi-radiated axes, which represent the potential expansion of the business around the AI platform.
The FRONTEO symbol also has the power to unify and symbolizes diversity and immense strength and inspiration.
Visually the FRONTEO symbol embodies the word “bright” (appealing to both meaning and emotion).
The distinct color and form creates an optical illusion with shades of blue and yellow on the inside.

Audit｜Solutions｜FRONTEO Global Website


















Audit


AI Ensures Efficient, High-Precision, Around-the-Clock Auditing 
The KIBIT AI has learned the investigative techniques used by auditors and uses these to extract relevant e-mails, as well as automatically learning from audit results. It provides a visual representation of inherent risk incredibly cheaply, accurately, and speedily.






HOMESolutionsAudit





OverviewAs a measure to address the legal risk of companies concerning electronic communication through e-mail, etc., we have utilized our past knowledge and investigational experience, along with the latest technology developed in-house, to establish an unparalleled “AI-based audit method.”




E-mail has become the most common means of transmitting information in recent years, so the importance of e-mail auditing for companies is growing rapidly. However, it is difficult to examine and audit the immense volume of day-to-day e-mail traffic manually, so existing e-mail auditing processes have been a barrier to countering legal risks, such as international litigation, the leakage of confidential information, and unauthorized trading.
KIBIT has learned the investigative techniques used by auditors and uses these to extract relevant e-mails, as well as automatically learning from audit results. It identifies and analyzes risk incredibly cheaply, accurately, and speedily, in a way that was thought to be impossible with conventional technologies.








Data leakage
KIBIT promptly identifies signs that confidential information is being leaked as a result of internal malpractice, and prevents technologies and confidential sales information being taken to domestic or overseas competitors by employees, an issue of life-or-death importance to Japanese companies. Analysis of past cases has shown us that there are three phases in deliberate data leakage: “cultivation,” “preparation,” and “execution.” The perpetrator’s motivation to leak data is fostered during the “cultivation” phase. By using e-mail audits to identify e-mails expressing grievances/dissatisfaction with the company or referring to money worries, which are indicative of this phase, companies can prevent internal malpractice before it reaches the “execution” phase, during which prevention is much more difficult.


Combating cartels and activities that violate antimonopoly laws
In recent years, a number of companies have fallen afoul of U.S. antitrust law (laws prohibiting and restricting the restraint of trade), which is analogous to Japan’s Antimonopoly Act, resulting in large fines and, in the worst cases, the imprisonment of employees. KIBIT has learned the investigative techniques used by auditors, so it can identify differences in nuance that were hard to detect via e-mail filtering based on ordinary keyword searches. By identifying e-mails that refer to playing golf or going drinking with employees of rival companies, which are indicative of the “building a relationship” and “preparation” phases, companies can prevent the formation of cartels.




Combating accounting fraud, bribery, and activities that violate the FCPA
As corporate transactions become increasingly borderless, countries across the globe are stepping up their efforts to unearth dishonest practices involving the bribery of public officials abroad. The U.S. FCPA and the UK’s Bribery Act have been tightened up, as have anti-bribery regulations in China, Japan, and Russia, among others, with a consequent increase in both the number of prosecutions and the total value of fines. Our AI-based solution to combat accounting fraud, bribery, and activities that violate the FCPA detects the counterparts in staff transactions and the bribery of public officials abroad. This prevents corruption, which can lead to the imprisonment of staff if unearthed by the authorities.


Voice analysis designed for the finance industry
The finance industry seeks to strengthen frameworks for managing corporate information and prevent insider trading and data leakage via information management of not only electronic data, but also many other storage media. The task of dealing with voice data is still thought to be something that can only be carried out by a human listening to the actual recording. This places a tremendous burden on companies in terms of cost, time, and effort. FRONTEO has developed an automatic speech-to-text engine specifically designed for the finance industry and offers specialist voice analysis services that incorporate advanced analytical technologies.

eDiscovery

						FRONTEO’s eDiscovery provides end-to-end expertise to assist law firms and corporate legal departments. At every step in the eDiscovery lifecycle, FRONTEO delivers the technology and know-how you need to succeed.					














Preservation & Legal Hold
Preservation and legal hold done properly at the beginning of a case prevents costly production issues and potential sanctions later on. Managing preservation and legal holds by spreadsheet is not reliable or scalable. Fortunately, in today’s environment technology can enable better results.

									Learn more								







Forensic Collection
Forensic collection is the physical acquisition of digital data using methodologies that satisfy evidentiary requirements relating to chain-of-custody and authentication. It requires expertise and a defensible process, and when done right, sets the tone for overall project efficiency.

									Learn more								







Processing
Properly processing ESI may result in the reduction of electronic document collections by as much as 80%. The benefit: a significant reduction in the amount of professional time required to review data collections.

									Learn more								







Managed Review & Staffing
Managed Review is much more than a room filled with contract reviewers plowing through documents while trying to meet volume standards. It requires a commitment to building and retaining a global full-time staff with the education and experience to deliver the best possible outcome for every project, every time.

									Learn more								







Secure Hosting
As eDiscovery continues to evolve, one thing is certain, the amount of data you need to house is ever increasing. A hosting partner that meets your needs today, and has the capacity to handle your needs tomorrow, is critical to the continuity of your eDiscovery projects.

									Learn more								







Production
Document production is where all the hours of time and effort you have invested in document review come to fruition. In most cases there are last minute changes, high pressure deadlines, and serious consequences you will want to avoid for failing to meet production obligations.

									Learn more								







Managed Services
FRONTEO’s Managed Services Partnership (MSP) delivers cost predictability and assures compliance with budget commitments while leveraging the expertise of both your in-house capabilities and our professional staff.

									LEARN MORE								







End-to-End eDiscovery
We guide our clients through all phases of the electronic discovery (eDiscovery) process by utilizing best-of-breed technology. With an experienced project management team consisting of attorneys, technology specialists, and practice support from AMLaw100 firms, FRONTEO partners with our clients from beginning to end to ensure cost containment and legal defensibility.

FRONTEO Announces That More Than 50 Companies Have Adopted Products Equipped with Its AI Engine KIBIT

					TOKYO, July 06, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — FRONTEO, Inc. (“FRONTEO”) (NASDAQ:FTEO) (TSE:2158), a leading provider of artificial intelligence (“AI”) based big data analysis services, announced at its Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on June 29th that more than 50 companies have introduced products equipped with KIBIT, the AI engine developed by FRONTEO.

FRONTEO’s AI business includes the “KIBIT Knowledge Probe” system for the supporting analysis of business data, the “KIBIT Patent Explorer” system for patent research and analysis, the “KIBIT Email Auditor” system, the “AI Process Outsourcing” system that promotes processes that use AI, the “AI Utilization Expert Development Program”, and the “Financial Institution Solutions” system.

FRONTEO’s AI business had 45 companies as clients and achieved 280 million yen in sales in FY2016 (ended March 31, 2017), which is more than double FY2015 (ended March 31, 2016) with 20 companies as clients and 110 million yen in sales. Adoption of FRONTEO’s services has continued to grow in the current fiscal year, and the cumulative number of companies implementing the services is now more than 50 as of June 29, 2017. These solid achievements are results of increased awareness in the improvement of operational efficiency and the creation of added value through the use of companies’ text data assets, the increased understanding of the implementation of artificial intelligence, positive customer feedback regarding trial results that had been conducted up until the previous year, and the Company’s ability to provide a full range of related services for software products equipped with KIBIT.
KIBIT Knowledge Probe is widely used in the analysis of various text data handled by companies. In particular, it is attracting attention for its improvement of customer satisfaction, compliance efforts, and application in Regtech (Regulation × Technology) for financial institutions. Further developments such as the implementation to support the judgment of fund managers during investments are expected. KIBIT Knowledge Probe has also started to be used in HRtech (Human Resource × Technology) to improve retention rates by finding signs that point to employee turnover.
Utilization of KIBIT Patent Explorer by manufacturers is increasing, especially in the chemicals sector. In addition to the utilization by professionals in human resource development programs, Patent Explorer is also penetrating into the intellectual property sector, such as the establishment of a platform for KIBIT Patent Explorer users to exchange collected information. In addition, KIBIT Email Auditor has been adopted by foreign companies.
Products equipped with KIBIT offer affordable implementation and running costs, and are highly regarded among AI-related products as a result of their user friendly features, application with a small amount of data, and their practical effectiveness such as providing analysis results in a short amount of time. FRONTEO will further strengthen the adoption of KIBIT-related AI products while continuing to provide a sound development and sales framework.

FRONTEO Announces That More Than 50 Companies Have Adopted Products Equipped With Its AI Engine KIBIT






GlobeNewswire



Jul 6, 2017 9:00 AM EDT













 




























































 TOKYO, July 06, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FRONTEO, Inc. ("FRONTEO") (NASDAQ:FTEO) (TSE:2158), a leading provider of artificial intelligence ("AI") based big data analysis services, announced at its Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on June 29th that more than 50 companies have introduced products equipped with KIBIT, the AI engine developed by FRONTEO. FRONTEO's AI business includes the "KIBIT Knowledge Probe" system for the supporting analysis of business data, the "KIBIT Patent Explorer" system for patent research and analysis, the "KIBIT Email Auditor" system, the "AI Process Outsourcing" system that promotes processes that use AI, the "AI Utilization Expert Development Program", and the "Financial Institution Solutions" system. FRONTEO's AI business had 45 companies as clients and achieved 280 million yen in sales in FY2016 (ended March 31, 2017), which is more than double FY2015 (ended March 31, 2016) with 20 companies as clients and 110 million yen in sales. Adoption of FRONTEO's services has continued to grow in the current fiscal year, and the cumulative number of companies implementing the services is now more than 50 as of June 29, 2017. These solid achievements are results of increased awareness in the improvement of operational efficiency and the creation of added value through the use of companies' text data assets, the increased understanding of the implementation of artificial intelligence, positive customer feedback regarding trial results that had been conducted up until the previous year, and the Company's ability to provide a full range of related services for software products equipped with KIBIT. KIBIT Knowledge Probe is widely used in the analysis of various text data handled by companies. In particular, it is attracting attention for its improvement of customer satisfaction, compliance efforts, and application in Regtech (Regulation × Technology) for financial institutions. Further developments such as the implementation to support the judgment of fund managers during investments are expected. KIBIT Knowledge Probe has also started to be used in HRtech (Human Resource × Technology) to improve retention rates by finding signs that point to employee turnover.
