Fully closed system that verifies gastric acidity. Protects from exposure to aspirate. Indicated for pediatrics and adults.

Nursing and Patient Safety Organizations are calling for the immediate discontinuation of auscultation to confirm tube gastric placement and use of pH as one of the indicators. (American Association of Critical Care Nurses (AACN 2005), the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA 2011) and Children’s Hospital Association (CHA 2012).
RightBio Metrics pH indicators are a cost effective way to confirm gastric acidity of tubes intended for the stomach. Published studies show pH can be used in place of x-ray to confirm initial placement. In some hospitals x-ray is only used when pH is inconclusive. (Resource Set… NHS Improvement 2016, p.9)
Additionally the pH indicators can be used:

when there is a suspected mis-placements
when there is a shift change
prior to each feed/medication delivery.

Published studies cite that 21-56% of tubes intended for the stomach are confirmed elsewhere in the body. (Following the Evidence/CHOP study 2015, p. 1 of article) 
ENA (emergency nursing association) Clinical Practice Guidelines 2015 does not recommend auscultation. They site x-ray and pH as the best methods to confirm tube placement. Using pH reduces your patients:

exposure to x-ray
time in the emergency department
cost (x-ray vs. RightLevel).

RightBioMetrics has the only FDA Cleared/CLIA waived product for using pH to assess tube placement ending in the stomach. Though pH paper is used by some facilities, it requires daily calibration, exposes healthcare workers to gastric aspirate and readings can be affected by color of aspirate. What makes the RightBioMetrics pH indicators unique is that they are a fully enclosed, accurate point of care test that makes assessing pH easy and safe. The CPT code 83986 can be used for reimbursement.

About
HomeAbout 









Founded by physicians in gastroenterology and emergency medicine, RighBio Metrics addresses a very serious problem in healthcare: How do we accurately measure bio fluids to enhance the speed and quality of medical treatment – without incurring substantial costs?
RightBio Metrics was founded by Paul Gilbert MD, Board Certified in Emergency Medicine, and his father, Robert Gilbert MD, Board Certified in Gastroenterology in 2005. Dr. Paul Gilbert’s first-hand experience with tube misplacement and the frustration experienced in emergency medicine with uncertainty about treatment-critical metrics lead to a passion for developing more appropriate technologies. The innovations by the Dr. Gilberts, while leveraging widely acclaimed measurement practices, represent a revolution in the technologies that deliver such metrics – to enable better patient care and prevent severe accidents.

RightpH: pH Measurement Technology

RightpH solutions are pH measurement technology from RightBio Metrics that  answers key treatment needs:
"How do we ensure accurate tube placement for eating and suction tubes without losing critical time and spending resources on X-rays?"
"How do we determine the stomach pH level of critically ill patients to accurately provide the best possible treatment?"
In emergency medicine, quick decisions have to be made in treatment environments that often do not permit the use of expensive equipment. While pH measurement has become standard of practice to ensure better treatment, RightpH offers the first safe and efficient technologies for pH measurement.
RightpH is new pH technology that enables clinicians to introduce science into critical decision-making about tube placement and treatment of critically ill patients – based on clean, safe, and accurate metrics. Clinicians can safely reduce uncertainty and enhance outcome – without losing critical time.

Gastric acidity verification for NG suction, feeding and PEG tubes to assist in proper placement

RightSpot is a small, non-invasive device that is placed on the end of the tube. When fluid is aspirated into the device, an accurate pH measurement can be made to determine gastric acidity and proper tube placement. RightSpot will give an accurate pH reading that can:

Avoid messy and unsafe pH paper measurement
Reduce cost of X-rays to determine placement
Determine placement instantly, regardless of treatment environment
Avoid critical events to enhance clinician certainty

Determine pH level of critically ill patients’ stomach to bring science into clinical decision-making

Similar to RightSpot, RightLevel is a small, non-invasive device that is placed on the end of the tube. When gastric fluid is aspirated into the device, pH level can be accurately determined.

Create certainty about pH level to enable more precise treatment
Enable correct dosage to speed up patient care results
Enhance patient care quality through scientific diagnostics
Reduce cost of readmission and malpractice suits

Gastric acidity verification with NG feeding tubes

Leveraging the more advanced technology of the RightLevel indicator, RightSpot Infant enables precise location verification in infants. The device is similar to RightSpot, but is smaller, provides even more precise pH level indication and is effective in obtaining accurate gastric pH readings on patients with reduced gastric fluid. These pH readings can:

Decrease X-rays on infants
Enable precise placement verification in infants
Increase certainty of placement at every feeding

Gastric acidity verification for NG suction, feeding and PEG tubes to assist in proper placement

Faulty feeding and suction tube placement is the source of  severe patient injury or death in a large number of patients

12.6 million tubes placed in the US alone in 2012
0.5-2% are misplaced*
Consequences are severe, often leading to death
Existing technologies are: expensive, inaccurate, limited to acute treatment environments

RightSpot indicators are inexpensive and allow clinicians to improve treatment while saving hospitals critical resources. Using pH for verification of placement can:

Decrease clinican exposure to bodily fluids
Avoid messy, unsafe, and inaccurate pH paper measurement
Reduce number of X-rays to determine placement
Reduce patient exposure to radiation 
Determine placement instantly, regardless of treatment environment
Decrease patient turn-around time in the ER
Avoid critical events and enhance clinician certainty

RightSpot is a small, non-invasive in vitro diagnostic device that is used to verify gastric acidity to avoid misplacement of nasogastric feeding/suctions tubes and PEG tubes. The RightSpot indicator is placed on the tube and gastric fluid is aspirated; a pH below 4.5 would indicate gastric acidity. This method is simple, inexpensive and results are instant: Right measurement, right away.
Currently, many hospitals use only auscultation to determine if these tubes are in the correct place. This method has proven to be inadequate. In a published study in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology, “Auscultation alone was ineffective as a confirmatory test with only 6.3% specificity.”
Using X-ray for tube placement verification is very expensive and time consuming and is limited in terms of where it can be used. While pH measurement has become standard of practice to ensure appropriate placement, RightpH offers the first safe and efficient technologies for pH measurement.
Misplaced tubes cause significant morbidity and mortality and cost medical providers millions of dollars. From 2001 to 2011, in one metropolitan area (Chicago) alone, medical providers have paid over 10 million dollars to resolve lawsuits filed for injuries and deaths caused by misplaced NG feeding and suction tubes.
RightSpot pH indicator from RightpH help clinicians put science into decision-making and increase certainty about tube placement and treatment decisions. At the same time, RightpH indicators help hospitals save important resources by reducing malpractice claims, improve treatment and position themselves as leaders in patient safety and clinician practice conditions.
