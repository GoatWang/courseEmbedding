How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Anderson, Gary E carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Anderson, Gary E



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Anderson, Gary E



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Anderson, Gary E.





BS Chemical Engineering 1967





Gary Anderson, a leader in industry, has stood on the shoulders of giants—that is, his parents, whom he speaks of with fondness and admiration.
 Anderson grew up in Ishpeming on Michigan’s iron range. His grandfather was killed in a mining accident, so his father had to quit school at age 15 and go to work in the mines to support the family. When his parents started their own family, they worked their hearts out for their children. His mother wanted to make sure he had a good education; his father wanted him to have a better life than he had. “They never had anything beyond the basics,” Anderson recalls, and he’s amazed yet at their sacrifice, so he could go to college.
 Anderson went on to earn a BS in chemical engineering in 1967. Tech proved to be tough, but he welcomed the rigor. “It hardened you and sharpened you to compete globally.”
 He spent his entire career at Dow Corning, becoming president, CEO, and chairman. He retired in 2004 after seeing the firm grow thirtyfold and be recognized as one of the nation’s top 100 companies to work for.
 He says life is like a pyramid. The foundation is education; the building blocks are the opportunities and challenges of life. “All your life is about learning,” he avows. He allows that his pyramid is “big and broad,” for he was always interested in other people, projects, and countries.
 Global competition is the biggest challenge facing America, he says. “Our country has not accepted the fact that we are no longer the most economically efficient and powerful. We’ve seen the glory days. Now we have to sacrifice to stay competitive.”
 Anderson was a 1991–2003 member and a past president of the Board of Trustees of the Tech Fund. He was instrumental in securing major funding for the Dow Environmental Sciences Building. He and his wife, Judy, are members of the 1885 Society, supporting an endowed research fund in chemical engineering.
 “I would not have achieved what I did without Tech. It made me strong and resilient. Tech is important to me because, if our country is to stay competitive, we need bright creative young scientists and engineers to make it happen.”
