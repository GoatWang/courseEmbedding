Very cute 3 bedroom home! Just minutes from South Town Shopping Center and YMCA. This would be a great first home. Kitchen features a large seating area with plenty of space to entertain. Basement could be used as another living area and possibly a 4th bedroom or den. The outside of the home has a nice concrete drive way with additional parking as well as a two car garage.

Billingson February 26, 2016Verified PurchaseThese are great extension cords. I'm a mobile DJ and many time we have gigs where there are only a couple of power outlets and I'm running a couple hundred feet of cable to reach everything. With these cables I've had no issue with power dropping or them falling apart. They seem to be very high quality and don't seem to easily break. I would recommend these for any application you have that need a lot of daisy chains or is in a high traffic area.Read more0Comment|

Thatcheron January 24, 2017Verified PurchaseUsed for less than a week, and the plug simply stopped supplying power. Our outlets are in good shape, and tried this plug on a variety of locations - no power. Great price and would have been a terrific purchase, had it worked properly. Even considering the low price it was a complete waste of money. Disappointed in this unreliable item.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse4.0 out of 5 starsVery nice!!
