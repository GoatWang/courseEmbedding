Enduro Royalty Trust Announces Monthly Cash Distribution
Enduro Royalty Trust Announces Monthly Cash Distribution

07/21/2017
 Enduro Royalty Trust Announces Monthly Cash Distribution   Enduro Royalty Trust (NYSE: NDRO) (the “Trust”) today announced a cash distribution to the holders of its units of beneficial interest of $0.011227 per unit, payable on August 14, 2017 to unitholders of record on July 31, 2017. The distribution primarily represents oil production during the month of April 2017 and natural gas production during March 2017. 

  The following table displays underlying oil and natural gas sales volumes and average received wellhead prices attributable to the current and prior month net profits interest calculations.                                   Underlying Sales Volumes       Average Price           Oil           Natural Gas       Oil           Natural Gas           Bbls           Bbls/D       Mcf           Mcf/D       (per Bbl)         (per Mcf)     Current Month       59,930       1,998       309,909         9,997       $   47.45       $   2.48     Prior Month       63,106       2,036       291,314       10,404       $   47.42       $   3.01                                               Oil cash receipts for the properties underlying the Trust totaled $2.8 million for the current month, a decrease of $0.1 million from the prior month calculation primarily as a result of one less day of production in April compared to March. Natural gas cash receipts decreased from $0.9 million in the prior distribution period to $0.8 million in the current month primarily due to a decrease of 18 percent in the realized wellhead price as compared to the prior month, offset by an increase in volumes due to three additional days of production in March as compared to February. The decrease in realized wellhead price was driven by decreases in futures pricing for March, which is the basis upon which a significant portion of the East Texas / North Louisiana gas volumes are sold.   Total direct operating expenses, including lease operating expenses, production and ad valorem taxes, and gathering and transportation expenses, decreased $0.4 million to $2.3 million. The decrease in direct operating expenses is primarily due to lower lease operating expenses. Capital expenditures increased $0.3 million to approximately $650,000. Of the $650,000 in capital expenditures during the current month, $0.5 million relates to a portion of capital for 3 gross wells that are currently being drilled in north Louisiana. Total direct operating expenses and capital expenditures relate to expenses incurred during May 2017.    About Enduro Royalty Trust    Enduro Royalty Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed by Enduro Resource Partners to own a net profits interest representing the right to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas production from certain of Enduro Resource Partners’ properties in the states of Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. As described in the Trust’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the amount of the periodic distributions is expected to fluctuate, depending on the proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, oil and gas prices, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, and the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. Future distributions are expected to be made on a monthly basis. For additional information on the Trust, please visit www.enduroroyaltytrust.com.

Enduro Royalty Trust Is A Good Investment - Enduro Royalty Trust (NYSE:NDRO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Enduro Royalty Trust Is A Good InvestmentNov.14.13 | About: Enduro Royalty (NDRO) Tom Dorsey Research analyst, dividend investing, REITs, master limited partnershipsInvestment DailyMy question for the day is: Is Enduro Royalty Trust (NYSE: NDRO) a worthy investment? First, the background to uncover the facts.
The Enduro Royalty Trust makes its money by pumping oil and natural gas out of the ground and selling it. The two factors that determine the profitability of the trust is the amount it can pump out, and the price it gets.
Enduro Resource Partners LLC (the parent company) estimated in the prospectus when they created Enduro Royalty Trust in 2011 they had 25.6 mboe of oil and 50,859 MMcf of natural gas in the holdings. As of December 31, 2012, the underlying properties had proved reserves of 21.4 million barrels of oil equivalent. The number of wells will continue to rise over the next few years and production numbers will increase. As the earlier wells begin to reduce their production over the years the follow on wells will produce. The top producing years are expected to be from 2013 through 2018. The lack of clarity into the future to estimate longevity of production and account for any new developments in the extraction process that could increase the amount of oil and gas extracted over time is unknown, but there will be a drop in production as the reserves are pumped out.
The price for the oil and gas are determined by the market and there is no method to measure what futures prices will be. One unique effect during the current year of 2013 is the fact that there has not been a hurricane that has threatened the U.S. and forced the closure of pumping wells or the refineries. Due to this fact, there is a surplus of oil and gas products on the market that is depressing prices at this time. The market today has WTI at $93.04 and Brent at $105.81. Natural gas opened at $2.43, and is up over a dollar in Wednesday's trading. With the depressed prices, the revenue will be down and distribution will be lower during the 4Q 2013.
Enduro Royalty Trust is characterized as a perpetual trust. A perpetual trust has the benefit of no limits on production and no end date. This puts investors of Enduro Royalty Trust in a position to profit for the long term. However, Enduro has stated in their prospectus that the trust will dissolve upon the earliest to occur of the following: 1) the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding trust units, and sells the Net Profits Interest, (2) the annual cash available for distribution to the trust is less than $2 million for each of any two consecutive years, (3) the holders of at least 75% of the outstanding trust units vote in favor of dissolution or (4) the trust is judicially dissolved. So, although Enduro is classified a perpetual trust, there is definitely the potential for an end to the trust.

On November 8, 2011, Enduro Resource Partners LLC, conveyed to the Trust, through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Enduro with the Trust, the Net Profits Interest in exchange for 33,000,000 units of beneficial interest in the Trust (the "Trust Units"). Immediately following the conveyance, Enduro completed an initial public offering of 13,200,000 Trust Units. After the completion of the initial public offering and as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, Enduro owned 19,800,000 Trust Units, or 60% of the issued and outstanding Trust Units. On October 2, 2013, Enduro completed a secondary offering of 11,200,000 Trust Units at a price of $13.85 per unit to the public. After the completion of the secondary offering, Enduro now owns 8,600,000 Trust Units, or 26% of the issued and outstanding Trust Units. The trust used the proceeds from the 11.2 million units to reduce their debt to pay down a portion of the outstanding borrowings under its senior secured credit facility. This sale did not affect the total number of units and will not affect the distribution to unit holders.
Enduro Resource Partners LLC, was the largest hold of units and now investors own 74% of the Trust. There is no controlling interest, but the total of all investors do not reach 75% required for action to terminate the Trust. The sale was more beneficial to the company to pay off debt for the long term quality of the trust and the unit holders. The cost of the debt would have been at a higher cost later, and the company now allows more unit holders to reap the profits of the trust.
The 3Q 2013 financial statement reports $19.6 million in oil sales and $7.6 million in natural gas sales for a total of $27.2 million in total sales. Minus operating expenses of $11 million leaves plus $1.5 million for contract settlements leaves $17.7 million net profit. 80% distribution is $14 million for 33 million unit holders provides about $0.15 per unit, per month. This is sustainable.
Now for the math - Is Enduro a good investment? With a stock price of 12.26 (during trading hours on November 13, 2013) and the estimated dividend $0.12 per month ($1.44 per year) that is a yield of 11.7%. The current price is depressed, so lower revenues could be seen for 4Q 2013. As prices rebound and average out over the next 5 years, the return should be strong and continue the double digit return. The stock price should not drop soon (project over the next 5 years while production remains high), but over time with the reserves diminishing, we expect to see the value decrease. There is opportunity for undiscovered reserves from the wells to increase the value and length of time the wells can pump. Time is also a positive for developments and new techniques to recover more oil from wells. One additional advantage with Enduro Royalty Trust, there is no production limit or end date, and if the trust is terminated, the unit holders will likely be eligible to receive compensation for the remaining assets.

My assessment is Enduro Royalty Trust is a good investment that will provide a double-digit returns over the next 5 years without a significant drop in original principle. Investing in this trust the investor must carefully track the remaining reserves and decide if and when is the appropriate time for them to enter or exit this investment.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

      during the month of April 2017 and natural gas production during March 
      2017.
    

      The following table displays underlying oil and natural gas sales

      Oil cash receipts for the properties underlying the Trust totaled $2.8 
      million for the current month, a decrease of $0.1 million from the prior 
      month calculation primarily as a result of one less day of production in 
      April compared to March. Natural gas cash receipts decreased from $0.9 
      million in the prior distribution period to $0.8 million in the current 
      month primarily due to a decrease of 18 percent in the realized wellhead 
      price as compared to the prior month, offset by an increase in volumes 
      due to three additional days of production in March as compared to 
      February. The decrease in realized wellhead price was driven by 
      decreases in futures pricing for March, which is the basis upon which a 
      significant portion of the East Texas / North Louisiana gas volumes are 
      sold.
    

      Total direct operating expenses, including lease operating expenses, 
      production and ad valorem taxes, and gathering and transportation 
      expenses, decreased $0.4 million to $2.3 million. The decrease in direct 
      operating expenses is primarily due to lower lease operating expenses. 
      Capital expenditures increased $0.3 million to approximately $650,000. 
      Of the $650,000 in capital expenditures during the current month, $0.5 
      million relates to a portion of capital for 3 gross wells that are 
      currently being drilled in north Louisiana. Total direct operating 
      expenses and capital expenditures relate to expenses incurred during May 
      2017.
    

About Enduro Royalty Trust


      Enduro Royalty Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed by Enduro 
      Resource Partners to own a net profits interest representing the right 
      to receive 80% of the net profits from the sale of oil and natural gas 
      production from certain of Enduro Resource Partners’ properties in the 
      states of Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico. As described in the Trust’s 
      filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the amount of the 
      periodic distributions is expected to fluctuate, depending on the 
      proceeds received by the Trust as a result of actual production volumes, 
      oil and gas prices, the amount and timing of capital expenditures, and 
      the Trust’s administrative expenses, among other factors. Future 
      distributions are expected to be made on a monthly basis. For additional 
      information on the Trust, please visit www.enduroroyaltytrust.com.
    

Forward-Looking Statements and Cautionary Statements


      This press release contains statements that are “forward-looking 
      statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange 
      Act of 1934, as amended. All statements contained in this press release, 
      other than statements of historical facts, are “forward-looking 
      statements” for purposes of these provisions. These forward-looking 
      statements include the amount and date of any anticipated distribution 
      to unitholders and expected expenses, including capital expenditures. 
      The anticipated distribution is based, in large part, on the amount of 
      cash received or expected to be received by the Trust from Enduro 
      Resource Partners with respect to the relevant period. The amount of 
      such cash received or expected to be received by the Trust (and its 
      ability to pay distributions) has been and will be significantly and 
      negatively affected by prevailing low commodity prices, which have 
      declined significantly, could decline further and could remain low for 
      an extended period of time. Other important factors that could cause 
      actual results to differ materially include expenses of the Trust and 
      reserves for anticipated future expenses. Statements made in this press 
      release are qualified by the cautionary statements made in this press 
      release. Neither Enduro Resource Partners nor the Trustee intends, and 
      neither assumes any obligation, to update any of the statements included 
      in this press release. An investment in units issued by Enduro Royalty 
      Trust is subject to the risks described in the Trust’s filings with the 
      SEC, including the risks described in the Trust’s Annual Report on Form 
      10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC on March 
      15, 2017. The Trust’s quarterly and other filed reports are or will be 
      available over the Internet at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
