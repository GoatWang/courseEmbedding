NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the mutual terms and covenants contained herein, and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are

under the Issuing Entity Documents; provided, however, except as
otherwise provided in the Issuing Entity Documents, that the
Administrator shall have no obligation to make any payment required
to be made by the Issuing Entity under any Issuing Entity Document.
In addition, the Administrator shall consult with the Issuing
Entity and the Owner Trustee regarding its duties and obligations
under the Issuing Entity Documents. The Administrator shall monitor
the performance of



the Issuing Entity and the Owner
Trustee and shall advise the Issuing Entity and the Owner Trustee
when action is necessary to comply with the Issuing Entity’s
and the Owner Trustee’s duties and obligations under the
Issuing Entity Documents. The Administrator shall perform such
calculations, and shall prepare for execution by the Issuing Entity
or the Owner Trustee or shall cause the preparation by other
appropriate persons of all such documents, reports, filings,
instruments, certificates and opinions as it shall be the duty of
the Issuing Entity or the Owner Trustee (in its capacity as owner
trustee) to prepare, file or deliver pursuant to the Issuing Entity
Documents. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Administrator shall
take all appropriate action that is the duty of the Issuing Entity
or the Owner Trustee (in its capacity as owner trustee) to take
pursuant to the Issuing Entity Documents, and shall prepare and
execute on behalf of the Issuing Entity or the Owner Trustee all
such documents, reports, filings, instruments, certificates and
opinions as it shall be the duty of the Issuing Entity or the Owner
Trustee to prepare, file or deliver pursuant to the Issuing Entity
Documents or otherwise by applicable law.

(b) No Action by
Administrator . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Agreement, the Administrator shall not be obligated to, and shall
not, take any action that the Issuing Entity directs the
Administrator not to take or which would result in a violation or
breach of the Issuing Entity’s covenants, agreements or
obligations under any of the Issuing Entity Documents.

(c) Non-Ministerial Matters;
Exceptions to Administrator Duties .

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, with respect to matters that in the
reasonable judgment of the Administrator are non-ministerial, the
Administrator shall not take any action unless, within a reasonable
time before the taking of such action, the Administrator shall have
notified the Issuing Entity of the proposed action and the Issuing
Entity shall not have withheld consent or provided an alternative
direction. For the purpose of the preceding sentence,
“non-ministerial matters” shall include, without
limitation:

(A) the initiation of any claim or
lawsuit by the Issuing Entity and the compromise of any action,
claim or lawsuit brought by or against the Issuing
Entity;

(B) the appointment of successor
Note Registrars, successor Paying Agents, successor Indenture
Trustees, successor Administrators or successor Servicers, or the

and

(C) the removal of the Indenture
Trustee.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Administrator shall not be
obligated to, and shall not, (x) make any payments to the

the Indenture Trustee at any time during normal business
hours.

3. Compensation; Payment of Fees
and Expenses .

obligations under this Agreement and as reimbursement for its
expenses related thereto, the Administrator shall be entitled to

Trustee”) from time to time such compensation as the Issuing

to time agree in writing for services rendered under the Indenture
(which compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation
of a trustee of an express trust);

(ii) unless otherwise paid pursuant

or any Separate Trustee related to such defense;

(v) pay to the Owner Trustee from
time to time compensation for all services rendered by the Owner

compensation of a trustee of an express trust);
 
- 3 -



(vi) reimburse the Owner Trustee
upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and
advances incurred or made by the Owner Trustee in accordance with
any provision of the Trust Agreement (including the reasonable
compensation, expenses and disbursements of such agents and counsel
as the Owner Trustee may employ in connection with the exercise and
performance of its rights and authority and its duties under the
Trust Agreement), except any such expense that may be attributable
to the Owner Trustee’s willful misconduct, gross negligence
or bad faith; and

(vii) indemnify the Owner Trustee in
its individual capacity and as trustee and its successors, assigns,
directors, officers, employees and agents in accordance with
Section 8.02 of the Trust Agreement; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any
other Transaction Document, clauses (i) through
(vii) above shall survive the termination of this
Agreement.

4. Independence of the
Administrator . For all purposes of this Agreement, the
Administrator shall be an independent contractor and shall not be
subject to the supervision of the Issuing Entity or the Owner
Trustee with respect to the manner in which it accomplishes the
performance of its obligations hereunder. Unless expressly
authorized by the Issuing Entity, the Administrator shall have no
authority to act for or to represent the Issuing Entity in any way
(other than as permitted hereunder) and shall not otherwise be
deemed an agent of the Issuing Entity.

5. No Joint Venture . Nothing
contained in this Agreement (i) shall constitute the
Administrator and the Issuing Entity as members of any partnership,
joint venture, association, syndicate, unincorporated business or
other separate entity, (ii) shall be construed to impose any
liability as such on any of them or (iii) shall be deemed to
confer on any of them any express, implied or apparent authority to
incur any obligation or liability on behalf of the
others.

6. Other Activities of the
Administrator . Nothing herein shall prevent the Administrator
or its Affiliates from engaging in other businesses or, in its sole
discretion, from acting in a similar capacity as an Administrator
for any other Person even though such Person may engage in business
activities similar to those of the Issuing Entity, the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee.

7. Representations and Warranties
of the Administrator . The Administrator represents and
warrants to the Issuing Entity and the Indenture Trustee as
follows:

(a) Existence and Power . The
Administrator is a corporation validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of its state of organization and has, in
all material respects, all power and authority to carry on its
business as now conducted. The Administrator has obtained all
necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the
failure to do so would materially and adversely affect the ability
of the Administrator to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents.)
 
- 4 -



(b) Authorization and No
Contravention . The execution, delivery and performance by the
Administrator of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party
(i) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the
part of the Administrator and (ii) do not contravene or
constitute a default under (A) any applicable law, rule or
regulation, (B) its organizational documents or (C) any
material agreement, contract, order or other instrument to which it
is a party or its property is subject (other than violations which
do not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any of
such agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would
not materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated
by, or the Administrator’s ability to perform its obligations
under, the Transaction Documents).

(c) No Consent Required . No
approval or authorization by, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance by the Administrator of any Transaction Document
other than (i) UCC filings, (ii) approvals and
authorizations that have previously been obtained and filings that
have previously been made and (iii) approvals, authorizations
or filings which, if not obtained or made, would not materially and
adversely affect the ability of the Administrator to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents).

(d) Binding Effect . Each
Transaction Document to which the Administrator is a party
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Administrator enforceable against the Administrator in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and, if
applicable, the rights of creditors of limited liability companies
from time to time in effect or by general principles of
equity.

8. Administrator Replacement
Events; Termination of the Administrator .

(a) Subject to clauses (d) and
(e) below, the Administrator may resign its duties hereunder
by providing the Issuing Entity with at least sixty
(60) days’ prior written notice.

(b) Subject to clauses (d) and
(e) below, the Issuing Entity may remove the Administrator
without cause by providing the Administrator with at least sixty

following events (each, an “Administrator Replacement
Event”) shall also entitle the Issuing Entity, subject to
Section 19 hereof, to terminate and replace the
Administrator:

(i) any failure by the Administrator
to deliver or cause to be delivered any required payment to the
Indenture Trustee for distribution to the Noteholders, which
failure continues unremedied for ten business days after discovery
thereof by a Responsible Officer of the Administrator or receipt by
the Administrator of written notice thereof from the Indenture
Trustee or Noteholders evidencing at least a majority of the
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes, voting
together as a single class;
 
- 5 -



(ii) any failure by the
Administrator to duly observe or perform in any material respect
any other of its covenants or agreements in this Agreement, which
failure materially and adversely affects the rights of the Issuing

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the notes issued by World Omni Automobile Lease 
      Securitization Trust 2014-A:
    

      --$104,910,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$305,440,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$213,590,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$80,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$30,130,000 class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: Consistent with prior WOLS pools, 2014-A has 
      a weighted average (WA) FICO score of 746, similar term distribution, 
      and seasoning of 6.75 months. The base residual value percentage has 
      increased modestly to 69.9% from 68.4% for WOLS 2013-A.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: Initial credit enhancement (CE) 
      is expected to be 16.40% and 12.80% of the initial securitization value 
      (SV) for the class A and B notes, growing to 17.90% and 14.30% of the 
      initial SV, respectively. Excess spread is expected to be 3.37%.
    

      Collateral Concentration Risks: The Toyota Camry and Corolla total 32.2% 
      and 13.7% in 2014-A, slightly lower than 2013-A; however, these models 
      have produced low and infrequent residual value (RV) losses. The leases 
      were originated in only five southeastern states consistent with prior 
      deals, the largest being Florida at 67.9%. While, the lease maturities 
      in 2014-A are heavily concentrated in the first half of 2017 (49.6%), 
      the overall portfolio has a WA original term of 36.4, lower than 2013-A.
    

      Unhedged Floating-Rate Class A-2b Note: The class A-2b notes are 
      expected to pay interest on a floating-rate basis while the assets pay a 
      fixed rate and will not be hedged. As such, Fitch has stressed the 
      transaction structure using its 'AAA' and 'AA' LIBOR-up stress 
      assumptions.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Quality of Origination, Underwriting and Servicing Platform: World Omni 
      demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency, credit loss and 
      residual value (RV) loss performance of the managed portfolio and 
      securitizations.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing 
      the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and 
      examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The 
      increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent 
      moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, respectively, and are 
      intended to provide an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to 
      unexpected deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's web site at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      For more information about Fitch's comprehensive subscription service
