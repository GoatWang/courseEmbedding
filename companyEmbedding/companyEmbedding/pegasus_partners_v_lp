Pegasus was founded by Craig Cogut in 1995, 5 years after dealing with virtually all aspects of distressed securities investments and restructurings of Apollo Management, which he and Leon Black and Craig Cogut started at former investment banking power Drexel Burnham Lambert when that bank was besieged by allegations over illegal activities involving high-yield debt.[1]
Cogut established Pegasus to focus on investments in middle-market companies facing financial distress.[1] where returns from deals are more reliant on the actual alpha of the investor.[citation needed] Cogut wanted to concentrate on transactions that could generate returns through revenue growth and operating improvements rather than largely relying on financial leverage.[citation needed]
In October 2016, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California appointed the firm as financial advisor to the R20 Regions of Climate Action to facilitate and implement low-carbon and climate resilient projects.[2]
Funds[edit]
Since 1995, Pegasus has raised five private equity funds with total investor commitments of c. $2 billion.[3][dead link] Pegasus raises the capital from a variety of limited partners that include major public and corporate pension funds, leading endowments, fund of funds and family offices. It closed its fourth private equity fund in January 2007, hitting the US$750 million cap that had been set and its fifth fund in April 2012.[4][dead link]

Pegasus Partners I (1995) - $220 million[citation needed]
Pegasus Partners II (1999) - $561 million[5]
Pegasus Partners III (2004) - $316 million[5]
Pegasus Partners IV (2007) - $750 million[5]
Pegasus Partners V (2012) - $700 million[citation needed]

As of December 31, 2015, funds II, III, IV, and V achieved returns of 15.96%, 1.77%, -0.30%, and 9.92%, respectively.[6]
Portfolio[edit]
Since 1995, Pegasus has invested in more than 70 companies.[citation needed] The firm tends to invest in the consumer products, technology, business services, energy, financial services, industrial manufacturing and communications sectors.[citation needed] selected companies of the firm's investments are:[citation needed]

Universal Lubricants
Molycorp Minerals
Lighting Science
iGPS
Traxys
Cannondale Bicycle Corporation[7]
Jenzabar
PSI
Carol's Daughter
ImageSat International
NSI
Spirit Music Group
T&M Protection Resources
Hain Pure Protein Corporation

Competitors[edit]
Pegasus competes with other major private equity players in the middle-market, including Kohlberg & Company, Audax Group, Berkshire Partners, Golden Gate Capital, and Madison Dearborn Partners.[citation needed]

Pegasus was founded by Craig Cogut in 1995, 5 years after dealing with virtually all aspects of distressed securities investments and restructurings of Apollo Management, which he and Leon Black and Craig Cogut started at former investment banking power Drexel Burnham Lambert when that bank was besieged by allegations over illegal activities involving high-yield debt.[1]
Cogut established Pegasus to focus on investments in middle-market companies facing financial distress.[1] where returns from deals are more reliant on the actual alpha of the investor.[citation needed] Cogut wanted to concentrate on transactions that could generate returns through revenue growth and operating improvements rather than largely relying on financial leverage.[citation needed]
In October 2016, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California appointed the firm as financial advisor to the R20 Regions of Climate Action to facilitate and implement low-carbon and climate resilient projects.[2]
Funds[edit]
Since 1995, Pegasus has raised five private equity funds with total investor commitments of c. $2 billion.[3][dead link] Pegasus raises the capital from a variety of limited partners that include major public and corporate pension funds, leading endowments, fund of funds and family offices. It closed its fourth private equity fund in January 2007, hitting the US$750 million cap that had been set and its fifth fund in April 2012.[4][dead link]

Pegasus Partners II (1999) - $561 million[5]
Pegasus Partners III (2004) - $316 million[5]
Pegasus Partners IV (2007) - $750 million[5]
Pegasus Partners V (2012) - $700 million[citation needed]

As of December 31, 2015, funds II, III, IV, and V achieved returns of 15.96%, 1.77%, -0.30%, and 9.92%, respectively.[6]
Portfolio[edit]
Since 1995, Pegasus has invested in more than 70 companies.[citation needed] The firm tends to invest in the consumer products, technology, business services, energy, financial services, industrial manufacturing and communications sectors.[citation needed] selected companies of the firm's investments are:[citation needed]
