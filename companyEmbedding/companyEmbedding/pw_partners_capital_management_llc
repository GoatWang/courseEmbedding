Day in the Life

												Simon Clarke											

													Director												

As a member of the Advisory team at PWP, my role is to provide clear and strategic advice to my clients in order to help them achieve the best outcomes for their business. Every day, our clients present us with a myriad of complex problems which can include conducting financial analysis of business and industry trends, identifying future M&A opportunities, managing a sales process or conducting valuation analysis. The diverse nature of our client needs presents interesting and unique challenges that require innovative and thoughtful advice. Often times, we must balance several assignments which are at various stages of completion and this requires you to anticipate clients’ needs and work efficiently to produce results. One of the many thrills of working at PWP is the ability to engage with our clients in meaningful ways whilst being surrounded and supported by friendly and inspiring colleagues.

Day in the Life

												Tulika Garg											

													Director												

As a Director at PWP, at a high level, my role is performing and reviewing analysis to solve our clients’ problems and anticipating needs that might come up in the future. These could be related to identifying, evaluating and executing mergers and acquisitions, or corporate restructurings. Most days involve engaging with clients on ongoing transactions, presenting new ideas or discussing latest market trends to keep them up to speed on the opportunities and risks from pursuing different strategic paths. A typical day includes balancing working with analysts to ensure the analysis and work product creation is going smoothly, and communicating with the senior team so that they are aligned on the conclusions from the analysis. Each day also brings with it many atypical challenges and unique issues facing our clients, and with them, a chance to learn something new.

Our Principles
We are devoted to providing unmatched advisory and asset management services to clients based on high quality independent, financial expertise. Our Business Principles are our values and articulate the Firm’s culture and how we engage with clients. Our entire culture is predicated on trust and experience. Our professionals share an uncompromised dedication to excellence and integrity worldwide.

Business Principles

Clients are everything to us. When we engage with an advisory or investing client, we agree not only to represent them, but to fight for them if the circumstances require it.
We are an entrepreneurial and nimble Firm, unencumbered by bureaucracy and politics. We should use this advantage in every way possible, both internally and externally.
Transparency is vital to our identity, our culture and our success. Complex problems are a prominent feature of our industry and are best solved by early warning, open discussion and a sharing of ideas.
We embrace diversity, not merely because it’s right, but because it creates the most interesting, vibrant and commercial environment.
“I trust you” is the highest compliment we can receive from an advisory client, an investor or a colleague. We should aspire to be the most trusted Firm in our industry.
It takes a special kind of person to enjoy and prosper in our Firm. Our people succeed through their wits, their experience, their relationships and their creativity; without the benefit of armies of people or a huge balance sheet.
While our business model hinges on having experienced senior people with exceptional reputations, our more junior people are the lifeblood of the Firm. We cannot be successful without fully developing the next generation to take the place of the current partners.
Our partnership extends beyond our partners. Every person in the Firm should be devoted, first and foremost, to the Firm’s reputation and well-being. Self-centered or “silo” behavior is antithetical to who we are.
At our Firm, personal ambition and teamwork go hand in hand. Let’s always venerate individual creativity and drive, mindful that each of us, and therefore the Firm, performs most effectively when we operate in a collegial manner.
Every day, we have an obligation to protect, uphold and enhance our reputation.

Asset Management - Perella Weinberg Partners





















































Skip to content




From Insight, Opportunity
Sophisticated investors turn to Perella Weinberg Partners for distinct alternative investment solutions.







PWP is a leading global institutional asset manager with an unwavering focus on investors’ needs.
We derive an “investment edge” through harnessing the brightest investment minds around the globe. Across investment strategies, we achieve our objectives of producing attractive risk-adjusted returns in a variety of market environments because of our experience, expertise, and disciplined investment approach. Our investors benefit from this edge across public and private instruments, spanning equity, credit, and real asset investments, both through our direct alternatives and our outsourced CIO capabilities. Today PWP oversees approximately $13.1 billion in assets under management.





Agility / Your Outsourced Investment Solution
Overview
PWP created the Agility platform to provide your organization an Outsourced Investment Team with comprehensive capabilities that can offer customized programs to meet your individual investment requirements. Our team of professionals has decades of experience and executes a proven and disciplined due diligence process to identify and invest with top managers across asset classes.
Value Proposition
Today, the investment landscape is global and more complex than ever. At many institutions, investment management is often under-resourced, and attracting and retaining specialized in-house investment talent is both difficult and expensive. To be an effective fiduciary now requires an institutional approach involving investment, risk management, legal, compliance, and operational expertise. With Agility, PWP can serve as an extension of your staff or volunteer board and offer customized investment programs designed to complement the remainder of your portfolio.
Approach
The Agility platform’s success is ultimately built upon a close, strategic partnership between you and the Agility Investment Team. With a long-term horizon, we construct diversified portfolios by investing across geographies, asset classes, managers, and positions. We use a detailed, proprietary methodology as well as internal and external tools to measure and manage risk in your portfolio. Combined with the support of experienced legal, compliance, risk management, trading and operational teams, we create a customized investment program to complement and enhance your portfolio.

Asset Based Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy emphasizes capital preservation and cash flow generation from assets purchased at attractive current cash yields and equity-like upside optionality.
Strategy Overview
Our Asset Based Opportunities strategy seeks to uncover mispriced asset based investment opportunities through fundamental analysis and in-depth understanding of asset valuation.
Current market dislocation, including illiquidity, repricing of assets, deleveraging, and regulatory changes, create compelling asset based investment opportunities.
Assets targeted for investment are real assets, including rail cars, aircrafts, vessels, working interests in oil and gas, and commercial real estate and financial assets, including auto loans, credit card loans, franchise loans and equipment lending, small business loans, and other consumer assets.




Diversified Equities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy represents a combination of tactical long/short equity investing and event-driven equity investing within the context of a diversified, low-net portfolio of mid and large cap equities.
Strategy Overview
In the short to medium term the fundamental drivers of stocks can often be diluted or even overridden by other influencers of stock prices such as technicals, macro/thematic factors and behavioral sentiment. As a result, PWP has developed an iterative ‘multiple-lens’ approach that takes into account all of these considerations in developing portfolio construction and managing risk.
To achieve its objective, the strategy invests in both select long and short equity opportunities and event-driven opportunities with a hard catalyst. The strategy leverages significant knowledge synergies between the two strategies and maintains a flexible investment mandate across such strategies in order to take advantage of opportunities presented by the market.

Global Macro
Investment Philosophy
This strategy is highly liquid, investing in equity indices, currencies, sovereign debt, credit, and commodities with a strong focus on risk management in an effort to limit the frequency and severity of drawdowns.
Strategy Overview
The investment strategy is based on fundamental macro-economic research to establish predictive relationships between macro-economic factors and asset returns. These principles are implemented in a rigorous, systematic investment framework. The goal of the strategy is to estimate the dynamics of risk premia across all liquid assets globally in order to identify opportunities to deploy risk to maximize reward. The investment approach incorporates analysis of the current economic environment as well as prediction of the evolution of the business cycle across multiple regions.

TPH Energy Equities Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This long-only diversified equity strategy focuses on concentrated positions in publicly traded energy equities predominately in North America.
Strategy Overview
The strategy was first deployed in early 2015 to take advantage of one of the most severe corrections in the energy markets since the 1980s. It is a fundamentally-driven, concentrated, long-only equity strategy focused on the “best energy ideas” of the Portfolio Manager. The strategy invests in a concentrated portfolio of public equities focused primarily on the upstream and oilfield service subsectors.

TPH MLP
Investment Philosophy
This is a diversified long-only strategy focused on midstream energy equities and Master Limited Partnerships.
Strategy Overview
The TPH MLP strategy seeks to generate long-term returns in the form of capital appreciation and income.  The strategy predominately invests in North American opportunities with minimal exposure in developed energy economies outside of the U.S.
The strategy’s unique process and coverage of the entire energy infrastructure spectrum, leads to differentiated stock selection with minimal overlap with leading peer funds.  The strategy leverages TPH’s deep technical energy expertise (e.g., engineers, geologists, and energy professionals) that encompasses the full energy value chain.



Portfolio Manager
Diego Kuschnir

    Meet Diego  







TPH Energy Infrastructure
Investment Philosophy
This long/short equity strategy is focused exclusively on energy infrastructure subsectors, such as pipelines, utilities, storage, transmission and water, among others.
Strategy Overview
This strategy is in a small universe of hedged, liquid strategies that invests in the energy infrastructure space. The strategy employs an actively managed portfolio with alpha longs and shorts and proactive hedging to isolate desired exposures and reduce broader energy sector, market, and macro risks.
The strategy seeks to exploit opportunities in the North American energy sector, with a focus on the energy infrastructure spectrum (i.e., midstream/MLP, pipelines, electric and gas utilities, water, transmission, commodity storage, gathering and processing), through investments in liquid, publicly traded securities.
The strategy leverages TPH’s deep technical energy expertise (e.g., engineers, geologists and energy industry professionals) that encompasses the full energy value chain from wellhead to burner tip.



Portfolio Manager
Diego Kuschnir

    Meet Diego  







TPH Private Energy Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy is a merchant-banking style private equity strategy that makes primarily minority stake, non-control investments in companies across the energy industry.
Strategy Overview
This strategy invests in opportunities that provide capital solutions to companies with attractive risk / return profiles during the current energy correction.  Seeded by one of the largest pension funds in the US, the strategy taps into the proprietary deal flow generated across the TPH platform (Advisory, Capital Markets. and Asset Management) to source attractive investment opportunities. The strategy has three targeted investment scenarios in which it seeks to deploy capital: trough-cycle investment opportunities, development opportunities, and structured opportunities.  The strategy’s opportunistic mandate provides a tactical allocation to energy private equity during the most difficult energy environment since the 1980s.



Investment Committee: Dan Pickering, Chansoo Joung, Bobby Tudor







TPH Midstream Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This long-only equity strategy focuses on concentrated positions in publicly traded midstream equities, energy infrastructure equities, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).
Strategy Overview
This is a tactical strategy intended to take advantage of the current energy correction.  The strategy is focused on holding limited, concentrated positions predominately in North American midstream equities, energy infrastructure equities, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).

The TPH MLP strategy seeks to generate long-term returns in the form of capital appreciation and income.  The strategy predominately invests in North American opportunities with minimal exposure in developed energy economies outside of the U.S.
The strategy’s unique process and coverage of the entire energy infrastructure spectrum, leads to differentiated stock selection with minimal overlap with leading peer funds.  The strategy leverages TPH’s deep technical energy expertise (e.g., engineers, geologists, and energy professionals) that encompasses the full energy value chain.

TPH Energy Infrastructure
Investment Philosophy
This long/short equity strategy is focused exclusively on energy infrastructure subsectors, such as pipelines, utilities, storage, transmission and water, among others.
Strategy Overview
This strategy is in a small universe of hedged, liquid strategies that invests in the energy infrastructure space. The strategy employs an actively managed portfolio with alpha longs and shorts and proactive hedging to isolate desired exposures and reduce broader energy sector, market, and macro risks.
The strategy seeks to exploit opportunities in the North American energy sector, with a focus on the energy infrastructure spectrum (i.e., midstream/MLP, pipelines, electric and gas utilities, water, transmission, commodity storage, gathering and processing), through investments in liquid, publicly traded securities.
The strategy leverages TPH’s deep technical energy expertise (e.g., engineers, geologists and energy industry professionals) that encompasses the full energy value chain from wellhead to burner tip.

TPH Private Energy Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy is a merchant-banking style private equity strategy that makes primarily minority stake, non-control investments in companies across the energy industry.
Strategy Overview
This strategy invests in opportunities that provide capital solutions to companies with attractive risk / return profiles during the current energy correction.  Seeded by one of the largest pension funds in the US, the strategy taps into the proprietary deal flow generated across the TPH platform (Advisory, Capital Markets. and Asset Management) to source attractive investment opportunities. The strategy has three targeted investment scenarios in which it seeks to deploy capital: trough-cycle investment opportunities, development opportunities, and structured opportunities.  The strategy’s opportunistic mandate provides a tactical allocation to energy private equity during the most difficult energy environment since the 1980s.



Investment Committee: Dan Pickering, Chansoo Joung, Bobby Tudor







TPH Midstream Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This long-only equity strategy focuses on concentrated positions in publicly traded midstream equities, energy infrastructure equities, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).
Strategy Overview
This is a tactical strategy intended to take advantage of the current energy correction.  The strategy is focused on holding limited, concentrated positions predominately in North American midstream equities, energy infrastructure equities, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

NEW YORK, Jan. 7, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- PW Partners Atlas Funds and HG Vora Capital Management (the "Nominating Stockholders"), who collectively own 6,371,133 shares or 26.2% of the outstanding shares of Town Sports International Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:   CLUB) ("Town Sports" or the "Company"), announced today that they have formally nominated six highly qualified and independent director nominees for election to the Board of Directors of Town Sports at its upcoming 2015 annual meeting of stockholders.  
The Nominating Stockholders released the following statement:
"As stockholders collectively owning more than 26% of Town Sports, we believe the Company needs to significantly revamp its board of directors to effect the changes necessary to maximize stockholder value. We believe our proposed slate of experienced operating and business professionals with significant expertise in the fitness industry and corporate finance will strengthen Town Sports' brands, right-size its cost structure, and make prudent capital allocation decisions for the benefit of all stockholders. The Company has failed to engage in a meaningful dialogue with us regarding our recommendations for enhancing stockholder value. The Company also rebuffed our good faith attempts to obtain meaningful representation on the Board and responded by adopting a 'poison pill' rights plan. Stockholders deserve directors who will proactively address the many issues facing Town Sports and be committed to meaningful value creation."
The Nominating Stockholders' slate of director nominees includes:
Glenn Colarossi (Age 54) who has served as Principal of Colarossi Spa & Health Club Consulting & Management LLC, a health club consulting and management firm providing development, design, branding, management and investment consulting services to health clubs and spas worldwide, since he founded it in 1991. He has also served as Director Global Hospitality of True Fitness Technology Inc., a manufacturer of premium cardio equipment, since December 2013. He was also the Chief Operating Officer of Stamford Athletic Club, an athletic club located in Stamford, CT, from 1993 to December 2013.
Mark A. McEachen (Age 56) who has served as the Chief Executive Officer of The Dolan Company, a leading provider of business information and professional services to the legal, financial, real estate and business sectors, since June 2014. He has also served as a director of BJ's Restaurants, Inc. (NASDAQ:   BJRI), an owner and operator of casual dining restaurants, since April 2014. Mr. McEachen held a variety of positions at Freedom Communications, Inc. from May 2009 to June 2013, including Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer.
Jeffrey C. Neal (Age 69) who has been a Partner of Horizon Capital LLC, an investment company he co-founded specializing in investments in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, since June 2005. He previously served as a director of Caribou Coffee Company, Inc., a leading branded coffee company, from October 2005 to August 2008. Mr. Neal has held a variety of positions at Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. and a predecessor firm from 1973 to 2004, including Chairman of the Global Investment Banking Group.
Thomas W. Plummer (Age 62) who has been the Owner of the National Fitness Business Alliance ("NFBA"), a group of industry vendors and suppliers bringing advanced business education to fitness business owners worldwide, since he founded it in 2003. The NFBA offers seminars, workshops and other consulting services to the fitness industry and is a leading provider of education for fitness business owners. He was also the Founder and Owner of Thomas Plummer Company, a provider of workshops, independent consulting and speaking engagements to the fitness industry, from 1990 to 2003.

He served as a Senior Advisor to TPG Special Situations Partners ("TSSP"), the credit investing arm of TPG Capital, from January 2012 to July 2013. He was a Partner of TSSP from September 2010 to January 2012.
