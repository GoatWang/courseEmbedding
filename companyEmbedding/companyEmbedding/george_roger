History[edit]
In 1904, Harry Berkowitz opened the "Legal Cash Market" in the Inman Square neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts and the name for the market came from the "Legal Stamps", also known as trading stamps, given to loyal customers. The store provided a good living for Harry and his family up until the late 1940s, when chain grocery stores like Stop & Shop and others entered the picture and provided stiff competition for the family business.[6]
In 1950, George Berkowitz, the son of Harry, opened a fish market adjacent to his father's grocery store and named it Legal Sea Foods. This was done to add a degree of specialty to the grocery business by offering customers a fish counter where they could get fresh fish.[6] From the early 1950s the market sold fresh fish as well as fish and chips that could only be taken to-go. In 1968, the Berkowitz family decided to open a restaurant in the adjacent space. They served mainly fish and chips, fried clams, fried shrimp, and fried scallops served on paper plates while the customers sat on picnic tables.[6]
In 1975, the restaurant expanded to a more traditional restaurant at the site of the former S.S. Pierce building in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.[7] In 1980, the original Inman Square restaurant was destroyed in a fire.[8] With the help of his two sons, Marc and Roger, they opened their flagship location in the Park Plaza Hotel in the Boston Theater District of downtown Boston.
1980s[edit]
At the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981, Legal Sea Foods clam chowder was chosen to represent the state of Massachusetts and has been served at every presidential inauguration since.[9] Also in 1981, the restaurant established one of the first quality control centers for fish processing and distribution.
In 1986, Legal Sea Foods was named "Best Seafood Restaurant in America" by NBC's Today Show.[10]
1990s[edit]
In 1990, the restaurant partnered with the United States Department of Commerce in developing a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) program and establishing a landmark fishing industry standard for freshness and food safety.[11]
In 1992, Roger Berkowitz, the son of George, took over as CEO of the private restaurant business. Roger had worked in the family business since the age of ten, and is a graduate of the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.[12] During this time Roger became the company spokesman, and voiced many of the Legal Sea Foods radio commercials, including the award-winning "Fresh Insights" radio campaign.[13]
In March 1994, Food Arts Magazine awarded the Silver Spoon Award to George and Roger Berkowitz for sterling performance and raising Americans' consciousness about seafood for 30 years.[14] Legal also opened their first airport restaurant at Logan International Airport's Terminal C. Later in the year, the restaurant later opened a location in the Philadelphia International Airport. Also in 1994, the restaurant invited chefs from China to fuse Asian cuisine into the menu at the restaurants. This program was called "Cusineast" and some dishes created are still on the current menu.[15]
At the Super Bowl XXXI, hungry fans in New Orleans were treated to New England clam chowder from Legal's Chowda van.[16]
In 1998, Roger Berkowitz was invited to join the Harvard School of Public Health Nutrition Roundtable,[17] a group of people with personal and professional interests in nutrition.[18] It was during 1998, when Bon Appétit magazine named Legal Sea Food one of the Top Ten Tried and True restaurants in America.[19] Rich Vellante also becomes the restaurant group's Executive Chef in 1998 and is currently still in this position.[20]
In 1999, The International Food Manufacturers Association presented Roger Berkowitz with the Silver Plate award for the best full-service, multi-unit restaurant operator in America. This award is the food industry's highest honor.[21]
2000s[edit]
In 2000, the American Institute of Food and Wine sponsored Legal Sea Food's 50th birthday with celebrity chefs, including Julia Child, in attendance.[8] The CBS news program, Eye on America, focused on Legal Sea Food restaurant's quality control program with a segment on food safety.
In 2003, Legal Sea Food restaurants became one of America's first restaurants to go trans-fat free.[22] The New Legal Sea Foods Cookbook was published that year.[23]

In 2005, a new type of restaurant, Legal Test Kitchen (LTK), opened with a menu that is 50 to 60 percent non-seafood and with lower prices than at their more traditional locations.[24] Also in 2005, Legal began to offer gluten-free options on the menu for the first time, giving patrons with celiac disease more dining options.
In 2006, the free-standing Legal Test Kitchen (LTK) opened in the newly developed South Boston Waterfront District in Boston and offers multicultural dining options.[25][26] In 2006, Legal became one of the first restaurants in the United States to allow diners to pay their bill using a table-side device to self-pay.[26]
In 2008, Legal Sea Foods was awarded "#1 Best Family Restaurant" by Parents magazine. And later in the year, Roger Berkowitz was inducted into the Nation's Restaurant News MenuMasters Hall of Fame,[27] and Legal open a new restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia.
In 2009, Legal C Bar opened in Dedham, Massachusetts, focused on serving casual seafood and custom cocktails.[28] Also that year, Cheers magazine gave Legal Sea Foods the two top awards for their outstanding beverage program.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Legal Sea Food celebrated sixty years in business,the restaurants offering clam chowder for 60 cents a cup.
In 2011, Legal opened their new flagship restaurant, Legal Harborside on the Boston waterfront[29] and it was soon named "Best New Restaurant" by Esquire magazine. The Harborside location has a trout fishing pond in the restaurant's main lobby where children can catch and release fish from a licensed indoor fishing pond.[30]
In 2013, Legal Sea Foods announced they would be opening a restaurant in the Downtown Crossing section Boston and the name would be Legal Crossing (LX).
On February 22, 2014, a carbon monoxide leak killed the manager of the Legal Sea Foods at the Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, New York and sickened 27 others. The leak was reportedly caused by a faulty flue pipe attached to a gas water heater. President & CEO of Legal Sea Foods, Roger Berkowitz, said that the company would install carbon monoxide detectors and conduct comprehensive safety audits at all locations. He also pledged to be at the forefront of legislative efforts to require the use of carbon monoxide detectors in commercial buildings.[31][32]
In the fall of 2016, the Peabody, Massachusetts location at the Northshore Mall underwent a complete remodeling.[33]
In April 2017, Legal Fish Bowl debuted in Kendall Square. It’s a fast-casual concept that features six signature bowls as well as the option to make your own.[34]
Legal announced they would be opening a Legal C Bar location in the Garden City section of Cranston, Rhode Island in the winter of 2018/2019. The restaurant will be the anchor of a new 30,000-square-foot building that is part of Garden City Center.[35]
Menu[edit]
The menus vary by location, season and concept, but they all include a wide variety of specialty seafood entrees, appetizers, salads, and desserts. Over 40 varieties of fresh fish and shellfish, simply prepared according to New England tradition, are featured throughout the year. Most popular items include: lobster, clam chowder, fried clams, crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, tuna burgers, baked scrod, surf and turf and grilled fish fillets. Extensive wine lists and full-service bars are also available at all locations and have garnered recognition for its philosophy of offering value at all price points. The restaurant offers separate lunch and dinner menus as well as gluten-free menu options and award-winning kids’ menu.
By buying directly from day boat fishing operations, the company markets itself as having the freshest fish. The company also made industry advances on fish handling and has worked with the federal agencies on developing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP).[36]
In the media[edit]
Bon Appétit magazine touts a meal at Legal Sea Foods as among America's "Top Ten Tried-and-True" dining experiences.[19] Legal is also included in Patricia Schultz's popular guidebook, "1,000 Places to See Before You Die."[37] During 2008 it ran a series of humorous radio advertisements, created by its advertising agency DeVito/Verdi, capping with its aforementioned motto as well as a 'really fresh fish' ad campaign on Boston's trolleys that won industry awards.[38]

The Boston, Massachusetts Legal Sea Foods restaurant sponsored a January 2011 dinner that featured several species of fish which were listed by the advocacy organization Seafood Watch as ones to avoid for sustainability reasons.[39] Legal Sea Foods CEO, Roger Berkowitz said in a statement that much of the science around sustainable fisheries was "flawed" and "outdated."[40] While the protest was criticized by several environmental organizations, it was praised by others, including some in the media. Representatives of fishermen in Gloucester supported the choice to use locally sourced fish.[41]

Advertising and marketing[edit]
In the late summer of 2014, Legal began running print and television spots, in six states and the District of Columbia, that argue that its seafood restaurants should never be called a chain. The series of advertisements, created by the New York advertising firm DeVito/Verdi, uses the restaurant's chief executive, Roger Berkowitz to explain why his seafood restaurants should not be called a chain.[1]
In March 2015, Legal partnered with the ride-sharing company Uber on a promotion to deliver bowls of clam chowder anywhere in the city of Boston. The chowder cost $10 with $1 being donated to the Greater Boston Food Bank.[58]
In 2015, Legal once again teamed up with DeVito/Verdi to launch a multimedia advertising campaign that attempts to establish a new religion whose members will be known as "pescatarians," comparing them to Catholics and Presbyterians. CEO Berkowitz said that the campaign was the widest-reaching to date and spanned all forms of media from print, online, television, and even a gag website.[59] The humorous campaign did face some minor backlash from religious people who were offended by comparing the restaurant to Jesus and Moses.[60]
During the presidential primary of 2016, Legal launched a campaign themed parody produced by DeVito/Verdi. On Super Tuesday, Roger Berkowitz declared himself a candidate for President of the United States in a parody ad campaign of the "fishy" election. Among other things, he promised that on his first day in office he'd legalize seaweed, and he urged voters to #feeltheberk on social media.[61] The spots aired in newspapers, news radio and in print.[62]

History[edit]
In 1904, Harry Berkowitz opened the "Legal Cash Market" in the Inman Square neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts and the name for the market came from the "Legal Stamps", also known as trading stamps, given to loyal customers. The store provided a good living for Harry and his family up until the late 1940s, when chain grocery stores like Stop & Shop and others entered the picture and provided stiff competition for the family business.[6]
In 1950, George Berkowitz, the son of Harry, opened a fish market adjacent to his father's grocery store and named it Legal Sea Foods. This was done to add a degree of specialty to the grocery business by offering customers a fish counter where they could get fresh fish.[6] From the early 1950s the market sold fresh fish as well as fish and chips that could only be taken to-go. In 1968, the Berkowitz family decided to open a restaurant in the adjacent space. They served mainly fish and chips, fried clams, fried shrimp, and fried scallops served on paper plates while the customers sat on picnic tables.[6]
In 1975, the restaurant expanded to a more traditional restaurant at the site of the former S.S. Pierce building in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.[7] In 1980, the original Inman Square restaurant was destroyed in a fire.[8] With the help of his two sons, Marc and Roger, they opened their flagship location in the Park Plaza Hotel in the Boston Theater District of downtown Boston.
1980s[edit]
At the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981, Legal Sea Foods clam chowder was chosen to represent the state of Massachusetts and has been served at every presidential inauguration since.[9] Also in 1981, the restaurant established one of the first quality control centers for fish processing and distribution.
In 1986, Legal Sea Foods was named "Best Seafood Restaurant in America" by NBC's Today Show.[10]
1990s[edit]
In 1990, the restaurant partnered with the United States Department of Commerce in developing a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) program and establishing a landmark fishing industry standard for freshness and food safety.[11]
In 1992, Roger Berkowitz, the son of George, took over as CEO of the private restaurant business. Roger had worked in the family business since the age of ten, and is a graduate of the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.[12] During this time Roger became the company spokesman, and voiced many of the Legal Sea Foods radio commercials, including the award-winning "Fresh Insights" radio campaign.[13]
In March 1994, Food Arts Magazine awarded the Silver Spoon Award to George and Roger Berkowitz for sterling performance and raising Americans' consciousness about seafood for 30 years.[14] Legal also opened their first airport restaurant at Logan International Airport's Terminal C. Later in the year, the restaurant later opened a location in the Philadelphia International Airport. Also in 1994, the restaurant invited chefs from China to fuse Asian cuisine into the menu at the restaurants. This program was called "Cusineast" and some dishes created are still on the current menu.[15]
At the Super Bowl XXXI, hungry fans in New Orleans were treated to New England clam chowder from Legal's Chowda van.[16]
In 1998, Roger Berkowitz was invited to join the Harvard School of Public Health Nutrition Roundtable,[17] a group of people with personal and professional interests in nutrition.[18] It was during 1998, when Bon Appétit magazine named Legal Sea Food one of the Top Ten Tried and True restaurants in America.[19] Rich Vellante also becomes the restaurant group's Executive Chef in 1998 and is currently still in this position.[20]
In 1999, The International Food Manufacturers Association presented Roger Berkowitz with the Silver Plate award for the best full-service, multi-unit restaurant operator in America. This award is the food industry's highest honor.[21]
2000s[edit]
In 2000, the American Institute of Food and Wine sponsored Legal Sea Food's 50th birthday with celebrity chefs, including Julia Child, in attendance.[8] The CBS news program, Eye on America, focused on Legal Sea Food restaurant's quality control program with a segment on food safety.
In 2003, Legal Sea Food restaurants became one of America's first restaurants to go trans-fat free.[22] The New Legal Sea Foods Cookbook was published that year.[23]

In 2005, a new type of restaurant, Legal Test Kitchen (LTK), opened with a menu that is 50 to 60 percent non-seafood and with lower prices than at their more traditional locations.[24] Also in 2005, Legal began to offer gluten-free options on the menu for the first time, giving patrons with celiac disease more dining options.
In 2006, the free-standing Legal Test Kitchen (LTK) opened in the newly developed South Boston Waterfront District in Boston and offers multicultural dining options.[25][26] In 2006, Legal became one of the first restaurants in the United States to allow diners to pay their bill using a table-side device to self-pay.[26]
In 2008, Legal Sea Foods was awarded "#1 Best Family Restaurant" by Parents magazine. And later in the year, Roger Berkowitz was inducted into the Nation's Restaurant News MenuMasters Hall of Fame,[27] and Legal open a new restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia.
In 2009, Legal C Bar opened in Dedham, Massachusetts, focused on serving casual seafood and custom cocktails.[28] Also that year, Cheers magazine gave Legal Sea Foods the two top awards for their outstanding beverage program.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Legal Sea Food celebrated sixty years in business,the restaurants offering clam chowder for 60 cents a cup.
In 2011, Legal opened their new flagship restaurant, Legal Harborside on the Boston waterfront[29] and it was soon named "Best New Restaurant" by Esquire magazine. The Harborside location has a trout fishing pond in the restaurant's main lobby where children can catch and release fish from a licensed indoor fishing pond.[30]
In 2013, Legal Sea Foods announced they would be opening a restaurant in the Downtown Crossing section Boston and the name would be Legal Crossing (LX).
On February 22, 2014, a carbon monoxide leak killed the manager of the Legal Sea Foods at the Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, New York and sickened 27 others. The leak was reportedly caused by a faulty flue pipe attached to a gas water heater. President & CEO of Legal Sea Foods, Roger Berkowitz, said that the company would install carbon monoxide detectors and conduct comprehensive safety audits at all locations. He also pledged to be at the forefront of legislative efforts to require the use of carbon monoxide detectors in commercial buildings.[31][32]
In the fall of 2016, the Peabody, Massachusetts location at the Northshore Mall underwent a complete remodeling.[33]
In April 2017, Legal Fish Bowl debuted in Kendall Square. It’s a fast-casual concept that features six signature bowls as well as the option to make your own.[34]
Legal announced they would be opening a Legal C Bar location in the Garden City section of Cranston, Rhode Island in the winter of 2018/2019. The restaurant will be the anchor of a new 30,000-square-foot building that is part of Garden City Center.[35]
Menu[edit]
The menus vary by location, season and concept, but they all include a wide variety of specialty seafood entrees, appetizers, salads, and desserts. Over 40 varieties of fresh fish and shellfish, simply prepared according to New England tradition, are featured throughout the year. Most popular items include: lobster, clam chowder, fried clams, crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, tuna burgers, baked scrod, surf and turf and grilled fish fillets. Extensive wine lists and full-service bars are also available at all locations and have garnered recognition for its philosophy of offering value at all price points. The restaurant offers separate lunch and dinner menus as well as gluten-free menu options and award-winning kids’ menu.
By buying directly from day boat fishing operations, the company markets itself as having the freshest fish. The company also made industry advances on fish handling and has worked with the federal agencies on developing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP).[36]
In the media[edit]
Bon Appétit magazine touts a meal at Legal Sea Foods as among America's "Top Ten Tried-and-True" dining experiences.[19] Legal is also included in Patricia Schultz's popular guidebook, "1,000 Places to See Before You Die."[37] During 2008 it ran a series of humorous radio advertisements, created by its advertising agency DeVito/Verdi, capping with its aforementioned motto as well as a 'really fresh fish' ad campaign on Boston's trolleys that won industry awards.[38]

The Boston, Massachusetts Legal Sea Foods restaurant sponsored a January 2011 dinner that featured several species of fish which were listed by the advocacy organization Seafood Watch as ones to avoid for sustainability reasons.[39] Legal Sea Foods CEO, Roger Berkowitz said in a statement that much of the science around sustainable fisheries was "flawed" and "outdated."[40] While the protest was criticized by several environmental organizations, it was praised by others, including some in the media. Representatives of fishermen in Gloucester supported the choice to use locally sourced fish.[41]

Advertising and marketing[edit]
In the late summer of 2014, Legal began running print and television spots, in six states and the District of Columbia, that argue that its seafood restaurants should never be called a chain. The series of advertisements, created by the New York advertising firm DeVito/Verdi, uses the restaurant's chief executive, Roger Berkowitz to explain why his seafood restaurants should not be called a chain.[1]
In March 2015, Legal partnered with the ride-sharing company Uber on a promotion to deliver bowls of clam chowder anywhere in the city of Boston. The chowder cost $10 with $1 being donated to the Greater Boston Food Bank.[58]
In 2015, Legal once again teamed up with DeVito/Verdi to launch a multimedia advertising campaign that attempts to establish a new religion whose members will be known as "pescatarians," comparing them to Catholics and Presbyterians. CEO Berkowitz said that the campaign was the widest-reaching to date and spanned all forms of media from print, online, television, and even a gag website.[59] The humorous campaign did face some minor backlash from religious people who were offended by comparing the restaurant to Jesus and Moses.[60]
During the presidential primary of 2016, Legal launched a campaign themed parody produced by DeVito/Verdi. On Super Tuesday, Roger Berkowitz declared himself a candidate for President of the United States in a parody ad campaign of the "fishy" election. Among other things, he promised that on his first day in office he'd legalize seaweed, and he urged voters to #feeltheberk on social media.[61] The spots aired in newspapers, news radio and in print.[62]

History[edit]
In 1904, Harry Berkowitz opened the "Legal Cash Market" in the Inman Square neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts and the name for the market came from the "Legal Stamps", also known as trading stamps, given to loyal customers. The store provided a good living for Harry and his family up until the late 1940s, when chain grocery stores like Stop & Shop and others entered the picture and provided stiff competition for the family business.[6]
In 1950, George Berkowitz, the son of Harry, opened a fish market adjacent to his father's grocery store and named it Legal Sea Foods. This was done to add a degree of specialty to the grocery business by offering customers a fish counter where they could get fresh fish.[6] From the early 1950s the market sold fresh fish as well as fish and chips that could only be taken to-go. In 1968, the Berkowitz family decided to open a restaurant in the adjacent space. They served mainly fish and chips, fried clams, fried shrimp, and fried scallops served on paper plates while the customers sat on picnic tables.[6]
In 1975, the restaurant expanded to a more traditional restaurant at the site of the former S.S. Pierce building in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.[7] In 1980, the original Inman Square restaurant was destroyed in a fire.[8] With the help of his two sons, Marc and Roger, they opened their flagship location in the Park Plaza Hotel in the Boston Theater District of downtown Boston.
1980s[edit]
At the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981, Legal Sea Foods clam chowder was chosen to represent the state of Massachusetts and has been served at every presidential inauguration since.[9] Also in 1981, the restaurant established one of the first quality control centers for fish processing and distribution.
In 1986, Legal Sea Foods was named "Best Seafood Restaurant in America" by NBC's Today Show.[10]
1990s[edit]
In 1990, the restaurant partnered with the United States Department of Commerce in developing a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) program and establishing a landmark fishing industry standard for freshness and food safety.[11]
In 1992, Roger Berkowitz, the son of George, took over as CEO of the private restaurant business. Roger had worked in the family business since the age of ten, and is a graduate of the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.[12] During this time Roger became the company spokesman, and voiced many of the Legal Sea Foods radio commercials, including the award-winning "Fresh Insights" radio campaign.[13]
In March 1994, Food Arts Magazine awarded the Silver Spoon Award to George and Roger Berkowitz for sterling performance and raising Americans' consciousness about seafood for 30 years.[14] Legal also opened their first airport restaurant at Logan International Airport's Terminal C. Later in the year, the restaurant later opened a location in the Philadelphia International Airport. Also in 1994, the restaurant invited chefs from China to fuse Asian cuisine into the menu at the restaurants. This program was called "Cusineast" and some dishes created are still on the current menu.[15]
At the Super Bowl XXXI, hungry fans in New Orleans were treated to New England clam chowder from Legal's Chowda van.[16]
In 1998, Roger Berkowitz was invited to join the Harvard School of Public Health Nutrition Roundtable,[17] a group of people with personal and professional interests in nutrition.[18] It was during 1998, when Bon Appétit magazine named Legal Sea Food one of the Top Ten Tried and True restaurants in America.[19] Rich Vellante also becomes the restaurant group's Executive Chef in 1998 and is currently still in this position.[20]
In 1999, The International Food Manufacturers Association presented Roger Berkowitz with the Silver Plate award for the best full-service, multi-unit restaurant operator in America. This award is the food industry's highest honor.[21]
2000s[edit]
In 2000, the American Institute of Food and Wine sponsored Legal Sea Food's 50th birthday with celebrity chefs, including Julia Child, in attendance.[8] The CBS news program, Eye on America, focused on Legal Sea Food restaurant's quality control program with a segment on food safety.
In 2003, Legal Sea Food restaurants became one of America's first restaurants to go trans-fat free.[22] The New Legal Sea Foods Cookbook was published that year.[23]

In 2005, a new type of restaurant, Legal Test Kitchen (LTK), opened with a menu that is 50 to 60 percent non-seafood and with lower prices than at their more traditional locations.[24] Also in 2005, Legal began to offer gluten-free options on the menu for the first time, giving patrons with celiac disease more dining options.
In 2006, the free-standing Legal Test Kitchen (LTK) opened in the newly developed South Boston Waterfront District in Boston and offers multicultural dining options.[25][26] In 2006, Legal became one of the first restaurants in the United States to allow diners to pay their bill using a table-side device to self-pay.[26]
In 2008, Legal Sea Foods was awarded "#1 Best Family Restaurant" by Parents magazine. And later in the year, Roger Berkowitz was inducted into the Nation's Restaurant News MenuMasters Hall of Fame,[27] and Legal open a new restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia.
In 2009, Legal C Bar opened in Dedham, Massachusetts, focused on serving casual seafood and custom cocktails.[28] Also that year, Cheers magazine gave Legal Sea Foods the two top awards for their outstanding beverage program.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Legal Sea Food celebrated sixty years in business,the restaurants offering clam chowder for 60 cents a cup.
In 2011, Legal opened their new flagship restaurant, Legal Harborside on the Boston waterfront[29] and it was soon named "Best New Restaurant" by Esquire magazine. The Harborside location has a trout fishing pond in the restaurant's main lobby where children can catch and release fish from a licensed indoor fishing pond.[30]
In 2013, Legal Sea Foods announced they would be opening a restaurant in the Downtown Crossing section Boston and the name would be Legal Crossing (LX).
On February 22, 2014, a carbon monoxide leak killed the manager of the Legal Sea Foods at the Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, New York and sickened 27 others. The leak was reportedly caused by a faulty flue pipe attached to a gas water heater. President & CEO of Legal Sea Foods, Roger Berkowitz, said that the company would install carbon monoxide detectors and conduct comprehensive safety audits at all locations. He also pledged to be at the forefront of legislative efforts to require the use of carbon monoxide detectors in commercial buildings.[31][32]
In the fall of 2016, the Peabody, Massachusetts location at the Northshore Mall underwent a complete remodeling.[33]
In April 2017, Legal Fish Bowl debuted in Kendall Square. It’s a fast-casual concept that features six signature bowls as well as the option to make your own.[34]
Legal announced they would be opening a Legal C Bar location in the Garden City section of Cranston, Rhode Island in the winter of 2018/2019. The restaurant will be the anchor of a new 30,000-square-foot building that is part of Garden City Center.[35]
Menu[edit]
The menus vary by location, season and concept, but they all include a wide variety of specialty seafood entrees, appetizers, salads, and desserts. Over 40 varieties of fresh fish and shellfish, simply prepared according to New England tradition, are featured throughout the year. Most popular items include: lobster, clam chowder, fried clams, crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, tuna burgers, baked scrod, surf and turf and grilled fish fillets. Extensive wine lists and full-service bars are also available at all locations and have garnered recognition for its philosophy of offering value at all price points. The restaurant offers separate lunch and dinner menus as well as gluten-free menu options and award-winning kids’ menu.
By buying directly from day boat fishing operations, the company markets itself as having the freshest fish. The company also made industry advances on fish handling and has worked with the federal agencies on developing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP).[36]
In the media[edit]
Bon Appétit magazine touts a meal at Legal Sea Foods as among America's "Top Ten Tried-and-True" dining experiences.[19] Legal is also included in Patricia Schultz's popular guidebook, "1,000 Places to See Before You Die."[37] During 2008 it ran a series of humorous radio advertisements, created by its advertising agency DeVito/Verdi, capping with its aforementioned motto as well as a 'really fresh fish' ad campaign on Boston's trolleys that won industry awards.[38]

The Boston, Massachusetts Legal Sea Foods restaurant sponsored a January 2011 dinner that featured several species of fish which were listed by the advocacy organization Seafood Watch as ones to avoid for sustainability reasons.[39] Legal Sea Foods CEO, Roger Berkowitz said in a statement that much of the science around sustainable fisheries was "flawed" and "outdated."[40] While the protest was criticized by several environmental organizations, it was praised by others, including some in the media. Representatives of fishermen in Gloucester supported the choice to use locally sourced fish.[41]

Advertising and marketing[edit]
In the late summer of 2014, Legal began running print and television spots, in six states and the District of Columbia, that argue that its seafood restaurants should never be called a chain. The series of advertisements, created by the New York advertising firm DeVito/Verdi, uses the restaurant's chief executive, Roger Berkowitz to explain why his seafood restaurants should not be called a chain.[1]
In March 2015, Legal partnered with the ride-sharing company Uber on a promotion to deliver bowls of clam chowder anywhere in the city of Boston. The chowder cost $10 with $1 being donated to the Greater Boston Food Bank.[58]
In 2015, Legal once again teamed up with DeVito/Verdi to launch a multimedia advertising campaign that attempts to establish a new religion whose members will be known as "pescatarians," comparing them to Catholics and Presbyterians. CEO Berkowitz said that the campaign was the widest-reaching to date and spanned all forms of media from print, online, television, and even a gag website.[59] The humorous campaign did face some minor backlash from religious people who were offended by comparing the restaurant to Jesus and Moses.[60]
During the presidential primary of 2016, Legal launched a campaign themed parody produced by DeVito/Verdi. On Super Tuesday, Roger Berkowitz declared himself a candidate for President of the United States in a parody ad campaign of the "fishy" election. Among other things, he promised that on his first day in office he'd legalize seaweed, and he urged voters to #feeltheberk on social media.[61] The spots aired in newspapers, news radio and in print.[62]

History[edit]
In 1904, Harry Berkowitz opened the "Legal Cash Market" in the Inman Square neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts and the name for the market came from the "Legal Stamps", also known as trading stamps, given to loyal customers. The store provided a good living for Harry and his family up until the late 1940s, when chain grocery stores like Stop & Shop and others entered the picture and provided stiff competition for the family business.[6]
In 1950, George Berkowitz, the son of Harry, opened a fish market adjacent to his father's grocery store and named it Legal Sea Foods. This was done to add a degree of specialty to the grocery business by offering customers a fish counter where they could get fresh fish.[6] From the early 1950s the market sold fresh fish as well as fish and chips that could only be taken to-go. In 1968, the Berkowitz family decided to open a restaurant in the adjacent space. They served mainly fish and chips, fried clams, fried shrimp, and fried scallops served on paper plates while the customers sat on picnic tables.[6]
In 1975, the restaurant expanded to a more traditional restaurant at the site of the former S.S. Pierce building in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.[7] In 1980, the original Inman Square restaurant was destroyed in a fire.[8] With the help of his two sons, Marc and Roger, they opened their flagship location in the Park Plaza Hotel in the Boston Theater District of downtown Boston.
1980s[edit]
At the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981, Legal Sea Foods clam chowder was chosen to represent the state of Massachusetts and has been served at every presidential inauguration since.[9] Also in 1981, the restaurant established one of the first quality control centers for fish processing and distribution.
In 1986, Legal Sea Foods was named "Best Seafood Restaurant in America" by NBC's Today Show.[10]
1990s[edit]
In 1990, the restaurant partnered with the United States Department of Commerce in developing a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) program and establishing a landmark fishing industry standard for freshness and food safety.[11]
In 1992, Roger Berkowitz, the son of George, took over as CEO of the private restaurant business. Roger had worked in the family business since the age of ten, and is a graduate of the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.[12] During this time Roger became the company spokesman, and voiced many of the Legal Sea Foods radio commercials, including the award-winning "Fresh Insights" radio campaign.[13]
In March 1994, Food Arts Magazine awarded the Silver Spoon Award to George and Roger Berkowitz for sterling performance and raising Americans' consciousness about seafood for 30 years.[14] Legal also opened their first airport restaurant at Logan International Airport's Terminal C. Later in the year, the restaurant later opened a location in the Philadelphia International Airport. Also in 1994, the restaurant invited chefs from China to fuse Asian cuisine into the menu at the restaurants. This program was called "Cusineast" and some dishes created are still on the current menu.[15]
At the Super Bowl XXXI, hungry fans in New Orleans were treated to New England clam chowder from Legal's Chowda van.[16]
In 1998, Roger Berkowitz was invited to join the Harvard School of Public Health Nutrition Roundtable,[17] a group of people with personal and professional interests in nutrition.[18] It was during 1998, when Bon Appétit magazine named Legal Sea Food one of the Top Ten Tried and True restaurants in America.[19] Rich Vellante also becomes the restaurant group's Executive Chef in 1998 and is currently still in this position.[20]
In 1999, The International Food Manufacturers Association presented Roger Berkowitz with the Silver Plate award for the best full-service, multi-unit restaurant operator in America. This award is the food industry's highest honor.[21]
2000s[edit]
In 2000, the American Institute of Food and Wine sponsored Legal Sea Food's 50th birthday with celebrity chefs, including Julia Child, in attendance.[8] The CBS news program, Eye on America, focused on Legal Sea Food restaurant's quality control program with a segment on food safety.
In 2003, Legal Sea Food restaurants became one of America's first restaurants to go trans-fat free.[22] The New Legal Sea Foods Cookbook was published that year.[23]

In 2005, a new type of restaurant, Legal Test Kitchen (LTK), opened with a menu that is 50 to 60 percent non-seafood and with lower prices than at their more traditional locations.[24] Also in 2005, Legal began to offer gluten-free options on the menu for the first time, giving patrons with celiac disease more dining options.
In 2006, the free-standing Legal Test Kitchen (LTK) opened in the newly developed South Boston Waterfront District in Boston and offers multicultural dining options.[25][26] In 2006, Legal became one of the first restaurants in the United States to allow diners to pay their bill using a table-side device to self-pay.[26]
In 2008, Legal Sea Foods was awarded "#1 Best Family Restaurant" by Parents magazine. And later in the year, Roger Berkowitz was inducted into the Nation's Restaurant News MenuMasters Hall of Fame,[27] and Legal open a new restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia.
In 2009, Legal C Bar opened in Dedham, Massachusetts, focused on serving casual seafood and custom cocktails.[28] Also that year, Cheers magazine gave Legal Sea Foods the two top awards for their outstanding beverage program.
2010s[edit]
In 2010, Legal Sea Food celebrated sixty years in business,the restaurants offering clam chowder for 60 cents a cup.
In 2011, Legal opened their new flagship restaurant, Legal Harborside on the Boston waterfront[29] and it was soon named "Best New Restaurant" by Esquire magazine. The Harborside location has a trout fishing pond in the restaurant's main lobby where children can catch and release fish from a licensed indoor fishing pond.[30]
In 2013, Legal Sea Foods announced they would be opening a restaurant in the Downtown Crossing section Boston and the name would be Legal Crossing (LX).
On February 22, 2014, a carbon monoxide leak killed the manager of the Legal Sea Foods at the Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, New York and sickened 27 others. The leak was reportedly caused by a faulty flue pipe attached to a gas water heater. President & CEO of Legal Sea Foods, Roger Berkowitz, said that the company would install carbon monoxide detectors and conduct comprehensive safety audits at all locations. He also pledged to be at the forefront of legislative efforts to require the use of carbon monoxide detectors in commercial buildings.[31][32]
In the fall of 2016, the Peabody, Massachusetts location at the Northshore Mall underwent a complete remodeling.[33]
In April 2017, Legal Fish Bowl debuted in Kendall Square. It’s a fast-casual concept that features six signature bowls as well as the option to make your own.[34]
Legal announced they would be opening a Legal C Bar location in the Garden City section of Cranston, Rhode Island in the winter of 2018/2019. The restaurant will be the anchor of a new 30,000-square-foot building that is part of Garden City Center.[35]
Menu[edit]
The menus vary by location, season and concept, but they all include a wide variety of specialty seafood entrees, appetizers, salads, and desserts. Over 40 varieties of fresh fish and shellfish, simply prepared according to New England tradition, are featured throughout the year. Most popular items include: lobster, clam chowder, fried clams, crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, tuna burgers, baked scrod, surf and turf and grilled fish fillets. Extensive wine lists and full-service bars are also available at all locations and have garnered recognition for its philosophy of offering value at all price points. The restaurant offers separate lunch and dinner menus as well as gluten-free menu options and award-winning kids’ menu.
By buying directly from day boat fishing operations, the company markets itself as having the freshest fish. The company also made industry advances on fish handling and has worked with the federal agencies on developing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP).[36]
In the media[edit]
Bon Appétit magazine touts a meal at Legal Sea Foods as among America's "Top Ten Tried-and-True" dining experiences.[19] Legal is also included in Patricia Schultz's popular guidebook, "1,000 Places to See Before You Die."[37] During 2008 it ran a series of humorous radio advertisements, created by its advertising agency DeVito/Verdi, capping with its aforementioned motto as well as a 'really fresh fish' ad campaign on Boston's trolleys that won industry awards.[38]

The Boston, Massachusetts Legal Sea Foods restaurant sponsored a January 2011 dinner that featured several species of fish which were listed by the advocacy organization Seafood Watch as ones to avoid for sustainability reasons.[39] Legal Sea Foods CEO, Roger Berkowitz said in a statement that much of the science around sustainable fisheries was "flawed" and "outdated."[40] While the protest was criticized by several environmental organizations, it was praised by others, including some in the media. Representatives of fishermen in Gloucester supported the choice to use locally sourced fish.[41]

Advertising and marketing[edit]
In the late summer of 2014, Legal began running print and television spots, in six states and the District of Columbia, that argue that its seafood restaurants should never be called a chain. The series of advertisements, created by the New York advertising firm DeVito/Verdi, uses the restaurant's chief executive, Roger Berkowitz to explain why his seafood restaurants should not be called a chain.[1]
In March 2015, Legal partnered with the ride-sharing company Uber on a promotion to deliver bowls of clam chowder anywhere in the city of Boston. The chowder cost $10 with $1 being donated to the Greater Boston Food Bank.[58]
In 2015, Legal once again teamed up with DeVito/Verdi to launch a multimedia advertising campaign that attempts to establish a new religion whose members will be known as "pescatarians," comparing them to Catholics and Presbyterians. CEO Berkowitz said that the campaign was the widest-reaching to date and spanned all forms of media from print, online, television, and even a gag website.[59] The humorous campaign did face some minor backlash from religious people who were offended by comparing the restaurant to Jesus and Moses.[60]
During the presidential primary of 2016, Legal launched a campaign themed parody produced by DeVito/Verdi. On Super Tuesday, Roger Berkowitz declared himself a candidate for President of the United States in a parody ad campaign of the "fishy" election. Among other things, he promised that on his first day in office he'd legalize seaweed, and he urged voters to #feeltheberk on social media.[61] The spots aired in newspapers, news radio and in print.[62]

In 1904, Harry Berkowitz opened the "Legal Cash Market" in the Inman Square neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts and the name for the market came from the "Legal Stamps", also known as trading stamps, given to loyal customers. The store provided a good living for Harry and his family up until the late 1940s, when chain grocery stores like Stop & Shop and others entered the picture and provided stiff competition for the family business.[6]
In 1950, George Berkowitz, the son of Harry, opened a fish market adjacent to his father's grocery store and named it Legal Sea Foods. This was done to add a degree of specialty to the grocery business by offering customers a fish counter where they could get fresh fish.[6] From the early 1950s the market sold fresh fish as well as fish and chips that could only be taken to-go. In 1968, the Berkowitz family decided to open a restaurant in the adjacent space. They served mainly fish and chips, fried clams, fried shrimp, and fried scallops served on paper plates while the customers sat on picnic tables.[6]
In 1975, the restaurant expanded to a more traditional restaurant at the site of the former S.S. Pierce building in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.[7] In 1980, the original Inman Square restaurant was destroyed in a fire.[8] With the help of his two sons, Marc and Roger, they opened their flagship location in the Park Plaza Hotel in the Boston Theater District of downtown Boston.
1980s[edit]
At the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981, Legal Sea Foods clam chowder was chosen to represent the state of Massachusetts and has been served at every presidential inauguration since.[9] Also in 1981, the restaurant established one of the first quality control centers for fish processing and distribution.
In 1986, Legal Sea Foods was named "Best Seafood Restaurant in America" by NBC's Today Show.[10]
1990s[edit]
In 1990, the restaurant partnered with the United States Department of Commerce in developing a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) program and establishing a landmark fishing industry standard for freshness and food safety.[11]
In 1992, Roger Berkowitz, the son of George, took over as CEO of the private restaurant business. Roger had worked in the family business since the age of ten, and is a graduate of the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.[12] During this time Roger became the company spokesman, and voiced many of the Legal Sea Foods radio commercials, including the award-winning "Fresh Insights" radio campaign.[13]
In March 1994, Food Arts Magazine awarded the Silver Spoon Award to George and Roger Berkowitz for sterling performance and raising Americans' consciousness about seafood for 30 years.[14] Legal also opened their first airport restaurant at Logan International Airport's Terminal C. Later in the year, the restaurant later opened a location in the Philadelphia International Airport. Also in 1994, the restaurant invited chefs from China to fuse Asian cuisine into the menu at the restaurants. This program was called "Cusineast" and some dishes created are still on the current menu.[15]
At the Super Bowl XXXI, hungry fans in New Orleans were treated to New England clam chowder from Legal's Chowda van.[16]
In 1998, Roger Berkowitz was invited to join the Harvard School of Public Health Nutrition Roundtable,[17] a group of people with personal and professional interests in nutrition.[18] It was during 1998, when Bon Appétit magazine named Legal Sea Food one of the Top Ten Tried and True restaurants in America.[19] Rich Vellante also becomes the restaurant group's Executive Chef in 1998 and is currently still in this position.[20]
In 1999, The International Food Manufacturers Association presented Roger Berkowitz with the Silver Plate award for the best full-service, multi-unit restaurant operator in America. This award is the food industry's highest honor.[21]
2000s[edit]
In 2000, the American Institute of Food and Wine sponsored Legal Sea Food's 50th birthday with celebrity chefs, including Julia Child, in attendance.[8] The CBS news program, Eye on America, focused on Legal Sea Food restaurant's quality control program with a segment on food safety.
In 2003, Legal Sea Food restaurants became one of America's first restaurants to go trans-fat free.[22] The New Legal Sea Foods Cookbook was published that year.[23]

In 2005, a new type of restaurant, Legal Test Kitchen (LTK), opened with a menu that is 50 to 60 percent non-seafood and with lower prices than at their more traditional locations.[24] Also in 2005, Legal began to offer gluten-free options on the menu for the first time, giving patrons with celiac disease more dining options.
In 2006, the free-standing Legal Test Kitchen (LTK) opened in the newly developed South Boston Waterfront District in Boston and offers multicultural dining options.[25][26] In 2006, Legal became one of the first restaurants in the United States to allow diners to pay their bill using a table-side device to self-pay.[26]

In 2013, Legal Sea Foods announced they would be opening a restaurant in the Downtown Crossing section Boston and the name would be Legal Crossing (LX).
On February 22, 2014, a carbon monoxide leak killed the manager of the Legal Sea Foods at the Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, New York and sickened 27 others. The leak was reportedly caused by a faulty flue pipe attached to a gas water heater. President & CEO of Legal Sea Foods, Roger Berkowitz, said that the company would install carbon monoxide detectors and conduct comprehensive safety audits at all locations. He also pledged to be at the forefront of legislative efforts to require the use of carbon monoxide detectors in commercial buildings.[31][32]
In the fall of 2016, the Peabody, Massachusetts location at the Northshore Mall underwent a complete remodeling.[33]
In April 2017, Legal Fish Bowl debuted in Kendall Square. It’s a fast-casual concept that features six signature bowls as well as the option to make your own.[34]

Menu[edit]
The menus vary by location, season and concept, but they all include a wide variety of specialty seafood entrees, appetizers, salads, and desserts. Over 40 varieties of fresh fish and shellfish, simply prepared according to New England tradition, are featured throughout the year. Most popular items include: lobster, clam chowder, fried clams, crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, tuna burgers, baked scrod, surf and turf and grilled fish fillets. Extensive wine lists and full-service bars are also available at all locations and have garnered recognition for its philosophy of offering value at all price points. The restaurant offers separate lunch and dinner menus as well as gluten-free menu options and award-winning kids’ menu.
By buying directly from day boat fishing operations, the company markets itself as having the freshest fish. The company also made industry advances on fish handling and has worked with the federal agencies on developing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP).[36]
In the media[edit]
Bon Appétit magazine touts a meal at Legal Sea Foods as among America's "Top Ten Tried-and-True" dining experiences.[19] Legal is also included in Patricia Schultz's popular guidebook, "1,000 Places to See Before You Die."[37] During 2008 it ran a series of humorous radio advertisements, created by its advertising agency DeVito/Verdi, capping with its aforementioned motto as well as a 'really fresh fish' ad campaign on Boston's trolleys that won industry awards.[38]

The Boston, Massachusetts Legal Sea Foods restaurant sponsored a January 2011 dinner that featured several species of fish which were listed by the advocacy organization Seafood Watch as ones to avoid for sustainability reasons.[39] Legal Sea Foods CEO, Roger Berkowitz said in a statement that much of the science around sustainable fisheries was "flawed" and "outdated."[40] While the protest was criticized by several environmental organizations, it was praised by others, including some in the media. Representatives of fishermen in Gloucester supported the choice to use locally sourced fish.[41]

Advertising and marketing[edit]
In the late summer of 2014, Legal began running print and television spots, in six states and the District of Columbia, that argue that its seafood restaurants should never be called a chain. The series of advertisements, created by the New York advertising firm DeVito/Verdi, uses the restaurant's chief executive, Roger Berkowitz to explain why his seafood restaurants should not be called a chain.[1]
In March 2015, Legal partnered with the ride-sharing company Uber on a promotion to deliver bowls of clam chowder anywhere in the city of Boston. The chowder cost $10 with $1 being donated to the Greater Boston Food Bank.[58]
In 2015, Legal once again teamed up with DeVito/Verdi to launch a multimedia advertising campaign that attempts to establish a new religion whose members will be known as "pescatarians," comparing them to Catholics and Presbyterians. CEO Berkowitz said that the campaign was the widest-reaching to date and spanned all forms of media from print, online, television, and even a gag website.[59] The humorous campaign did face some minor backlash from religious people who were offended by comparing the restaurant to Jesus and Moses.[60]
During the presidential primary of 2016, Legal launched a campaign themed parody produced by DeVito/Verdi. On Super Tuesday, Roger Berkowitz declared himself a candidate for President of the United States in a parody ad campaign of the "fishy" election. Among other things, he promised that on his first day in office he'd legalize seaweed, and he urged voters to #feeltheberk on social media.[61] The spots aired in newspapers, news radio and in print.[62]

History[edit]
In 1904, Harry Berkowitz opened the "Legal Cash Market" in the Inman Square neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts and the name for the market came from the "Legal Stamps", also known as trading stamps, given to loyal customers. The store provided a good living for Harry and his family up until the late 1940s, when chain grocery stores like Stop & Shop and others entered the picture and provided stiff competition for the family business.[6]
In 1950, George Berkowitz, the son of Harry, opened a fish market adjacent to his father's grocery store and named it Legal Sea Foods. This was done to add a degree of specialty to the grocery business by offering customers a fish counter where they could get fresh fish.[6] From the early 1950s the market sold fresh fish as well as fish and chips that could only be taken to-go. In 1968, the Berkowitz family decided to open a restaurant in the adjacent space. They served mainly fish and chips, fried clams, fried shrimp, and fried scallops served on paper plates while the customers sat on picnic tables.[6]
In 1975, the restaurant expanded to a more traditional restaurant at the site of the former S.S. Pierce building in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.[7] In 1980, the original Inman Square restaurant was destroyed in a fire.[8] With the help of his two sons, Marc and Roger, they opened their flagship location in the Park Plaza Hotel in the Boston Theater District of downtown Boston.
1980s[edit]
At the first inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 1981, Legal Sea Foods clam chowder was chosen to represent the state of Massachusetts and has been served at every presidential inauguration since.[9] Also in 1981, the restaurant established one of the first quality control centers for fish processing and distribution.
In 1986, Legal Sea Foods was named "Best Seafood Restaurant in America" by NBC's Today Show.[10]
1990s[edit]
In 1990, the restaurant partnered with the United States Department of Commerce in developing a hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) program and establishing a landmark fishing industry standard for freshness and food safety.[11]
In 1992, Roger Berkowitz, the son of George, took over as CEO of the private restaurant business. Roger had worked in the family business since the age of ten, and is a graduate of the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University.[12] During this time Roger became the company spokesman, and voiced many of the Legal Sea Foods radio commercials, including the award-winning "Fresh Insights" radio campaign.[13]
In March 1994, Food Arts Magazine awarded the Silver Spoon Award to George and Roger Berkowitz for sterling performance and raising Americans' consciousness about seafood for 30 years.[14] Legal also opened their first airport restaurant at Logan International Airport's Terminal C. Later in the year, the restaurant later opened a location in the Philadelphia International Airport. Also in 1994, the restaurant invited chefs from China to fuse Asian cuisine into the menu at the restaurants. This program was called "Cusineast" and some dishes created are still on the current menu.[15]

In 2005, a new type of restaurant, Legal Test Kitchen (LTK), opened with a menu that is 50 to 60 percent non-seafood and with lower prices than at their more traditional locations.[24] Also in 2005, Legal began to offer gluten-free options on the menu for the first time, giving patrons with celiac disease more dining options.
In 2006, the free-standing Legal Test Kitchen (LTK) opened in the newly developed South Boston Waterfront District in Boston and offers multicultural dining options.[25][26] In 2006, Legal became one of the first restaurants in the United States to allow diners to pay their bill using a table-side device to self-pay.[26]

In 2010, Legal Sea Food celebrated sixty years in business,the restaurants offering clam chowder for 60 cents a cup.
In 2011, Legal opened their new flagship restaurant, Legal Harborside on the Boston waterfront[29] and it was soon named "Best New Restaurant" by Esquire magazine. The Harborside location has a trout fishing pond in the restaurant's main lobby where children can catch and release fish from a licensed indoor fishing pond.[30]
In 2013, Legal Sea Foods announced they would be opening a restaurant in the Downtown Crossing section Boston and the name would be Legal Crossing (LX).
On February 22, 2014, a carbon monoxide leak killed the manager of the Legal Sea Foods at the Walt Whitman Shops in Huntington Station, New York and sickened 27 others. The leak was reportedly caused by a faulty flue pipe attached to a gas water heater. President & CEO of Legal Sea Foods, Roger Berkowitz, said that the company would install carbon monoxide detectors and conduct comprehensive safety audits at all locations. He also pledged to be at the forefront of legislative efforts to require the use of carbon monoxide detectors in commercial buildings.[31][32]
In the fall of 2016, the Peabody, Massachusetts location at the Northshore Mall underwent a complete remodeling.[33]
In April 2017, Legal Fish Bowl debuted in Kendall Square. It’s a fast-casual concept that features six signature bowls as well as the option to make your own.[34]
Legal announced they would be opening a Legal C Bar location in the Garden City section of Cranston, Rhode Island in the winter of 2018/2019. The restaurant will be the anchor of a new 30,000-square-foot building that is part of Garden City Center.[35]
Menu[edit]
The menus vary by location, season and concept, but they all include a wide variety of specialty seafood entrees, appetizers, salads, and desserts. Over 40 varieties of fresh fish and shellfish, simply prepared according to New England tradition, are featured throughout the year. Most popular items include: lobster, clam chowder, fried clams, crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, tuna burgers, baked scrod, surf and turf and grilled fish fillets. Extensive wine lists and full-service bars are also available at all locations and have garnered recognition for its philosophy of offering value at all price points. The restaurant offers separate lunch and dinner menus as well as gluten-free menu options and award-winning kids’ menu.
By buying directly from day boat fishing operations, the company markets itself as having the freshest fish. The company also made industry advances on fish handling and has worked with the federal agencies on developing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP).[36]
In the media[edit]
Bon Appétit magazine touts a meal at Legal Sea Foods as among America's "Top Ten Tried-and-True" dining experiences.[19] Legal is also included in Patricia Schultz's popular guidebook, "1,000 Places to See Before You Die."[37] During 2008 it ran a series of humorous radio advertisements, created by its advertising agency DeVito/Verdi, capping with its aforementioned motto as well as a 'really fresh fish' ad campaign on Boston's trolleys that won industry awards.[38]

The Boston, Massachusetts Legal Sea Foods restaurant sponsored a January 2011 dinner that featured several species of fish which were listed by the advocacy organization Seafood Watch as ones to avoid for sustainability reasons.[39] Legal Sea Foods CEO, Roger Berkowitz said in a statement that much of the science around sustainable fisheries was "flawed" and "outdated."[40] While the protest was criticized by several environmental organizations, it was praised by others, including some in the media. Representatives of fishermen in Gloucester supported the choice to use locally sourced fish.[41]

Advertising and marketing[edit]
In the late summer of 2014, Legal began running print and television spots, in six states and the District of Columbia, that argue that its seafood restaurants should never be called a chain. The series of advertisements, created by the New York advertising firm DeVito/Verdi, uses the restaurant's chief executive, Roger Berkowitz to explain why his seafood restaurants should not be called a chain.[1]
In March 2015, Legal partnered with the ride-sharing company Uber on a promotion to deliver bowls of clam chowder anywhere in the city of Boston. The chowder cost $10 with $1 being donated to the Greater Boston Food Bank.[58]
In 2015, Legal once again teamed up with DeVito/Verdi to launch a multimedia advertising campaign that attempts to establish a new religion whose members will be known as "pescatarians," comparing them to Catholics and Presbyterians. CEO Berkowitz said that the campaign was the widest-reaching to date and spanned all forms of media from print, online, television, and even a gag website.[59] The humorous campaign did face some minor backlash from religious people who were offended by comparing the restaurant to Jesus and Moses.[60]
During the presidential primary of 2016, Legal launched a campaign themed parody produced by DeVito/Verdi. On Super Tuesday, Roger Berkowitz declared himself a candidate for President of the United States in a parody ad campaign of the "fishy" election. Among other things, he promised that on his first day in office he'd legalize seaweed, and he urged voters to #feeltheberk on social media.[61] The spots aired in newspapers, news radio and in print.[62]

He has extensive experience in venture capital financing, public offerings, mergers and acquisitions and technology transactions. Before joining WSGR, Mr. George was an Associate Attorney with Buist Moore Smythe & McGee in Charleston, S.C. Mr. George worked at KPMG Peat Marwick in Washington, D.C., before attending law school. He is a certified pubic accountant.

Our new water heaters are great for delivering plenty of hot water on set. They have an 85 gallon capacity and heat up in approximately 30 minutes—making it easy to deliver plenty of hot water quickly. They're electric powered (220v single phase @ 20 amps) so they're very quiet. And they're designed so the heating element will not operate unless the tank is full—to prevent damage to the equipment.

George will succeed Steven Muck, who has elected to retire after a 41-year career with Exterran and its predecessor companies.Roger George has a track record of driving growth, innovation and increasing profitability. He has held leadership positions in the oil and gas and power generation sectors for GE, where most recently he was Product Line Leader of their 50Hz utility gas turbine business in Atlanta. Prior to that he was General Manager of GE’s Global Sales and Commercial Operations for distributed power. His other positions with GE include head of Global Compression Sales (distributed power) and General Manager of GE Jenbacher Gas Engines for North America. Earlier in his career he worked for Optimal CAE, Inc. and the Ford Motor Company. George holds an MBA from the University of Chicago and a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla.Andrew J. Way, Exterran’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: “Roger brings a wealth of business and technical experience to Exterran. His deep technical knowledge and results-driven approach will be great assets as we invest and strengthen our portfolio offering, sharpen our strategy and grow our global business.”Way added, “Steve Muck has played many key roles in the Exterran story and has been a great partner to me since I joined the Company. We will surely miss his presence and strong guiding influence. We wish Steve the very best in his well-deserved retirement.”George said, “I’m impressed by the high caliber talent Exterran has been attracting and am eager to join the team. The Company’s global footprint, well-known brand, and its reputation as a technical leader create a strong platform and potential for growth. I look forward to helping the Company fulfill its potential.”About Exterran CorporationExterran Corporation (EXTN) is a market leader in compression, production and processing products and services, serving customers throughout the world engaged in all aspects of the oil and natural gas industry. Its global product lines include natural gas compression, process & treating and production equipment and water treatment solutions.

Exterran Corporation is headquartered in Houston, Texas and operates in approximately 30 countries.For more information, visit www.exterran.com.Forward-Looking StatementsAll statements in this release (and oral statements made regarding the subjects of this release) other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are outside Exterran’s control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to, the anticipated timing for regaining compliance with all SEC filing requirements and NYSE listing requirements.While Exterran believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in predicting certain important factors that could impact the future performance or results of its business. Among the factors that could cause results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are the following: local, regional, national and international economic conditions and the impact they may have on Exterran and its customers; Exterran’s reduced profit margins or loss of market share resulting from competition or the introduction of competing technologies by other companies; Exterran Corporation’s reliance on Archrock and Archrock Partners, L.P. (named Exterran Partners, L.P. prior to November 3, 2015) for a significant amount of its product sales revenues and its ability to secure new product sales customers; conditions in the oil and gas industry, including a sustained decrease in the level of supply or demand for oil or natural gas or a sustained decrease in the price of oil or natural gas; Exterran’s ability to timely and cost-effectively execute larger projects; changes in political or economic conditions in key operating markets, including international markets; changes in current exchange rates, including the risk of currency devaluations by foreign governments, and restrictions on currency repatriation; the inherent risks associated with Exterran’s operations, such as equipment defects, malfunctions and natural disasters; any non-performance by third parties of their contractual obligations; and changes in safety, health, environmental and other regulations; unanticipated delays in completing the Audit Committee’s internal investigation, the preparation and audit of the Company’s previously filed financial statements and the implementation of changes to the Company’s internal controls and procedures.Read MoreThese forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in Exterran’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, Exterran’s Registration Statement on Form 10 and Exterran’s other filings with the SEC, which are available at www.exterran.com. Except as required by law, Exterran expressly disclaims any intention or obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161208006292/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextSurprise!
