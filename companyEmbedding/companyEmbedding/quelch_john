Building A Culture of Health
A New Imperative for Business
This ambitious volume sets out to understand how every company impacts public health and introduces a robust model, rooted in organizational and scientific knowledge, for companies committed to making positive contributions to health and wellness. Focusing on four interconnected areas of corporate impact, it not only discusses the business imperative of promoting a healthier society and improved living conditions worldwide, but also provides guidelines for measuring a company’s population health footprint. Examples, statistics and visuals showcase emerging corporate involvement in public health and underscore the business opportunities available to companies that invest in health. The authors offer a detailed roadmap for optimizing health-promoting actions in a rapidly evolving business and social climate across these core areas: 

Planning and building a culture of health
Consumer health: How organizations affect the safety, integrity, and healthfulness of the products and services they offer to their customers and end consumers
Employee health: How organizations affect the health of their employees (e.g., provision of employer-sponsored health insurance, workplace practices and wellness programs)
Community health: How organizations affect the health of the communities in which they operate and do business
Environmental Health: How organizations' environmental policies (or lack thereof) affect individual and population health
Implementing and sustaining a culture of health           

 Building a Culture of Health clarifies both a mission and a vision for use by MPH and MBA students in health management, professors in schools of public health and business schools, and business leaders and chief medical officers in health care and non-health care businesses.       



















Consumers, Corporations and Public Health (Oxford University Press, 2016) 
A Case-Based Approach to Sustainable Business
The public health footprint associated with corporate behavior has come under increased scrutiny in the last decade, with an increased expectation that private profit not come at the expense of consumer welfare.Consumers, Corporations, and Public Health assembles 17 case studies at the intersection of business and public health to illustrate how each side can inform and benefit the other. Through contemporary examples from a variety of industries and geographies, this collection provides students with an appreciation for the importance of consumer empowerment and consumer behavior in shaping both health and corporate outcomes.




AbstractTable of Contents














All Business is Local
Why Place Matters More Than Ever in a Global, Virtual World
Today's business leaders are so obsessed with all things global and virtual that they risk neglecting the critical impact of physical place. It's a paradox of the Internet age: now that it's possible for businesses to be everywhere at once, they need to focus on what it means to be one specific place at a time.
The best global brands, from IBM to McDonald's, are by design also the leading local brands. For instance, your decision to patronize Starbucks will depend on whether it's the best local coffee shop in your neighborhood, not on how many thousands of global locations it has.
Marketing experts John Quelch and Katherine Jocz offer a new way to think about place in every strategic decision-from how to leverage consumer associations with locations to where to position products on the shelf. They explore case studies such as Nike and The Apple Store, which use place in creative ways.



















Greater Good
How Good Marketing Makes for Better Democracy
Marketing has a greater purpose, and marketers, a higher calling, than simply selling more widgets, according to John Quelch and Katherine Jocz. In Greater Good, the authors contend that marketing performs an essential societal function--and does so democratically. They maintain that people would benefit if the realms of politics and marketing were informed by one another's best principles and practices. Quelch and Jocz lay out the six fundamental characteristics that marketing and democracy share: (1) exchange of value, such as goods, services, and promises, (2) consumption of goods and services, (3) choice in all decisions, (4) free flow of information, (5) active engagement of a majority of individuals, and (6) inclusion of as many people as possible. Without these six traits, both marketing and democracy would fail, and with them, society. Drawing on current and historical examples from economies around the world, this landmark work illuminates marketing's critical role in the development, growth, and governance of societies. It reveals how good marketing practices improve the political process and--in turn--the practice of democracy itself.

Early life and career[edit]
Quelch was born in London, son of an RAF officer and a nurse .[2] He began his education at a one-room schoolhouse in the Isle of Man, attended primary school in Australia, then returned to England, settling in Norwich and enrolling in Town Close School[2] and later Norwich School.[1] Quelch received his BA and MA from Exeter College, Oxford University, where he was an Open Scholar in Modern History. At Oxford, he edited the student newspaper Cherwell.[2] As a Thouron Scholar, he earned an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He then took an SM from the Harvard School of Public Health and a DBA from Harvard Business School.
Quelch's first academic post was as a visiting instructor at the University of Hawaii. He was next appointed assistant professor at the School of Business Administration (now the Ivey School) of the University of Western Ontario. In 1979, he returned to Harvard Business School as an assistant professor. He became a tenured professor in 1988 and was appointed the Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing and Co-Chair of the Marketing department in 1994.
In 1998, he was appointed Dean (with Vice-Chancellor status) of London Business School. During his tenure, revenues and student enrollments increased 50% over three years,[3] and faculty numbers increased 30%. A network of twenty-five alumni clubs and six international advisory boards was established, corporate sponsorships doubled, and the yield on MBA admissions rose from 57% to 73%. In 2001, London Business School received the Queen's Award for Enterprise and was ranked number eight business school in the world by the Financial Times.[4]
Quelch returned to Harvard in 2001 as Lincoln Filene Professor of Business Administration and Senior Associate Dean for International Development overseeing the establishment of a global network of research centers.[5] Between 2006 and 2008, he served as Senior Associate Dean responsible for coordinating the planning and execution of Harvard Business School's 2008 Centennial celebrations. He also served as a director of the Harvard Business School Publishing Company.
In 2009, Quelch was on sabbatical leave in Shanghai as the La Caixa Visiting Professor of International Management and Chairman of the Academic Advisory Council at the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS). Between 2011 and 2013, Professor Quelch served as Dean, Vice-President and Distinguished Professor of International Management at the CEIBS.[6] During his tenure, CEIBS' MBA global ranking in the Financial Times improved from 24 to 15 and the Executive MBA from 18 to 7. The number of full-time faculty and CEIBS revenues both increased by one-third. Special emphasis was placed on upgrading CEIBS research output, executive education, global awareness and fundraising.[7]
Quelch returned to Harvard in 2013 as the first Harvard Business School professor to hold a joint primary appointment at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health as professor of Health Policy and Management. Between 2013 and 2017, he also served as an associate in research at Harvard's Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, fellow of the Harvard China Fund, and member of the Harvard China Advisory Board.
Research and publications[edit]
Quelch's early research focused on the application of marketing to preventive healthcare programs.This resulted in the article "Marketing Principles and the Future of Preventive Health Care" (Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly/Health and Society, 1980) and other papers in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and Nutrition Reviews.
Next, Quelch focused on how to improve the design and productivity of temporary price promotions. This work coalesced in the book, Sales Promotion Management, (Prentice-Hall, 1989).
By the late 1980s, Quelch had already turned his attention to the marketing implications of globalization. His research on global marketing was profiled by Mazur and Miles in Conversations With Marketing Masters (John Wiley, 2007). His books in this domain include:

The Global Market (Jossey Bass, 2005) and
The New Global Brands: Managing Non-Governmental Organizations in the 21st Century (Thomson, 2006)

Since 2013, Quelch has focused his attention on patient centricity and consumer empowerment in the healthcare sector. Consumers, Corporations and Public Health, (Oxford University Press, 2016) was followed by Building A Culture of Health: A New Imperative for Business (Springer, 2016).
Quelch's practitioner focused articles embrace eighteen contributions in the Harvard Business Review.

"Can Corporate Social Responsibility Survive The Recession?" (Leader to Leader, 2009) and "Government Adoption of Sales Promotions: An Initial Appraisal" (Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 2010).
Professor Quelch is known for his teaching materials and innovations in pedagogy. His case studies have sold over 4 million copies, third highest in HBS history. In 1995, he developed the first HBS interactive CD-ROM exercise (on Intel's advertising budgeting process). In 1999, he developed and presented a series of twelve one-hour programs on Marketing Management for the Public Broadcasting System. His Marketing Know:How blog, accessible at [1] and published by Harvard Business School Publishing, has been translated into Chinese and Vietnamese.
Other activities[edit]
In 2002, Acting Governor Jane Swift of Massachusetts appointed Quelch to be chairman of the board of the Massachusetts Port Authority, overseeing three airports, waterfront real estate and the seaport of Boston. In this pro bono role, he chaired the security and safety committee and, later, the strategy and services committee of the Massport board.

In an additional pro bono role, Quelch has served from 2003 as Honorary Consul General of the Kingdom of Morocco for the New England region. His long-standing ties to the Middle East resulted in the book, Business Strategies For Muslim Countries (Prentice Hall, 2000).
Quelch has governance experience as a non-executive director of public companies in the United States and the United Kingdom. In 2013, he stepped down as a non-executive director of WPP plc, the world's largest marketing and media services company, after 25 years of service.

He served previously as a director of easyJet plc, Pentland Group plc, Pepsi Bottling Group and Reebok International Ltd. He is senior strategy advisor to JD.com, the Chinese e-commerce company.
In the not-for-profit sector, Quelch has served as honorary chairman of the British American Business Council of New England, as a trustee of the London-based STARS foundation and as a board member of Americans for Oxford, Accion International and the National Council of Better Business Bureaus.

Quelch was born in London, son of an RAF officer and a nurse .[2] He began his education at a one-room schoolhouse in the Isle of Man, attended primary school in Australia, then returned to England, settling in Norwich and enrolling in Town Close School[2] and later Norwich School.[1] Quelch received his BA and MA from Exeter College, Oxford University, where he was an Open Scholar in Modern History. At Oxford, he edited the student newspaper Cherwell.[2] As a Thouron Scholar, he earned an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He then took an SM from the Harvard School of Public Health and a DBA from Harvard Business School.
Quelch's first academic post was as a visiting instructor at the University of Hawaii. He was next appointed assistant professor at the School of Business Administration (now the Ivey School) of the University of Western Ontario. In 1979, he returned to Harvard Business School as an assistant professor. He became a tenured professor in 1988 and was appointed the Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing and Co-Chair of the Marketing department in 1994.
In 1998, he was appointed Dean (with Vice-Chancellor status) of London Business School. During his tenure, revenues and student enrollments increased 50% over three years,[3] and faculty numbers increased 30%. A network of twenty-five alumni clubs and six international advisory boards was established, corporate sponsorships doubled, and the yield on MBA admissions rose from 57% to 73%. In 2001, London Business School received the Queen's Award for Enterprise and was ranked number eight business school in the world by the Financial Times.[4]
Quelch returned to Harvard in 2001 as Lincoln Filene Professor of Business Administration and Senior Associate Dean for International Development overseeing the establishment of a global network of research centers.[5] Between 2006 and 2008, he served as Senior Associate Dean responsible for coordinating the planning and execution of Harvard Business School's 2008 Centennial celebrations.

Op-Ed: Can the Proposed American Health Care Act Improve on ‘Obamacare’?

Politics aside, the primary question to be asked about the newly proposed American Health Care Act is this: Will it improve choice, cost, and outcomes for health care consumers?
by John Quelch, Dr. Gordon Moore, and Emily Boudreau


Yesterday, President Donald Trump endorsed the American Health Care Act (AHCA), a plan proposed by Republican United States lawmakers to replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), more commonly known as “Obamacare.” Democrats rallied against the new plan, arguing that it was likely to reduce access to coverage and increase premiums. However, the new proposal actually looks far more similar to Obamacare than many anticipated–causing some conservative groups to speak out forcefully against it. Criticizing the plan, Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky even called it “Obamacare Lite.”
Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas and the House Ways and Means chairman, stated “our legislation transfers power from Washington back to the American people. We dismantle Obamacare’s damaging taxes and mandates so states can deliver quality, affordable options based on what their patient populations need, and workers and families can have the freedom and flexibility to make their own health care choices.”
This statement speaks to a strong attachment to personal freedom and choice in American society—particularly within the Republican Party. Not everyone agrees that freedom of individual choice should always trump government intervention but, perhaps more so than in other developed countries, this sentiment enjoys widespread support in America. The government should not be able to mandate that I buy health insurance or impose a financial penalty if I do not; an employer should not be able to require that I have an annual checkup. Individual consumers should have the right to decide whether they need these services.
It is wrong to contend that fostering consumer choice in health care is entirely a far-right idea. Proposals from both the left and the right have created larger roles for consumers in the health care marketplace. Obamacare opened up a mass market of coverage sold directly to individuals. This was arguably the largest driver of a consumer revolution in health insurance. It expanded options for those with pre-existing conditions, who often had little choice before, and markedly reduced the uninsured rate. However, consumers in some states found that their new plans had narrower networks and their physicians weren’t always included. In 2016, some of the largest insurers pulled out of the state marketplaces after sustaining substantial financial losses. Consumers had fewer options to choose from and many of the remaining plans raised their premiums.
Therefore, politics aside, the question everyone should be asking is: Will this new plan improve choice, cost, and outcomes for health care consumers?
The AHCA maintains several popular provisions included under Obamacare; it prohibits health insurers from denying coverage to patients with pre-existing conditions, or charging them more money, and allows children to remain on their parents’ health plans until age 26. Maintaining these consumer protections is a boon for many people and their families.
The AHCA’s most significant departure from Obamacare is the elimination of the individual mandate, which required individuals to sign up for health insurance or face a penalty. Consumers will now have a choice: should I purchase health insurance or not? For those consumers who value individual freedom, having the ability to answer this question will be seen as a benefit. However, if too many people do indeed opt out of purchasing plans, the potential downside is that, collectively, costs may rise. Risk pools of older and sicker individuals will undoubtedly raise premiums. To incentivize people to sign up for plans, the AHCA proposes age-based tax credits for low- to middle-income individuals instead of a mandate, with older Americans receiving larger credits.
Under Obamacare, older enrollees who hadn’t yet reached Medicare-eligibility (those in the 50s and 60s) benefited because health insurers could only charge them three times more than younger enrollees. The AHCA proposes that this could increase to five times. Therefore, younger and healthier individuals may see their costs go down, while older people will face a larger cost burden.
Wealthier Americans also stand to benefit, largely due to the legislation’s proposed tax cuts. In addition, the plan also advocates for expanded use of Health Savings Accounts, tax-advantaged savings accounts for medical expenses, which are currently only offered to individuals with high-deductible health plans. While these accounts do allow for consumers to better plan for future medical expenses, there is justified concern that these accounts would be more likely to benefit the wealthy and educated, who have more income to put away.
Many of the plan’s most significant changes deal with Medicaid. Obamacare expanded Medicaid coverage for nearly all low-income individuals with incomes at or below 138 percent of the poverty line, and almost half of the previously uninsured individuals who gained coverage under Obamacare received it through Medicaid expansion. The AHCA would end enhanced federal Medicaid funding for new enrollees starting in 2020. States would receive a set amount of funding per enrollee each year, letting them administer Medicaid as each sees fit. However, states without the money to fund the difference would likely reduce eligibility or benefits.
Summary
In conclusion, it seems likely that some consumers, particularly younger and healthier ones, may see their level of choice and therefore competitive pricing improve under the AHCA, while older, sicker, and lower income consumers may find their options reduced.
Finally, the bill was released without a score from Congressional Budget Office, leaving the total cost of the proposal, as well as its projected effects on coverage, unknown. Suffice it to say that given the unknown costs and heated politics—both between the two parties and among factions of Republicans—the debate is far from over. Significant changes are likely before it passes in Congress.

Creating A Culture of Health

All American companies are in the health business whether they like it or not. The private sector directly pays for one-fifth of the whopping 17.5% of GDP spent on healthcare in the United States. Rather than viewing health merely as an insurance expense to be controlled, every company needs to embrace building a culture of health as a business opportunity.
Forward thinking companies are doing just that. After CVS removed tobacco products from store shelves and renamed itself CVS Health, new revenues more than made up for lost sales. Johnson and Johnson has achieved a $4 return for every dollar invested in employee health and wellness programs over 30 years. Bath Iron Works in Maine has extended a successful in-house diabetes prevention initiative into the wider community. It expects to cut participants’ future healthcare costs over 5 years by 60% on average.
Recognizing both necessity and opportunity, companies are scrambling to assess and improve the health impact of their business strategies and operations. Last month 150 top executives from diverse industries met for two days at Harvard Business School to hammer out an agenda for building a culture of health in American businesses across four domains: Employee Health, which companies invest in to improve the wellness of current and future employees; Environmental Health, which connects companies’ environmental policies to the health of populations affected by their operations; Community Health, in which businesses boost the health of the local communities in which they operate; Consumer Health, which targets the healthfulness and safety of a company’s products and services for its consumers. “This was not charitable work,” the vice chairman of a large food and beverage company told peers about reducing sugar, salt, and saturated fat in its product portfolio, “It makes business sense.”
The business imperative for companies springs from past neglect and the traditional healthcare system’s ongoing inability to solve America’s health conundrum: poorer health outcomes than in other wealthy countries despite much higher spending on healthcare. How is it possible that American children and adolescents—the future of the U.S. workforce—rank last in health outcomes against wealthy country peers? Not only does this represent a lousy return on investment nationally, it has consequences for American business, including flagging worker productivity and weaker consumer demand for other products and services as consumers spend more on healthcare.
Relying solely on medical care to fix America’s health problem, is futile. Medical treatments influence total health outcomes far less than prevention—defined not just as better diet and exercise, but also in terms of good education, good jobs, good housing, etc. The Affordable Care Act starts to address this complex challenge, but government, non-governmental organizations, and the healthcare industry simply do not have sufficient capabilities or resources to develop and execute innovative solutions on their own. That’s where forward thinking businesses are stepping in to implement health initiatives independently or through partnerships. Continue reading
 

 


The Marketing of Prevention

The US will devote 17.5% of GDP to health care this year, around $3 trillion. Yet only 3 percent of that will be spent on prevention, including both primary prevention (preventing illness in the first place) and secondary prevention (preventing sick people getting sicker or having a relapse). Medicine saves lives, doctors are heroes and the best earn Nobel prizes. Prevention, by contrast, is mundane, measurement of effectiveness is difficult, rewards and recognition pale by comparison.
 
In a recent NEJM paper, Tom Farley, Philadelphia Health Commissioner, bemoaned the underfunding of proven prevention programs while sick people certain to die nevertheless continue to receive expensive treatments. Why does a utilitarian greatest good for the greatest number perspective not prevail? Farley cites two reasons: when a life is at stake, it’s unethical to withhold treatment, regardless of cost effectiveness; second, medical treatments are funded by payers and providers whereas prevention programs are typically funded from public health budgets subject to annual budget cuts by short-sighted politicians.
 
There is another important reason. Diet, exercise and other lifestyle decisions are viewed by many as matters of personal choice, even though society may later have to pick up the health care costs associated with these decisions.  Prevention involves taking personal responsibility for one’s health. The worried well do so, wearing Fitbits or following diets, the chronically ill often do not.
 
Why do people not respond to good advice regarding diet and exercise? Continue reading

                           Why businesses should never underestimate the power of place. Today's business leaders are so obsessed with all things global
                              and virtual that they risk neglecting the critical impact of physical place. It's a paradox of the Internet age: now that
                              it's possible for businesses to be everywhere at once, they need to focus on what it means to be one specific place at a time

                              executives today. But many companies who have developed a presence in the global market now face the challenges inherent in
                              creating a multinational presence with the demands of the "unglobal consumer" who does not have a "one size fits all" need.

                           "Because marketing is move democratic than politics. In Greater Good, John A. Quelch and Katherine E. Jocz argue that democracy,
                              like a marketplace, should be driven by a healthy dialogue that benefits all parties." "When governments treat citizens more
                              like consumers - studying their needs, encouraging their feedback, and developing long-term relationships - then democracy
                              becomes more democratic. Managers and marketers, in turn, can learn from democracy's focus on fairness and concern for the
                              greater good." "In a sweeping portrait of business, government, and society, the authors challenge the belief that modern
                              marketing somehow contaminates the political process. In fact, democracy and marketing share six fundamental characteristics:
                              value is exchanged; goods and services are consumed; decisions involve free choice; information must flow freely; a majority
                              of the population actively engages in the process; and they seek to involve as many people as possible." "Isn't it dangerous
                              to treat a politician or social program like a product or a service? In fact, the authors cite compelling examples to show
                              how marketers from Coca-Cola to eBay succeed by supplying not products, but solutions - not functions, but benefits."--Jacket

Product Description

John Quelch (1666-June 30, 1704) was an English pirate who had a lucrative but very brief career of about one year. His chief claim to historical significance is that he was the first person to be tried for piracy outside of England under Admiralty Law and thus without a jury. These Admiralty courts had been instituted to tackle the rise of piracy in colonial ports where civil and criminal courts had proved ineffective.

Clean Edge Razor: Splitting Hairs in Product Positioning
by 
							John A. Quelch and Heather Beckham

Abstract
After three years of development, Paramount Health and Beauty Company is preparing to launch a new technologically advanced vibrating razor called Clean Edge. The innovative new design of Clean Edge provides superior performance by stimulating the hair follicles to lift the hair from the skin, allowing for a closer shave. The company has already decided to introduce Clean Edge into the men's market where it has a strong presence. Jackson Randall, the product manager for Clean Edge, struggles with how best to position the product for the launch. One strategy is to release Clean Edge as a "niche" product, targeting the high-end market of fastidious groomers looking for superior skin care products. Another strategy is to release the product into the highly competitive mainstream razor market where the product can be positioned as the most effective razor available. Randall meets internal resistance to the mainstream strategy from the product manager for the company's current, but aging, mainstream razor products and he must consider the effects of cannibalization in his plan. Randall must recommend an optimal strategy and provide supporting economic analysis of his decision--not just for Clean Edge, but for its effect on the entire company.

Magellan Boatworks
John A. Quelch and James T. Kindley
Magellan Boatworks is a midsize manufacturer of customized, power "cruising yachts." In the face of economic and political uncertainty in late 2016, Magellan's VP of sales and marketing, Walt Robinson, wonders whether he should request a budget increase for 2017. Important questions abound. Can Robinson's team increase sales even with a lower budget? Should the company reallocate its advertising and promotion budget? Should Robinson consider changing Magellan's marketing message and narrowing its target market? Why are Magellan's two best salespeople so significantly outperforming their colleagues? This case can be used in an introductory or executive course that covers integrated marketing communications (IMC), including sales. It is also suitable for elective courses in advertising strategy and sales force management. The case's focus on a luxury item that symbolizes success for many individuals should generate lively discussion.

When Your Product Becomes a Commodity
 

 Like death and taxes, commoditization of your products is a given. Marketing professor John Quelch offers tips for delaying the inevitable and dealing with it once it arrives. Key concepts include:
                        The speed from product launch to maturity is faster than ever before.
Innovate, bundle, and segment are 3 things marketers can do to delay commoditization.
Managers already in a commoditized market must rethink salesforce compensation and pricing, trim costs, acquire competitors, and fire unprofitable customers.
 
 
by John Quelch
Editor's Note: Harvard Business School professor John Quelch writes a blog on marketing issues, called Marketing Know: How, for Harvard Business Online. It is reprinted on HBS Working Knowledge.
How often have you heard a manager blame "commoditization" for failing to deliver sales or profits? If you've heard it, you've probably wondered if it was just a convenient excuse or if the manager had a valid point.
The truth is, even when a raw material has no value added and quality standards are set by law or the industry, there is still plenty of opportunity for differentiation around availability, delivery, shipment quantities, payment terms, and all the other services that accompany the core product. Marketers must use their imagination. As the saying goes: "There are no mature products, only mature managers."
That said, intense global competition, outsourcing, and offshoring are all squeezing margins, increasing customer price sensitivity, and making it harder to sustain inter-brand differentiation. The product life cycle suggests that, as product categories mature, they become more susceptible to the forces of commoditization. The difference today is that the speed from launch to maturity is faster than ever before.
Marketers can do three things to delay the inevitable forces of commoditization.
Innovate. A new product that better meets consumer needs, even an upgrade of an existing product, can one-up competitors and force them to invest in matching or exceeding the new specifications.
Bundle. Selling a commoditized product with differentiated ancillary services (such as after-sales service) can appeal to buyers willing to pay a premium for the convenience.
Segment. Mature markets are large markets that can be divided profitably into multiple segments. Marketers can focus on providing applications expertise for less price-sensitive customer segments for whom the product is still important.
However you approach commoditization, try to innovate at all costs.
The most overlooked investment a marketer can make in advance of inevitable commoditization is a customer relationship management system that permits computation of the profit margin associated with each customer, based on price-paid less cost-to-serve. Companies need to invest in these information systems early to have the information readily at hand once margins start being squeezed.
But how do you survive if you find yourself in a commoditizing industry characterized by me-too products, overcapacity, and frequent price cuts? How can you make money?
1. Decide which customers you do NOT want to serve, try renegotiating prices with them and, failing that, fire them. You will lose market share but improve profitability. 
2. Compensate your salesforce on profit margin, not sales revenues. A volume-based salesforce will sign up any customer, regardless of profitability. That's OK early in the product life cycle but not in maturity. 
3. Trim costs and acquire competitors (with profitable customers) to extract maximum scale economies in procurement, manufacturing, and distribution. 
4. If you aren't the low cost producer, complicate your pricing structures so customers can't easily make side-by-side comparisons, and provide discounts as needed of artificially inflated published prices.
Facing commoditization and non-existent product innovation, some companies retreat to serving a progressively smaller niche of price-insensitive, service-oriented customers. Others with favorable cost structures may aim to boost market share but then face the challenge of managing hybrid distribution, as some customers want to switch to buying through distributors (at lower prices) while other customers still seek direct sales support (but may not be willing to pay to cover the cost).
However you approach commoditization, try to innovate at all costs to beat it back. Because, as Peter Drucker said: "In a commodity market, you can only be as good as your dumbest competitor."

ShotSpotter: A Gunfire Detection Business Looks for a New Market

ShotSpotter provides gunfire detection sensors to cities across the United States. CEO Ralph Clark is interested in taking the company beyond its business-to-government sales model and into new markets. Could his company sell to schools and colleges? Could the technology be adapted for indoor applications like shopping malls and movie theaters? Could cities use it as an early alert to a terrorist attack? Professor Mitch Weiss discusses the difficulties moving from one business model to another,  and how successful companies make the transition.

At Oxford, he edited the student newspaper Cherwell.[2] As a Thouron Scholar, he earned an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He then took an SM from the Harvard School of Public Health and a DBA from Harvard Business School.
Quelch's first academic post was as a visiting instructor at the University of Hawaii. He was next appointed assistant professor at the School of Business Administration (now the Ivey School) of the University of Western Ontario. In 1979, he returned to Harvard Business School as an assistant professor. He became a tenured professor in 1988 and was appointed the Sebastian S. Kresge Professor of Marketing and Co-Chair of the Marketing department in 1994.
In 1998, he was appointed Dean (with Vice-Chancellor status) of London Business School. During his tenure, revenues and student enrollments increased 50% over three years,[3] and faculty numbers increased 30%. A network of twenty-five alumni clubs and six international advisory boards was established, corporate sponsorships doubled, and the yield on MBA admissions rose from 57% to 73%. In 2001, London Business School received the Queen's Award for Enterprise and was ranked number eight business school in the world by the Financial Times.[4]

The Global Market (Jossey Bass, 2005) and
The New Global Brands: Managing Non-Governmental Organizations in the 21st Century (Thomson, 2006)

"Can Corporate Social Responsibility Survive The Recession?" (Leader to Leader, 2009) and "Government Adoption of Sales Promotions: An Initial Appraisal" (Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 2010).
Professor Quelch is known for his teaching materials and innovations in pedagogy. His case studies have sold over 4 million copies, third highest in HBS history. In 1995, he developed the first HBS interactive CD-ROM exercise (on Intel's advertising budgeting process). In 1999, he developed and presented a series of twelve one-hour programs on Marketing Management for the Public Broadcasting System. His Marketing Know:How blog, accessible at [1] and published by Harvard Business School Publishing, has been translated into Chinese and Vietnamese.
Other activities[edit]
In 2002, Acting Governor Jane Swift of Massachusetts appointed Quelch to be chairman of the board of the Massachusetts Port Authority, overseeing three airports, waterfront real estate and the seaport of Boston. In this pro bono role, he chaired the security and safety committee and, later, the strategy and services committee of the Massport board.

"Can Corporate Social Responsibility Survive The Recession?" (Leader to Leader, 2009) and "Government Adoption of Sales Promotions: An Initial Appraisal" (Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, 2010).
Professor Quelch is known for his teaching materials and innovations in pedagogy. His case studies have sold over 4 million copies, third highest in HBS history. In 1995, he developed the first HBS interactive CD-ROM exercise (on Intel's advertising budgeting process). In 1999, he developed and presented a series of twelve one-hour programs on Marketing Management for the Public Broadcasting System. His Marketing Know:How blog, accessible at [1] and published by Harvard Business School Publishing, has been translated into Chinese and Vietnamese.

At Oxford, he edited the student newspaper Cherwell.[2] As a Thouron Scholar, he earned an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He then took an SM from the Harvard School of Public Health and a DBA from Harvard Business School.
Quelch's first academic post was as a visiting instructor at the University of Hawaii.

“China depth and global breadth”

Interview
Astrid Oldekop / 05-04-2011




China European International Business School (CEIBS) in the People’s Republic of China is the shooting star amongst Business Schools. Since February the school has a new dean with John A. Quelch, previously teaching in London and Harvard. Now it’s time to be in China, he says. MBA-Channel spoke to John Quelch about the impact of Asia on Business Schools and how he is going to turn CEIBS from a regional into a global brand.


John A. Quelch
After 30 years in the U.S. at Harvard Business School amongst others as senior associate dean and four years in Europe as dean at London Business School, why did you choose to come to the People’s Republic of China?
It’s a moment in time where Asia – especially China - is pivotal in world economic growth. I have been approached by a couple of other schools for becoming dean, but I really was not interested in North America or in Europe again. I also had a couple of approaches within other schools in Asia - in locations which I would describe as Asia light...
When did you decide to come to Shanghai?
As a visiting CEIBS professor in 2009, I wrote a case study about the school and taught it to the faculty members. Looking back, this was fairly important because this enabled the faculty members to find a comfort level with me, even though I had no particular inclination that I would end up in Shanghai in this role. I decided to come in the middle of November 2010.
What are the differences in business education in Asia, especially China and the U.S. and Europe?
Business education in China is very much weighted towards hard skills subjects: finance, economics, accounting, operations and management are all particularly strong areas of interest among the Asian students. Perhaps they would not be so cognisant of the substantial need for soft skills development.
How do you explain this?
Don’t get me wrong: It is not that Europeans and Americans are doing the soft stuff and Chinese are doing the hard stuff. There are even native Chinese who are teaching leadership and entrepreneurship. But as a generalization, I can say: The ability to mix people from different cultures has not only a cultural benefit, but also a soft versus hard skills benefit in the curriculum.
Why would students choose CEIBS or rather Qinghua?
I will not make any comment on any competitor but after my reading of the Qinghua curriculum and faculty mix, it is fair to say, that there the hard skills are more weighted. It is after all called the “Qinghua School of Management and Economics”, not called the Qinghua Business School. The proportions of domestic and international students and teachers are the most important decisions you take as an institution. On our MBA-program there are 45 percent international students. The fulltime faculty mix is about half-half. The position of CEIBS is clearly articulated in four words: China depth and global breadth. No other international school can match us on the China-depth and no Chinese school can match us on the global breadth. The international students are very interested in China and see it as an important step in an international career, maybe with an international company or a Chinese company going international. We make sure that our Chinese students have full exposure to an international environment, so that they are better equipped for going overseas and investing abroad – something the Chinese government now wants them to do.
Nunzio Quacquarelli, managing director of QS – the organisation behind the World MBA Tour, says: “There is a need for innovation in teaching, in course construction, in faculty mix and so on. There is not one right answer, but there is a real need for change.” What do you believe: Are these changes going to come from China and Asia?
With 180 students the size of our MBA-program is small. Therefore we are very flexible and in the midst of an ongoing curriculum evaluation. We want to make responsible leadership a cornerstone of our general management program. Everybody agrees that we shouldn’t be substituting cases on Corporate Social Responsibility for the basic quantity of finance and accounting methods. But we would also like to drive responsible leadership through hard skills courses. I like the responsible leadership idea: People are very surprised when a Chinese institution says it is concerned with it.
Is the idea of responsible leadership popular amongst Chinese business people?
No, but I don’t think that a leading Business School should be just preaching to the choir. There is a segment of our alumni who are very committed to this area, but obviously most business people in China are preoccupied with taking full advantage in the current economic opportunities. It is our responsibility to provide some guidance in this. This is also an arena where non-Chinese students can help to educate Chinese students.
Are these very Western ideas?
No, the new Confucianism expressed by Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao in terms of harmonious society is very much equivalent to our concept of stakeholder capitalism. With 800 graduates per year, we have one of the largest EMBA programs in the world. Our students are chairmen, COOs and presidents of their own companies. Many of them want to take time to explore issues like work-life balance: “How do I manage my marriage and my family when I’m working 100 hours a week without loosing the current opportunities?” They feel this need for guidance. Therefore the concept of responsible leadership has a strong chance to resonate.
Many professors believe that innovation in Business Schools will come from emerging markets like China and India. What is your opinion?
Up to this point, CEIBS was focussed more on knowledge dissemination than on knowledge creation, because we have grown so rapidly. We have to become knowledge generators rather than simply knowledge disseminators - just as China has to advance from a production economy towards a knowledge economy. Therefore we bring strong researchers like Professor George S. Yip to the faculty, the current dean of Erasmus in Rotterdam, who will be joining us as full time faculty member in May. He is of Chinese heritage, teaches international strategy and is an expert in multi-national companies going to China. We will only be able to sustain our claim of „China depth, global breadth“ as long as we are generating new thinking.
Where will CEIBS be in one year?
The number of students will not increase. You can’t simultaneously say: Move towards knowledge creation and double the teaching load. Harvard Business School only admits one percent of all the MBAs in the USA, but if you measure its impact, it’s obviously much greater than one per cent. You don’t need the biggest program to have the most impact. We rather want to have the best applicants in China.
At the moment, the percentage of admittance is 4.5:1 in the MBA-program and 2:1 in the EMBA. The MBA-admittance ratio is satisfactory, but I wish it was more robust. At Harvard it is 10:1 with 9,000 students. At CEIBS it is 4.5:1 with only 180 students. We need to re-assure our Non-Chinese students about the career-opportunities coming out of the school, a question that is related to the sheer brand awareness of CEIBS. This awareness is very strong in China, and I’m working on boosting it globally, so that people would feel more comfortable about it. We are pushing companies who have recruited students from CEIBS for China activities to now put CEIBS on their global fellowship programs. These companies realize that in their global organization they need people with familiarity with China. They don’t just need these people in China.
Do most of the Non-Chinese graduates stay in China?
Out of the international students, 60 percent end up outside of China, quite a few in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, and 40 percent stay in China. Most of the students are people who are taking on a long view on Asia. They are pretty courageous students. It is easy for someone to say: CEIBS is great, but I got admitted to Wharton, it is a great brand and it is better known, more alumni... The people who actually do say yes to CEIBS are a remarkable group of pioneers, particularly those who obviously don’t have any China connections.
How important is it to speak Chinese?
If it was important, I would not have been hired. On the other hand, our international students do have to reach a basic Chinese level. It is kind of a cultural appreciation and we want them to be socializing with our Chinese students.
Business Schools, especially in the US are selling „career-packages“ with their MBA-programs. In China everybody talks about „Guanxi – relations“. You are new in this country. How are you going to create your Guanxi-network?
Our MBA-program has clearly leveraged the existence of the EMBA-program: Any MBA-student can get an EMBA-mentor and two thirds of the students do. The EMBAs are frequently tapped for student projects, case studies, internships and full time job opportunities. The teaching demands of the EMBAs, who are in their 40s, are so high, that the quality of the teaching in the MBA-program is also uplifted. So even though you have this largely domestic EMBA program, the English-language MBA is not swamped, but actually advantaged by its presence.
CEIBS has a campus in Accra, Ghana...
There is hardly any Business School that has serious activities in Africa. If you run such a program, what would normally happen? People back home would say: “Why is my degree being dumbed down and given to people in Africa?” My point would be: “Meet these people, their calibre is extraordinary”. In Africa, to be at a level where you have the motivation, the time and the resources to put yourself through an EMBA program, you need to be extraordinary.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
