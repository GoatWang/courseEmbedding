Obituary
Condolences




























Werner, Elmer Louis Jr.,   83, died Sunday, February 6, 2011 at his home in Paradise Valley, Arizona. A Memorial Service is planned for 11:00 am, Thursday, February 10th at Valley Presbyterian Church. Louis was born in St. Louis, Missouri on November 21, 1927 to the late Elmer Louis and Helen Kready Werner. He was the elder of two sons. After graduating from John Burroughs School, he attended Princeton University, graduating in 1948. Lou received a law degree from Washington University School of Law in 1950, and then enlisted in the US Army Judge Advocate General's (JAG) Corps serving active duty in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas during the Korean War. After 30 years of reserve duty, he retired as Lieutenant Colonel. Following active duty, he joined his father in the insurance business in St. Louis. He became President & CEO of Insurers Service Corporation and Safety Mutual Casualty Corporation. In 1966, he married Sandra Mae Johnston and the couple had three sons. He retired in 1984 and moved to Paradise Valley, Arizona. Lou was an ardent contributor to the community, serving Phoenix Country Day School, Valley Presbyterian Church, The FBI Citizens Academy, the San Francisco Theological Seminary, the Phoenix Symphony, the Fiesta Bowl, the Scottsdale Healthcare Foundation and, as Judge, the Town of Paradise Valley. Lou was an avid pilot, golfer, swimmer, traveler, reader, wordsmith, and football fan. He was a generous, understanding, loving husband and father who greeted everyone with a warm smile and a firm handshake, and was always, "Optimistic." In addition to his wife, he is survived by his three adoring sons, E. Louis III and his wife Lea, Eric Raymond and his wife Rachel, and Matthew Jacob and Ashley Fisher. His four beloved grandchildren, Gibson Grace, Addisen Mae, Louis IV and Evan Anne will miss him dearly. In lieu of flowers, Memorial contributions may be  made to the E.L. Werner, Jr. Memorial Fund (Military Training Center/Osborn), Scottsdale Healthcare Foundation, 1001 N. 92nd Street, Suite 121, Scottsdale, AZ 85258.

              How can I confirm the duty rating and load capacity of an existing Werner ladder?                     The ladder is a 2 stage extension ladder with each section measuring 14 ft 9 in and having 18 D shaped rungs. The ladder labels show that manufacture was in the UK under license from Werner to Stephen &amp; Carter Limited and records the stock number as D1240. I have been in touch with Arbu UK who advised contact with you. The ladder was made around 1982 and has just been gifted to our Salvation Army Church in Ipswich, UK and the details are needed to ensure correct use. I can provide further details or photos if this would help.         Asked by: Anonymous             Please contact our Customer Care Department when convenient at 888-523-3370 Monday through Friday 8 AM till 5 PM EST for further details on your issue and/or question.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-04-08                Where can I get replacement parts for this ladder. I have entered the model # but can't find the mark #. I need the part that keeps                     the bracket away from the rung as you try to lower the ladder.         Asked by: Anonymous             The MK number should be located on the duty rating on the side rail of the ladder. If you do not see it there please look on the bottom 4ft of each side rail. A code stamp should be engraved there which is a series of numbers and letters.
Example: 0987 44C 12
-the 12 would be the MK #

With that information you can go on our website and find the replacement parts available for your ladder.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-05-15                Explain Reach height and working height                     Explain Reach height and working height. Is reach height, the length of the ladder? (not the elevation to the top of the ladder off the ground) Is working height where your feet are or where your work is, in elevation from off the ground or length of ladder?         Asked by: Anonymous             Ladder specifications can be confusing due to safety regulation requirements. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), the ladder size is defined as the total length of each section and does not account for overlap on extension ladders. As a result, the overlapping sections reduce the total length of the ladder. When purchasing any ladder customers should pay particular attention to the maximum reach to ensure the correct product for the job. To determine this would be the ladder height and the maximum reach of a 5'6&quot; person with a vertical 12&quot; reach.

You can contact the Customer Care Department at 888-523-3370 Monday through Friday 8 AM until 5PM EST. We can email you an illustration of the maximum ladder height and reach height.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-06-13                Is a 32' Type III ladder still considered safe to use                     I have a 32' Type III aluminum Werner ladder rated for 200 lbs. that is almost 30 years old. I don't see Type III ladders sold in this length anymore. Although it is in excellent condition, I wonder if it no longer meets industry standards for safety. Should it no longer be used, or is it safe as long as it is not extended beyond a certain length?         Asked by: Anonymous             Please contact Customer Care at 888-523-3370 Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM EST. We do still manufacture the D1128-2 and it is OSHA/ANSI approved. Please go to the following link, to see the ladder:
http://www.wernerco.com/us/en/view/Products/Climbing%20Equipment/Extension%20Ladders/D1100-2/D1128-2

We can email you a ladder safety inspection form to inspect your ladder, to make sure it is in good condition and safe to use. The duty rating of 200 lbs. is the weight of the person and anything they are carrying on the ladder, it is not to exceed the 200 lbs. duty rating. Do not use the ladder, if you have any questions or feel it is unsafe.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2017-06-21                I have a D1132-2?                     Why can't I find any information on this ladder ????         Asked by: Anonymous             We do not have a 32' model in our D1100-2 series. It may be possible you have a D1232-2, which would be a 32' with a 225lb rating.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-11-12                is there an aluinum 32 footer type III?                     weight         Asked by: Anonymous             We do not manufacture a 32ft type III extension ladder. The type III only goes to a height of 28FT.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-02-18                Can Werner ladders be used as a ladder gin?           Asked by: Anonymous             We do not suggest using our ladders as a ladder gin. This is not something that we have tested so we cannot suggest this for safety purposes.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-05-06                Replacement parts fo D1116-2.                     When I type in the D1116-2 model number for replacement parts the site tells me that &quot;no results available for this product&quot; I am in need of some new mar resistant end caps and a new spring loaded rung lock.         Asked by: Anonymous             Werner Co does not manufacture any replacement parts for ladders that are 15 years or older. The model and mark number on the ladder determine when the ladder was manufactured. If you are having problems locating the mark number on your ladder please contact our Customer Care Department when convenient at 888-523-3370 Monday through Friday 8 AM till 5 PM EST for further details on your issue and/or question.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2017-03-27                Please explain the difference between the working length of 21' and the reach height of 23'. Is 21' the actual length in the fully extended position?           Asked by: Anonymous             The working length of the ladder is the overall length of the ladder when it is extended to maximum.

When the ladder is at its maximum working length, the reach height is the height a user can safely reach when standing at the highest allowable rung.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2016-05-15                What is a type III duty Rating?           Asked by: Anonymous             A type III duty rating is rated at 200lbs.

Different types of ladders are designed to keep you safe and productive when 
climbing or standing. Using the wrong style of ladder or simply ignoring the 
limitations of climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury.
                








                Height is referring to the actual ladder height. Extension ladders should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the highest support or contact point, which may be the wall or roof line. The highest standing level is four rungs down from the top. The highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top.
                
Reach height is the maximum reach assuming a 5’6” person with a vertical 12” reach.
            




    
    Ladders are designed to safely hold up to a specific amount of weight. The Werner Performance System defines five different capacities using a color and star rating system. 
	The Duty Rating is defined as the maximum safe load capacity of the ladder. A person’s fully clothed weight plus the weight of any tools and 
	materials that are carried onto the ladder must be less than the load capacity. 
	



    
Werner offers ladder made from fiberglass and aluminum. Each material has characteristics which 
make it best for certain applications, or one material may simply fit the personal preferences 
of the user. For example, if working around electricity users should select fiberglass products 
due to their non-conductive side rails.
