Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Bluebird Prepaid Card


                                            Bluebird is okay, but the issue I have is not many establishments accept American Express. I went to a gas station and swiped at the pump and received an error. So I went inside and they told me that they do not accept the card and I was on "E". It's a good thing...show more

                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

First PREMIER® Bank Mastercard Credit Card


                                            Do you have to link your personal bank account to pay the fees for the card. How do you pay your bill monthly. I see other people comment about they took money out of there bank account. How did they get their bank information from.

North Carolina Farm Bureau Insurance Group


                                            I highly recommend Farm Bureau Insurance. Nathan Ray cares about his clients.

                                            The worst insurance company experience in 35 years. Bought a second home and added it to main house, two cars/drivers, and umbrella policy. After 7 years as customer, never a claim, they sent inspector to new second home and then I received a cancellation notice due to...show more

                                            After getting fed-up with SEFCU’s “nickel-and-dime” fee structure and lack of branches/ATMs in my area, I decided to close my account in April 2017. Fast forward to July 25, 2017 when I receive a collection notice for fees due ($175). Access to my online...show more
