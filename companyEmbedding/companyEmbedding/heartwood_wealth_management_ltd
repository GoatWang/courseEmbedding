Process








Approach


Process


Multi asset strategies 


Financial Planners





Process

Our investment process is disciplined and transparent. Yet we retain the freedom to invest with conviction.



For each of our investment strategies, we begin with a strategic asset allocation. This acts as a reference point for our decision making.
To build the strategic allocations we analyse past and likely future performance from all major asset classes – equities, bonds, cash, property, private equity, hedge funds and commodities.
In creating a strategic allocation, we seek to achieve an optimal blend of these different assets. This blend is broadly diversified and – if bought and held for the long term – should deliver the objective of the investment strategy. The strategic asset allocation also reflects the amount of risk we are prepared to take in order to achieve the target returns.
Tactical asset allocation
While the strategic allocations provide a framework, our portfolios will deviate substantially from these, based on our assessment of the opportunities and risks across asset markets.
The degree of variation will depend on a number of factors, but we set no maximum or minimum limits for each asset class. It is the overall risk of the portfolio and the contributors to that risk that we monitor closely, to ensure that each strategy is run in a manner consistent with its mandate. 
We also use our tactical allocation to introduce themes and ideas into our investment strategies. These are designed to improve returns by capturing the opportunities we see in the markets over the coming 3 to 18 months.

        "Well done is better than well said."

                Benjamin Franklin

Portfolio construction
When constructing portfolios, we are focused on delivering the best value and returns for our clients, and are constantly assessing options for their investment potential, cost, risk and tax effectiveness. 
Often the most appropriate investment will vary greatly between asset classes, regions, markets and sectors – and over time. We therefore invest in a range of vehicles, including directly-held securities, passive funds, active funds, and derivative- backed securities. 
Team responsibilities 
Within the team, individuals have responsibility for both portfolio management and investment research, specialising in a particular asset class, region or investment area. 
Our approach to decision making is collegiate. We are a close-knit team taking decisions together, monitoring progress together and sharing responsibility for the results.

Our culture

Two words summarise the way we work – collective and accountable.



A team approach
Many investment firms put the spotlight on a few individuals. Heartwood is different, harnessing the combined strength of the whole team so that great ideas always get the attention they deserve.
Decisions face a healthy challenge. Recommendations are debated. And we take collective responsibility for delivering returns that meet or exceed our clients’ expectations.
Accountable for results
When managing investments, we expect to be held accountable.
We believe clients have a right to be told, clearly, how their investment strategy is performing. In our communication, we strive to be open and frank, in both good times and bad.
Building on that, we try to make ourselves accessible, creating opportunities for clients to meet and directly question members of our investment team.
Learn more about our investment approach
Our history
Heartwood’s origins date back to 1988 and we have built our reputation as specialists in sophisticated multi asset investing.
In 2013, Heartwood became part of Handelsbanken, a Swedish banking group that has grown rapidly across the UK. The merger brought together two companies with similar cultures and a shared emphasis on excellent client service.

Approach








Approach

Multi asset strategies 


Financial Planners





Approach

As specialists in global multi asset investing, we focus on making intelligent asset allocation decisions and diversifying properly to manage risk.



Why our approach? In short, because it is proven, robust, consistent and transparent.
Each of our investment strategies has a clear target return, and we focus on delivering positive real returns over the long term. This objective promotes transparency and focus, for both us and our clients.
We invest from the top down, first identifying an optimal blend of asset classes, then actively managing it over time, anticipating and adjusting to changes in market conditions.
When doing this, our work is grounded in analysis of the fundamentals. We are interested in the true underlying value of an investment, not its current popularity.
We focus on making investments capable of delivering good long term performance, rather than chasing the latest market fad.
Read more about Heartwood’s investment process

        "Whether you are investing for growth or seeking a reliable and steady income, Heartwood’s multi asset approach allows you to benefit from opportunities in asset classes, sectors and themes worldwide."

                Noland Carter, Head of Heartwood Investment Management and Chief Investment Officer

Managing risks
Robust risk management is one of several things that sets Heartwood apart.
We use a wide variety of measures to assess risk, emphasising real-world factors that matter most to clients. Our operational due diligence on investments is thorough, leaving no stone unturned. And we use industry-leading risk monitoring and analysis tools to aid clear thinking.
To us, disciplined risk management is essential if we are to be good stewards of wealth and to meet or exceed the targets we set.
Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance.

Important information











Important information

Heartwood Investment Management (Heartwood) is a division of Heartwood Wealth Management Ltd, which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the conduct of investment business, and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Svenska Handelsbanken AB (publ).



Registered Head Office:
No.1 KingswayLondonWC2B 6AN
Registered in England number:
4132340
VAT number:
524 9824 25
Heartwood Wealth Management Limited is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the conduct of investment business with firm reference number: 197340. Tax advice which contains no investment element is not regulated by the FCA. By accessing these pages, you shall be deemed to have accepted, and agreed to be bound, by the terms of these legal notices which shall be governed by the Law of England.
Risk warnings
The pages on this site have been prepared by Heartwood for the general interest of readers. They are not intended to be a definitive analysis of equity or other markets. Nothing herein constitutes advice to undertake a transaction in a particular share or other security, and professional advice should be taken on specific issues and before any course of action is pursued. The value of any investment and the income from it is not guaranteed and can fall as well as rise, so that you may not realise the amount originally invested. If we select or recommend a particular investment strategy or model for one client it does not imply that it is suitable for any other client. Neither past performance nor forecasts are reliable indicators of future performance. Directors or employees of Heartwood Wealth Management Ltd may have a position or holding in any of the investments mentioned in the pages on this site and may have provided advice or investment services in relation to any of the investments mentioned within the last 12 months.
Segregated portfolios may include individual investments in structured products, foreign currencies, and funds (including funds not regulated by the FCA) which may individually have a relatively high risk profile. They may specifically include hedge funds, property funds, private equity funds and other funds which may have limited liquidity. While we aim to follow a disciplined model portfolio approach, any individual portfolio is unlikely to be identical to that of the relevant model portfolio as a result of (inter alia) the time of commencement of the portfolio, the precise mandate or risk profile you may have given us (including any investment preferences and/or restrictions), tax constraints, the tax status of any investment vehicles used, and the availability of certain funds or other investments.
Restricted advice
We offer restricted advice, as defined by the FCA, which means that that if we recommend an investment solution it will be from one of Heartwood Investment Management’s investment strategies or multi-asset funds. If, based on your personal circumstances, it is appropriate for us to advise on pensions or other products outside an investment management relationship, we will recommend products chosen from a limited selection of providers that we have selected on the basis of our belief in their quality of service, investor protection, financial strength and, if relevant, their financial performance.
Our investment management
Our investment strategies are offered either as models (where you will hold each individual investment within the applicable model) or are wrapped within Multi-Asset Funds (MAFs) that are managed by Heartwood. If we believe that one or more of these funds are suitable for you, we may hold the fund(s) within a portfolio on your behalf. Heartwood-managed funds in turn may be invested in funds managed by third parties and include investments in other asset classes selected by us from the whole of the market.
Compensation
We are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. Clients may be entitled to compensation from the scheme if Heartwood Wealth Management Limited cannot meet its obligations. This depends on the type of business and the circumstances of the claim. Most types of investment business are covered for 100% of the first £50,000. For further information about compensation arrangements is available from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
Residence
The pages on this site are prepared and issued in the United Kingdom and are intended for the information of United Kingdom residents only. In particular, the information on this site is not for distribution and does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy any securities.
General

Multi asset strategies

At Heartwood, we have chosen to concentrate our expertise on a focused range of investment strategies; Total Return, Income and Ethical.



In our experience, most people’s investment objectives map very closely to one of four broad categories. At Heartwood, we label these categories Defensive, Cautious, Balanced and Growth. For each, we have an investment strategy that seeks to deliver a return at or above a set target level.

Performance targets
Each strategy has a benchmark target which is aligned to its risk profile. Over the long-term investment cycle strategies aim to meet or exceed their target.
Our team have the ability to invest across a broad range of global assets, regions and sectors without the restrictions often associated with aligning to a market-based index. These benchmarks are intended to assist us in providing clients with a predictable investment journey - one that is consistent and steady, and seeks to minimise downside risk.
 

*The benchmarks shown above relate to the Heartwood Investment Management strategies which the CF Heartwood Multi Asset Funds are managed to and are shown for comparison purposes only as the funds do not have formal benchmarks.
Accessing the strategies
Our global multi asset strategies can be accessed in a number of ways. The most popular route is through our multi asset funds. These funds are efficient and have a number of benefits, including the absence of VAT on the annual management charge, and deferred Capital Gains Tax while fully invested.
Heartwood also offers segregated portfolios (with minimum investment requirements) for those who prefer this structure. Our ethical strategies are currently only available as segregated portfolios.
