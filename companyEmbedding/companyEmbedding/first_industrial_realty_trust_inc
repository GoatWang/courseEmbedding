First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc. (NYSE:   FR), a leading fully integrated owner, operator and developer of industrial real estate, today announced results for the second quarter of 2017. Diluted net income available to common stockholders per share (EPS) was $0.32 in the second quarter, compared to $0.43 a year ago. 
First Industrial's second quarter FFO was $0.38 per share/unit on a diluted basis, compared to $0.36 per share/unit a year ago. Second quarter 2017 results included a $0.01 per share impact from income tax related to the sale of a property from the Company's taxable REIT subsidiary.  
"The U.S. industrial real estate market continues to exhibit healthy fundamentals that provide a supportive environment for continuing market rent growth," said Peter E. Baccile, First Industrial's president and CEO. "Our results reflect the underlying strength of the market and our team's efforts to drive future cash flow growth and value from our portfolio and new investments." 
Portfolio Performance – Second Quarter 2017

In service occupancy was 95.7% at the end of the second quarter, compared to 95.8% at the end of the first quarter of 2017, and 95.8% at the end of the second quarter of 2016. Sales contributed 30 basis points to second quarter 2017 occupancy as compared to the first quarter of 2017. 
Tenants were retained in 79.5% of square footage up for renewal. 
Same property cash basis net operating income (NOI) increased 4.2%. Including lease termination fees, same property NOI increased 4.3%. 
Rental rates increased 9.2% on a cash basis and increased 19.7% on a GAAP basis; leasing costs were $1.90 per square foot.

Capital Markets Activity
In the second quarter, the Company:

Closed on $200 million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes in a private placement offering with a weighted average interest rate of 4.34%. The notes are comprised of two tranches: $125 million with a 10-year term at an interest rate of 4.30% and $75 million with a 12-year term at an interest rate of 4.40%.   
Paid off $102 million of its 5.95% 2017 Senior Unsecured Notes at maturity. 
Had its Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating affirmed by Moody's Investor Service which also revised its rating outlook to "positive" from "stable." 
Raised approximately $75 million via an underwritten offering of 2.56 million common shares.

"Our strong financial position supports our efforts to profitably grow our portfolio through targeted investments," said Scott Musil, chief financial officer. "Our return to the unsecured debt markets in the second quarter provided us with lower cost, long-term capital that contributes to cash flow growth."  
Investment and Disposition Activities
In the second quarter, the Company:

Acquired four buildings totaling 514,000 square feet and two land parcels for $79.5 million comprising: 

a 123,000 square-foot facility in San Diego for $21.5 million; 
a 106,000 square-foot building in the Inland Empire for $12.5 million; 
a 181,000 square-foot facility in Denver for $11.2 million; 
a 103,000 square-foot building in Orlando for $8.0 million; 
a 66-acre land parcel in Phoenix for $11.6 million fully leased to UPS; and 
a 97-acre development site in Phoenix for $14.7 million.

Sold eight buildings comprised of 717,000 square feet for $38.6 million.

In the third quarter to date, the Company:

Sold three buildings totaling 389,000 square feet for $18.3 million. 

"In a highly competitive investment market, our team was successful in sourcing four quality building acquisitions in markets with strong long-term rent growth characteristics," said Johannson Yap, chief investment officer of First Industrial. "Our disposition efforts continue to be an essential part of our portfolio management process, through which we seek to maximize value while providing capital for reinvestment."
Development Leasing
In the second quarter, the Company signed the following development lease:

618,000 square feet plus a 66-acre land parcel at First Park @ PV 303 in Phoenix to UPS, a global leader in logistics.

Outlook for 2017
Mr. Baccile stated, "Excluding the loss on retirement of debt from our financing activities and the income tax impact from the sale of one of our assets during the second quarter, the midpoint of our revised FFO guidance is $0.01 higher than our prior guidance. The change largely reflects our Phoenix development lease and our second quarter same store NOI performance, partially offset by property sales dilution and short-term net dilution from our recent equity offering. Consistent with our overall strategy, our focus for the remainder of 2017 is to drive future cash flow growth from growing rents and leasing up opportunities within our portfolio including our developments and value-add investments."

The following assumptions were used: 

Average quarter-end in service occupancy of 95.5% to 96.5%. 
Same-store NOI growth on a cash basis before termination fees of 3.5% to 5.0% for the full year, an increase of 25 basis points at the midpoint, reflecting second quarter results. 
General and administrative expense of approximately $26 million to $27 million. 
Guidance includes the incremental costs expected in 2017 related to the Company's completed and under construction developments as of June 30, 2017. In total, the Company expects to capitalize $0.03 per share of interest related to these projects in 2017. 
Guidance reflects the impact of the property sales in the third quarter to-date and the planned retirement of $55 million of its 7.5% 2017 Notes maturity in December. 
Other than the above, guidance does not include the impact of: 

any other future debt repurchases prior to maturity or future debt issuances; 
any future investments or property sales; 
any future NAREIT-compliant gains or losses; 
any future impairment gains or losses; or 
any future equity issuance.


A number of factors could impact our ability to deliver results in line with our assumptions, such as interest rates, the economy, the supply and demand of industrial real estate, the availability and terms of financing to potential acquirers of real estate, the timing and yields for divestment and investment, and numerous other variables. There can be no assurance that First Industrial can achieve such results.

FFO Definition
First Industrial reports FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition to provide a comparative measure to other REITs. NAREIT recommends that REITs define FFO as net income, excluding gains (or losses) from the sale of previously depreciated property, plus depreciation and amortization, excluding impairments from previously depreciated assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.

 a) Effective January 1, 2017, we adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2017-01, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business" ("ASU 2017-01"), which clarifies the framework for determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities meets the definition of a business. The revised framework establishes a screen for determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities is a business and narrows the definition of a business, which is expected to result in fewer transactions being accounted for as business combinations. Acquisitions of integrated sets of assets and activities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions. We anticipate that our acquisitions of real estate in the future will generally not meet the definition of a business combination; and accordingly, transaction costs which have historically been expensed, will be capitalized as part of the basis of the real estate assets acquired. ASU 2017-01 was applied prospectively.  b) Investors in, and analysts following, the real estate industry utilize funds from operations ("FFO"), net operating income ("NOI"), adjusted EBITDA and adjusted funds from operations ("AFFO"), variously defined below, as supplemental performance measures.  While we believe net income available to First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.'s common stockholders and participating securities, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate measure, we consider FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO, given their wide use by, and relevance to investors and analysts, appropriate supplemental performance measures.  FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets.  NOI provides a measure of rental operations, and does not factor in depreciation and amortization and non-property specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses.  Adjusted EBITDA provides a tool to further evaluate the ability to incur and service debt and to fund dividends and other cash needs.  AFFO provides a tool to further evaluate the ability to fund dividends.  In addition, FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO are commonly used in various ratios, pricing multiples/yields and returns and valuation calculations used to measure financial position, performance and value. As used herein, we calculate FFO to be equal to net income available to First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc.'s common stockholders and participating securities, plus depreciation and other amortization of real estate, minus gain on sale of depreciable real estate. NOI is defined as our revenues, minus property expenses such as real estate taxes, repairs and maintenance, property management, utilities, insurance and other expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as NOI, minus general and administrative expenses and acquisition costs. AFFO is defined as adjusted EBITDA minus GAAP interest expense, minus capitalized interest and overhead, plus amortization of debt discounts / (premiums) and hedge costs, minus straight-line rental income, amortization of above (below) market leases and lease inducements, minus provision for income taxes or plus benefit for income taxes, plus restricted stock/unit amortization, minus non-incremental capital expenditures. Non-incremental capital expenditures refer to building improvements and leasing costs required to maintain current revenues plus tenant improvements amortized back to the tenant over the lease term. Excluded are first generation leasing costs, capital expenditures underwritten at acquisition and development/redevelopment costs.  FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs, including the repayment of principal on debt and payment of dividends and distributions.  FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO should not be considered as substitutes for net income available to common stockholders and participating securities (calculated in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of results of operations or cash flows (calculated in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of liquidity.  FFO, NOI, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO as currently calculated by us may not be comparable to similarly titled, but variously calculated, measures of other REITs.                                                                                                                                                                                    In addition, we consider cash-basis same store NOI ("SS NOI") to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. Same store properties include all properties owned prior to January 1, 2016 and held as an in service property through the end of the current reporting period, and developments and redevelopments that were placed in service or were substantially completed for 12 months prior to January 1, 2016 (the "Same Store Pool"). We define SS NOI as NOI, less NOI of properties not in the Same Store Pool, less the impact of straight-line rent, the amortization of lease inducements, the amortization of above (below) market rent and the impact of lease termination fees. We exclude straight-line rent, amortization of lease inducements and above (below) market rent in calculating SS NOI because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a year-over-year comparison. In addition, we believe that SS NOI helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a company's real estate as compared to other companies. While SS NOI is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts, it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance. SS NOI also does not reflect general and administrative expense, acquisition costs, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income tax benefit and expense, gains and losses on retirement of debt, sale of real estate, capital expenditures and leasing costs, or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations. Further, our computation of SS NOI may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies, as they may use different methodologies for calculating SS NOI.
