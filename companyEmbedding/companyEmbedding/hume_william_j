Job Details
               Headquartered in Walnut Creek, California and privately held, Basic American Foods is one of the world's leading suppliers of convenience food products, including dry potato and bean products. Founded more than 75 years ago, Basic American Foods serves foodservice distributors, commercial and non-commercial foodservice operators, industrial, wholesale club, and retail customers in domestic and international markets.
Title: Member of the Boards
               Company: The Heritage Foundation
Job Details
               Founded in 1973, The Heritage Foundation is a research and educational institution-a think tank-whose mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense. We believe the principles and ideas of the American Founding are worth conserving and renewing. As policy entrepreneurs, we believe the most effective solutions are consistent with those ideas and principles. Our vision is to build an America where freedom, opportunity, prosperity, and civil society flourish. Heritage's staff pursues this mission by performing timely, accurate research on key policy issues and effectively marketing these findings to our primary audiences: members of Congress, key congressional staff members, policymakers in the executive branch, the nation's news media, and the academic and policy communities. The Heritage Foundation's research staff is organized under three Institutes, each devoted to developing policies grounded in conservative principles that will strengthen our economy, our society, and America. • The Institute for Economic Freedom and Opportunity seeks to promote a stronger economy and consists of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies, the Chief Economist's Office, the Center for Trade and Economics, and the Center for Data Analysis. • The Institute for Family, Community, and Opportunity promotes a stronger society and consists of the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society, the B. Kenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics, the Center for Health Policy Studies, and the Domestic Policy Studies staff. • The Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy promotes a stronger America and consists of the Douglas and Sarah Allison Center for Foreign and National Security Policy, and the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom, the Asian Studies Center, and the International Studies staff. Working in conjunction with all three Institutes are Heritage's Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies and the Research Editing staff. The Heritage Foundation combines the three key elements necessary to achieve conservative policy successes - effective research, superb communications, and first-rate advocacy. The Research, Strategic Communications, and Policy Promotion teams, supported by the Development Team and working with the leaders and advocates at Heritage Action for America and its team across the country, pursue conservative policies to help Americans build for themselves a better life. Governed by an independent Board of Trustees, The Heritage Foundation is an independent, tax-exempt institution. Heritage relies on the private financial support of the general public-individuals, foundations, and corporations-for its income, and accepts no government funds and performs no contract work. Heritage is one of the nation's largest public policy research organizations. Its hundreds of thousands of individual members make it the most broadly supported think tank in America.
