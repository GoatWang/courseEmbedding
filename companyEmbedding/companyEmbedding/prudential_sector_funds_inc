Past performance does not guarantee future results and current performance may be lower or higher than the past performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. This chart represents historical performance and does not assume the effects of sales charges. If shown with sales charges, performance would have been lower.

Source: Morningstar. The Morningstar Rating may not be calculated based on its share class adjusted historical returns. If so, this investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric uses the fund's oldest share class to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. 2017 Morningstar, Inc.

Fixed income investments are subject to credit, market, and interest rate risks, and their value will decline as interest rates rise; call and redemption risk, where the issuer may call a bond held by the Fund for redemption before it matures and the Fund may lose income; and liquidity risk, which exists when particular investments are difficult to sell.  The Fund may invest in high yield ("junk") bonds, which are subject to greater credit and market risks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment, extension, and interest rate risks; floating rate loans, which subjects the Fund to the risk that the Fund’s ability to receive payments in connection with loans depends on the financial condition of the borrower (failure to receive such payments may reduce the value of the Fund’s assets); and derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks. To the extent the Fund invests in U.S. government and agency securities, its potential for capital appreciation may be limited. The Fund may not be invested in all sectors at a given time. The risks associated with the Fund are more fully explained in the prospectus and summary prospectus. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets. These risks may increase the Fund’s share price volatility. There is no guarantee the Fund’s objective will be achieved.

Average Maturity is the average time to maturity for a bond. Credit quality is calculated using the highest rating assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) such as Moody’s, S&P, or Fitch. The Not Rated category consists of securities that have not been rated by an NRSRO. Duration measures investment risk that takes into account both a bond's interest payments and its value to maturity. Standard Deviation depicts how widely returns vary around its average and is used to understand the range of returns most likely for a given fund. A higher standard deviation generally implies greater volatility. Due to data availability, statistics may not be as of the current reporting period.
