	The  new 147,000-square-foot Seng-Liang Wang Hall, located just north of the Northwestern Avenue Parking Garage, provides laboratories, offices, conference rooms, and support facilities for the College of Engineering. The  School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the primary tenant, occupies 40 percent of the innovative, multipurpose building.

	To help provide new facilities for Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), Patrick Wang, (BSEE ’72, MSEE, ’72, HDR ’04) and his wife, Lucy, both of Hong Kong, contributed the lead gift to the building, naming it in honor of Patrick’s late father. “My father did not have the opportunity to finish high school, let alone college, but he toiled tirelessly so I and other members of my family could go to college in America,” said Patrick. What Seng-Liang may have lacked in formal education, he made up for in ingenuity, character, dedication, entrepreneurship, and a strong belief in the value of education. In 1959, he founded Johnson Electric in Hong Kong, which today is a growing multinational company for which Patrick now serves as chairman and chief executive officer.

	Under Patrick’s leadership, Johnson Electric has evolved from a $2 million company best known for producing motors for high-end model racing cars, to a leader in motion subsystems, serving many industries including automotive, building automation, business machines, home technologies, health care, and power tools. 

	Patrick said he hopes that the building will afford students opportunities to flourish in ways that will contribute to a brighter future. “I was fortunate to be born to parents who were entrepreneurs. Their unwavering belief in me, and their mentorship, imbued in me a ‘can do’ attitude and a resilience to setbacks,” he said. “It is my wish that this building will be the place to nurture talents for professional excellence as well as entrepreneurship — so these things can make our world a better place for future generations.”

2016 Electrical & Computer Engineering Awards


I am delighted to recognize the 2016 Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineers as we celebrate not only the successes of our OECEs, but the successes of our on-campus ECE family as well. Our OECE honorees join a distinguished group of alumni who have previously received this honor, engineers who represent the finest in their fields, and who embody the spirit of Purdue Engineering, applying a world view to work that has a universal impact.
            


We are proud to count each of our honorees among the Purdue ECE family of extraordinary people who are making a global impact. Please join me in congratulating our ECE honorees and our 2016 OECE honorees as they receive the School of Electrical and Computer Engineeringâs top accolade for professional achievement.
 
- Leah Jamieson, John A. Edwardson Dean of Engineering and Ransburg Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering

The Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineering (OECE) awards celebration â recognizing the achievements of alumni and faculty â is a highlight event each year. This year marks the first time in our 128-year-old history when our faculty size exceeds the 100 mark. And many of our performance metrics are at record or near-record levels. As we near the end of the planned engineering expansion, we are well-positioned to achieve even greater levels of excellence.


This evening I am pleased to congratulate a special group - the newest class of Outstanding Electrical and Computer Engineering alumni. We are proud of their achievements and Iâm honored to welcome them to an elite group. Their accomplishments along with those of our faculty serve as an inspiration to all of us, and especially to our students as they set out to make a difference in the world. 
- V. "Ragu" Balakrishnan, Michael and Katherine Birck Head and Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering
