McIntosh MA 9000 Integrated Amplifier
		

The MA9000 Integrated Amplifier can help you achieve audio perfection. McIntosh's largest integrated in both size and power, it offers 300 Watts per channel and combines their amplifier and preamplifier expertise into one comprehensive unit. It has a built-in 32-bit DAC and a DA1 Digital Audio Module, that allows future upgrades.  It includes a USB input that can support DSD256 and DXD 348kHz files.  And the MA9000 features the new McIntosh Monogrammed Heatsinks™ that are made from high quality materials with excellent thermal conductivity properties.
		







McIntosh MC1.2KW Power Amplifier
		

Producing a massive 1,200 watts, the MC1.2KW can now be auditioned at Overture.  The MC1.2KW features the extraordinary McIntosh Quad Balanced Circuit. Each amplifier consists of two balanced amplifier circuits, the outputs of which are combined in the unique, hand-crafted McIntosh Output Autoformer.  Both customers and staff alike have been astounded by their powerful bass response and extraordinary dynamic range.  Speakers of all efficiencies will benefit from the power output and reserves of the MC1.2KW's.

Fixed analog stereo outputs are available in both balanced and unbalanced offerings; a coax and optical output are also available if you prefer to send the digital audio signal to an external DAC, preamplifier or home theater processor.
		










McIntosh D1100 Preamp
		

The D1100 Digital Preamplifier is a reference level stereo preamplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Its 8-channel, 32-bit DAC is used in Quad Balanced mode, with half of it dedicated to the left audio channel and the other half to the right channel. It's the most advanced DAC McIntosh has ever used and delivers an unprecedented level of performance so that all digital music is reproduced with exceptional accuracy and authenticity.
		










McIntosh MP100 Preamp
		

The MP100 is the first dedicated phono preamplifier from McIntosh and is designed to help both new and experienced vinyl lovers get the most fidelity, performance and – most importantly – enjoyment from their albums. Hi-Fi News magazine has reviewed it and have awarded the MP100 their "Highly Commended" ranking.  "This is a clean-sounding, detailed, commanding phono amp that also represents excellent value. It’s compact, beautifully-made in the McIntosh manner and easy to use. Once the features are accounted for, especially XLR balanced out, you realise that it’s actually something of a bargain.

McIntosh's largest integrated in both size and power, it offers 300 Watts per channel and combines their amplifier and preamplifier expertise into one comprehensive unit. It has a built-in 32-bit DAC and a DA1 Digital Audio Module, that allows future upgrades.  It includes a USB input that can support DSD256 and DXD 348kHz files.  And the MA9000 features the new McIntosh Monogrammed Heatsinks™ that are made from high quality materials with excellent thermal conductivity properties.
		







McIntosh MC1.2KW Power Amplifier
		

Producing a massive 1,200 watts, the MC1.2KW can now be auditioned at Overture.  The MC1.2KW features the extraordinary McIntosh Quad Balanced Circuit. Each amplifier consists of two balanced amplifier circuits, the outputs of which are combined in the unique, hand-crafted McIntosh Output Autoformer.  Both customers and staff alike have been astounded by their powerful bass response and extraordinary dynamic range.  Speakers of all efficiencies will benefit from the power output and reserves of the MC1.2KW's.

Fixed analog stereo outputs are available in both balanced and unbalanced offerings; a coax and optical output are also available if you prefer to send the digital audio signal to an external DAC, preamplifier or home theater processor.
		










McIntosh D1100 Preamp
		

The D1100 Digital Preamplifier is a reference level stereo preamplifier and digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Its 8-channel, 32-bit DAC is used in Quad Balanced mode, with half of it dedicated to the left audio channel and the other half to the right channel. It's the most advanced DAC McIntosh has ever used and delivers an unprecedented level of performance so that all digital music is reproduced with exceptional accuracy and authenticity.
		










McIntosh MP100 Preamp
		

The MP100 is the first dedicated phono preamplifier from McIntosh and is designed to help both new and experienced vinyl lovers get the most fidelity, performance and – most importantly – enjoyment from their albums. Hi-Fi News magazine has reviewed it and have awarded the MP100 their "Highly Commended" ranking.  "This is a clean-sounding, detailed, commanding phono amp that also represents excellent value. It’s compact, beautifully-made in the McIntosh manner and easy to use. Once the features are accounted for, especially XLR balanced out, you realise that it’s actually something of a bargain.
