MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER TRANSFERING VENUE
JOHN R. TUNHEIM, District Judge.
The question before the Court is whether exercising jurisdiction over a lawsuit filed in Minnesota, while the same parties are currently involved in litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia after a venue change, is proper. The Court ordered the parties to submit simultaneous supplemental briefing on the issues of jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), compulsory counter claims, and the doctrine of abstention, as outlined in Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976); see also Mo. ex rel. Nixon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 259 F.3d 949, 953 (8th Cir. 2001). Both parties have responded. For the reasons set forth below, the Court transfers venue to the Northern District of Georgia.
BACKGROUND
The defendants in this litigation (collectively, "Noteholders") were plaintiffs in an earlier action brought in the District of Minnesota against CompuCredit Holdings Corporation ("CompuCredit"), who is the plaintiff in this action. Akanthos Capital Mgmt., LLC et al. v. CompuCredit Holdings Corp., Case No. 09-cv-3664 (D. Minn. Dec. 21, 2009) (hereinafter, the "Georgia litigation"). In that litigation, CompuCredit moved for a transfer of venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), citing expense and the convenience of the parties. The Court granted the request for a change of venue to the Northern District of Georgia.
Within weeks of the transfer, CompuCredit filed suit in Minnesota alleging antitrust violations (the "Minnesota litigation"). (Docket No. 1.) The allegations in the Minnesota litigation are closely related to the issues in the Georgia litigation. For example, Noteholders' complaint in the Georgia litigation alleges that on December 3, 2009, CompuCredit announced a plan to give away $24 million and spin off a profitable subsidiary primarily to insiders. (Compl. ¶ 21-26, Docket No. 1). This announcement resulted in a dramatic drop in the trading prices of CompuCredit notes. After the drop in prices, CompuCredit initiated a tender offer for the notes at the lower prices. Noteholders boycotted this tender offer, which is a key fact in CompuCredit's antitrust claims in the Minnesota litigation. (Id.) Noteholders initiated the Georgia litigation to try to protect the value of their shares and were required to enter into settlement negotiations with CompuCredit, portions of which are now a part of the allegations of conspiracy in the Minnesota litigation. (Id. ¶78-79.)
DISCUSSION
"[A] district court should . . . consider[] abstaining from exercising jurisdiction in [a] case where a parallel . . . lawsuit is pending. Th[e] court may raise the issue of the appropriateness of abstention sua sponte." Cincinnati Indem. Co. v. A & K Const. Co., 542 F.3d 623, 624-25 (8th Cir. 2008) (discussing abstention in a case involving parallel federal and state claims) (internal citations omitted). Courts in other jurisdictions have similarly noted that federal courts should avoid duplicitous litigation ongoing in other federal courts, particularly when potentially compulsory counterclaims are involved. Nat'l Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Fowler, 287 F.2d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 1961).
Further, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a),1 the general transfer provision, provides: "For the convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought." In analyzing a motion to transfer under § 1404(a), a district court employs a three-factor balancing test that considers "(1) the convenience of the parties, (2) the convenience of the witnesses, and (3) the interests of justice." Terra Int'l Inc. v. Miss. Chem. Corp., 119 F.3d 688, 691 (8th Cir. 1997). These factors are not exclusive, and a district court's decision on a motion to transfer "require[s] a case-by-case evaluation of the particular circumstances at hand and a consideration of all relevant factors." Id. Ultimately, a district court enjoys "much discretion" when deciding whether to grant a motion to transfer. Id. at 697. See also Cent. Reg'l Emps. Benefit Fund v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., No. 09-2125, 2010 WL 3515693, at *1 (D. Minn. Aug. 21, 2010).
In the instant case, the Court finds that the relevant factors to the decision to transfer venue are whether the issues raised in the Minnesota litigation could be considered compulsory counterclaims and whether the Colorado River doctrine of abstention is implicated.
I. Venue Considerations
In the Georgia litigation, the Court found that venue transfer was warranted primarily for the expense and convenience of the parties. Regarding the first factor of the balancing test, the Court noted that all of the parties are corporations, more than two-thirds of whom have no ties to Minnesota at all. Hr'g on Mot. to Change Venue at 34:19-20 (Docket No. 81), Akanthos Capital Mgmt., LLC et al., No. 09-cv-3664 (D. Minn. Mar. 19, 2010). Further, Noteholders claimed CompuCredit was insolvent, so the Court found that none of the parties would be served by the increased expense of litigating in Minnesota as opposed to Georgia, where CompuCredit is located. Id. at 34:15-20. Regarding the second factor, the Court also noted that the primary witnesses in the case were located in Georgia and that no fact witnesses were located in Minnesota. Id. at 35:18-36:6.
Finally, on the third factor, the Court noted the considerations for evaluating the interests of justice are "the relative familiarity of the two courts with the law to be applied, the relative ability of the parties to bear the expenses of litigating in a distant forum, judicial economy, the plaintiff's choice of forum, obstacles to a fair trial, and each party's ability to enforce a judgment." Id. at 36:7-17 (citing Graff v. Qwest Commc'ns Corp., 33 F.Supp.2d 1117, 1122 (D. Minn. 1999)). The Court determined the last consideration was not relevant and the others either carried no weight or were equally balanced, with the exception of the ability to bear the costs of the litigation. Id. at 36:18-39:4. Again, the Court cited CompuCredit's potential insolvency as determinative on this point. Id.
The Court finds that the earlier determination on these three factors is applicable to the instant litigation since the parties are the same and the issues to be litigated revolve around the same factual scenarios. The Court notes that the instant litigation presents further issues related to judicial economy and the interests of justice that support a transfer of venue that were not present in the Georgia litigation: the potential of compulsory counterclaims and Colorado River concerns of duplicative litigation.
II. Compulsory Counterclaims
While a claim that could be a compulsory counterclaim in a different litigation does not necessarily make venue improper, courts have noted that when "[t]here undoubtedly are judicial economy and preclusion issues involved . . . the availability of a counterclaim in [another court] is a factor to consider in determining whether to transfer the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)." Jomico, LLC v. Traxys N. Am., LLC, No. 09-342, 2010 WL 2640100, at *4 (E.D. Okla. June 29, 2010) (emphasis omitted). Without determining precisely if claims were compulsory counterclaims, other courts have transferred cases to districts with pending litigation in part because "[e]ven if the cases are not ultimately consolidated, having the matters resolved in the same forum will increase the probability of consistent results." Neb. Beef, Ltd. v. Advanced Food Co., Inc., No. 8:09CV107, 2009 WL 2225816, at *3 (D. Neb. July 17, 2009); see also Avaya, Inc. v. Mitel Networks Corp., 460 F.Supp.2d 690, 692 (E.D. Va. 2006).
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure state:
A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that — at the time of its service — the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim:
(A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim; and
(B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a)(1).
The allegations in the Minnesota litigation are factually intertwined with the claims asserted in the Georgia litigation. Indeed, one portion of the instant motion concerns settlement negotiations that occurred in the Georgia litigation prior to the venue transfer. The Eighth Circuit applies the "logical relation test" to determine if a counterclaim is mandatory. Tullos v. Parks, 915 F.2d 1192, 1195 (8th Cir. 1990). Under that test, compulsory counterclaims "may comprehend a series of many occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship." Id. (citing Moore v. N. Y. Cotton Exch., 270 U.S. 593, 610 (1926)).
Under this test, the allegations in this complaint are logically related to those in the Georgia litigation since they are the reactions of two parties to each other's actions around the sale of the notes at issue. In this manner, the two lawsuits are intrinsically intertwined. The Court declines to determine whether the claims in the Minnesota litigation are actually compulsory counterclaims — this determination properly belongs with the court hearing the underlying claims. However, the Court finds that the probability that the Minnesota claims are compulsory in the Georgia litigation weighs in favor of transferring venue in the interests of justice.
III. Colorado River
The Supreme Court has noted that when an action in federal court is closely related to an action already pending in state court, prudential factors should be considered when deciding whether to exercise federal jurisdiction. Colo. River, 424 U.S. at 817-20. The principle of avoiding duplicative litigation is even stronger with regard to parallel proceedings in two federal courts. Id. at 817; see also Mo. ex rel. Nixon, 259 F.3d at 952-53. When faced with duplicative litigation, a court has at its disposal a "variety of mechanisms . . . to deal with this issue [such as] venue transfer . . . ." Mastro v. Momot, No. 09-01076, 2009 WL 1993772, at *2 (D. Ariz. July 9, 2009); see also Haworth, Inc. v. Herman Miller, Inc., 821 F.Supp. 1476, 1482 (N.D. Ga. 1992) ("Where exceptional circumstances, grounded on considerations of wise judicial administration, giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation, exist, a district court may decline to review a case where proper jurisdiction exists or transfer the case to a more appropriate venue." (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 817)). Given identical parties and the similarity of issues presented in the instant case, the Court finds that the Colorado River principle of avoiding duplicative litigation is a relevant factor in the interests of justice weighing in favor of venue transfer.
In sum, the Court determines that the convenience of the parties and witnesses weighs in favor of venue transfer. Further, for the interests of justice, the purpose of judicial economy, and to avoid potentially duplicitous proceedings with contradictory outcomes, the Court transfers venue for the instant case to United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia through its discretionary power under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).
ORDER
Based on the above considerations, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this case is transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.


FootNotes 
1. Under Section 1404(a), a court must first determine whether the action "might have been brought" in the proposed transferee district. However, given that the Minnesota District Court previously reached this conclusion with regard to the same parties and over intrinsically similar factual allegations, this Court does not repeat this analysis. Hr'g on Mot. to Change Venue, Akanthos Capital Mgmt., LLC et al., Case No. 09-cv-3664 (D. Minn. Mar. 19, 2010).

CelestialRX Investments, LLC.v. Krivulka

Annotate this Case





Justia Opinion Summary


				A 16-count complaint alleged conspiracy to funnel valuable pharmaceutical interests away from an entity in which the Plaintiff, CelestialRX, LLC, is a member.  The claims include allegedly improper self-dealing by two members of a three-member LLC. On motions to dismiss and for summary judgment, the Delaware Chancery Court rejected a claim that plaintiffs had contractually released certain claims and analyzed the LLC agreement to conclude that good faith—a subjective standard, applies separately to both the transaction and to the conflicted party’s analysis of whether it is “fair and reasonable,” but must be read consistently with the purpose of specific standards, which is to permit conflicted transactions in certain circumstances. The court urged the parties to mediate the dispute.

Choa, of POTTER ANDERSON & CORROON LLP, Wilmington, Delaware, Attorneys for Defendant Akrimax Pharmaceuticals LLC. GLASSCOCK, Vice Chancellor This procedurally awkward and factually prolix Memorandum Opinion reserves outstanding Motions to Dismiss, in favor of consideration of Motions for Partial Summary Judgment, which appeared to offer low-hanging fruit which, if reaped at the outset, might avoid significant litigation effort. The two issues so addressed involve the standard of care in the governing limited liability company agreement, and the effect of a release agreement, entered by the principal of the main plaintiff here, on that entity’s ability to proceed with its claims. Plucking that fruit has proved more difficult than I anticipated, and whether its elimination from the menu of this litigation will shorten the meal remains to be seen. With these issues resolved, at any rate, I encourage the parties to mediate this dispute, litigation of which will no doubt involve much more unpalatable effort. This action arises out of an alleged conspiracy to funnel valuable pharmaceutical interests away from an entity in which the Plaintiff, CelestialRX, LLC (“CelestialRX”), is a member. The operative amended complaint brings sixteen different counts against over a dozen Defendants. The numerous Defendants have banded together into five groups; each group has moved to dismiss this action. Two groups have moved for partial summary judgment. The parties have identified two preliminary issues which, if decided, could significantly clarify the legal issues in this action. The first is whether a July 1, 2013 release (the “Release Agreement”) bars causes of action brought by CelestialRX that accrued prior to the release. The 1 second is the extent to which the limited liability company agreement (the “LLC Agreement”) and a July 1, 2013 amendment to that agreement (“Amendment No. 7”) limit or modify fiduciary duties. This Memorandum Opinion addresses those preliminary issues. Because these two preliminary issues were raised by Defendants’ Motions for Partial Summary Judgment, I will address them under that standard. I am reserving decision on the outstanding Motions to Dismiss and will ask for further guidance from the parties in light of my decisions below on these two preliminary legal issues. I undertake this unusual procedure in the interest of efficiency. I. BACKGROUND1 This action involves a tangled web of pharmaceutical transactions, licensing, and sales agreements among various related entities. Thus this case’s background is dense. The following provides a detailed but non-exhaustive overview of the context of this dispute sufficient to understand this Court’s analysis of the two legal issues addressed: interpretation of the July 1, 2013 Release Agreement, and interpretation of certain duty-related provisions in the LLC Agreement and Amendment No. 7. A heavier focus is given to the pre-July 1, 2013 events as such context is helpful to understand the documents executed that day. There are substantial disputes in this 1 Except where otherwise noted, the information in this section is undisputed and taken from the verified pleadings, affidavits, and other evidence submitted to the Court. Reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the non-moving party—the Plaintiffs here. 2 litigation arising after July 1, 2013; because of the nature of this Memorandum Opinion, those are discussed with less detail. The casual reader may be satisfied with the brief summary, below. This action arises from allegedly improper self-dealing transactions by two members of a three-member limited liability company. The company, Akrimax Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Akrimax” or the “Company”), is a Defendant in this action along with the two alleged wrong-doers—Joseph J. Krivulka and Leonard Mazur. The third member of Akrimax is itself a limited liability company, and brings this action challenging such transactions on various grounds. That third member, Plaintiff CelestialRX, is wholly owned by a non-party, Steve Laumas. Akrimax is a pharmaceutical business and engaged in a morass of licensing and sales agreements underlying this dispute. The Plaintiffs allege that Krivulka improperly inserted various entities that he controlled or was invested in (the “Middlemen Entities”) as middlemen between Akrimax and other drug companies from whom Akrimax sought to receive drug rights. The Middlemen Entities received a cut of the sales or marketing performed by Akrimax. The favorability of the terms under which the Middlemen Entities were interposed between the company and third parties is heavily disputed. In the Spring of 2013 Krivulka and his entities notified Akrimax of their intention to terminate Akrimax’s rights to sell and distribute certain drugs. 3 Allegedly, this was the first time CelestialRX and Laumas learned of the Middlemen Entities’ existence and dealings with Akrimax, and Laumas thereafter began investigating—and disputing the propriety of—Krivulka’s actions. Ultimately a “settlement” was reached whereby the Middlemen Entities agreed that Akrimax would retain certain drug rights in exchange for paying additional fees, among other concessions. In connection with the settlement, Laumas (but, according to the Plaintiffs, not CelestialRX) released all claims against Krivulka and Mazur. These higher fees ultimately were not paid, allegedly as part of a scheme by Krivulka to damage Akrimax, and Akrimax eventually lost the rights returned to it via the settlement. CelestialRX brings this action alleging misconduct by Krivulka and others for almost every transaction between Krivulka’s related entities and Akrimax. A. Parties 1. The Plaintiffs Plaintiff CelestialRX is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal place of business in Old Greenwich, Connecticut.2 CelestialRX’s sole member and manager is Sandeep “Steve” Laumas (“Laumas”).3 The Plaintiff, CelestialRX, is a member of the Defendant, Akrimax.4 Transmittal Aff. of Michael D.

Defendant Groups Given the number of Defendants in this litigation, it is helpful to note that the Defendants have formed the five groups discussed below. The first group of Defendants is the “Krivulka Defendants” which consists of the following: Joseph Krivulka, JJK Partners, JAK Investment Partners, Mist Acquisition, Mist Pharmaceuticals, Mist Partners, Cranford Therapeutics and Holmdel Therapeutics. The Krivulka Defendants have moved to dismiss each count against them, and for partial summary judgment on each of the two preliminary issues. The next group of Defendants, the “Mazur Defendants,” consists of Defendants Leonard Mazur and LMazur. The Mazur Defendants have moved to dismiss each count against them for lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, and for partial summary judgment regarding the preliminary issue of the effect of the July 1, 2013 release. Defendant Olsen is on his own, and has moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. Similarly, Defendant Holmdel Pharmaceuticals is on its own, and has moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Finally, Cranford Pharmaceuticals is on its own and has moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim. 12 B. Akrimax’s Beginnings and Select Transactions53 Akrimax was formed by Krivulka and Mazur on October 24, 2007.54 There was no initial capital contribution by Krivulka or Mazur.55 On January 11, 2008, Akrimax amended its governing documents to permit an investment by a hedge fund, North Sound Capital.56 Laumas previously worked at North Sound Capital, however at the time of North Sound’s investment he was no longer at the hedge fund.57 North Sound invested $35 million and received 35,000,000 non-voting, Class A preferred units.58 The record indicates that in connection with this investment, which Laumas was involved in facilitating, CelestialRX, Laumas’ entity, received 49% of Akrimax’s common voting units.59 Thus the common voting units, as outlined in Figure 1, were initially distributed as follows, 49% to CelestialRX, 25.5% to Mazur, and 25.5% to Krivulka.60 These voting shares appear to have been received without capital contribution, and the initial capital came from North Sound.61 53 I note other transactions involving the drugs InnoPran XL and Suprenza, for example, occurred between formation and July 1, 2013 and were mentioned in the briefing. However, because they were not heavily emphasized I chose to omit them from this background section for efficiency. 54 Zahler Aff. Ex. 2 at Recitals. 55 See id. at Ex. A. 56 See Eakins Aff.

Rouses Point and Inderal Also on January 11, 2008, Akrimax purchased a manufacturing facility in Rouses Point, New York from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for $20 million.66 As part of a separate agreement executed the same day Akrimax purchased rights to Inderal and certain other drugs for $12 million from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.67 Thus Akrimax’s early productive assets were the facility and the drug rights purchased from Wyeth. Later that year, Rouses Point Pharmaceuticals (“RPP”) was formed.68 Krivulka and Mazur collectively hold a controlling interest in RPP.69 Akrimax 62 Eakins Aff. Ex. 2. § 4.01(b).

NitroMist On October 27, 2009 Mist Acquisition entered into a transaction with a third party, NovaDel Pharma Inc. (“NovaDel”) to acquire the rights to the drug NitroMist via a License and Distribution Agreement.71 To secure the rights, Mist Acquisition agreed to pay NovaDel an up-front fee of $1 million, milestone payments, and performance payments.72 Two days later, on October 29, 2009, Mist Acquisition entered into a Commercialization, Distribution, and Support Services Agreement with Akrimax (the “NitroMist Services Agreement”).73 Via the NitroMist Services Agreement, Akrimax was assigned Mist Acquisition’s right to distribute NitroMist in exchange for Akrimax assuming the responsibilities of the October 27, 2009 License Agreement, excluding the $1 million up-front payment in the License Agreement,74 and agreeing to pay Mist Acquisition a royalty on net sales.75 Thus Akrimax was able to receive the rights, without the substantial upfront payment; however, if certain milestones were met, deferred payments totaling $1 million 70 Zahler Aff. Ex. 29 at 33–34. Rouses Point Pharmaceuticals, as a result of the agreement, was responsible for paying Akrimax a service fee of 60% of Propranolol ER’s gross profit. Id.

Tirosint On January 27, 2010 Akrimax entered into a Promotion Agreement (the “Tirosint Agreement”) with Alpharma Pharmaceuticals, LLC to market and distribute the drug Tirosint.78 The Tirosint Agreement provided Akrimax and its affiliates an exclusive right to promote, market, sell and distribute Tirosint.79 The Tirosint Agreement required Akrimax to expend millions per year on product promotion,80 and required certain minimum product purchases per year. 81 That same day, January 27, 2010, Akrimax assigned to Mist Acquisition all of its “rights and obligations” under the Tirosint Agreement.82 From the record developed at this point, it appears at the time of this transfer, there was no consideration rendered by Mist Acquisition other than assuming Akrimax’s obligations under the Tirosint Agreement.83 76 Id. at § 4.4.

C at 91:3–11 (Mazur). 77 16 On December 7, 2011, Mist Acquisition entered into a Promotion, Distribution and Support Services Agreement (the “Tirosint Services Agreement”) with Akrimax.84 Pursuant to this agreement Akrimax would retain 90% of Tirosint’s sales and would pay a 10% royalty to Mist Acquisition.85 Further, the Tirosint Services Agreement was backdated to be effective as of January 27, 2010.86 The Tirosint Services Agreement required the 10% royalty rate to be paid on accrued distributions since the promotion commencement date.87 The favorability of these terms is disputed—the Krivulka Defendants argue the transfer occurred after Tirosint’s launch, which presumably required some expenditure by Mist, and that the terms were favorable given Mist Acquisitions’ “substantial assumption of obligations.”88 The Plaintiffs, for their part, assert that the transactions were “purposeless” and that “[b]ut for these purposeless transactions, Akrimax would have retained 100% of . . . gross sales.”89 d. Primlev On October 3, 2011, Mist Pharmaceuticals entered into a Marketing Rights Agreement (the “Primlev Agreement”) with unrelated third-parties Argent Development Group and Mikart, Inc. to acquire distribution rights for the drug 84 Eakins Aff.

The Plaintiffs assert Mist Pharmaceuticals is an unnecessary “middle man,”97 whereas the Krivulka Defendants assert Akrimax did not have the resources to expend upfront and the 90 Eakins Aff. Ex. 16.

The Settlement with Pfizer In 2011 and 2012, an ongoing dispute between Akrimax and Pfizer was settled.99 Pfizer had acquired Wyeth after Wyeth’s January 11, 2008 transaction with Akrimax for the Rouses Point manufacturing facility and various drug rights, including Inderal. Pfizer alleged that Akrimax had failed to comply with its obligations arising from the January 2008 transactions.100 Laumas voted in favor of the settlement with Pfizer.101 Mazur also voted in favor of the settlement over Krivulka’s objection.102 The settlement had two different agreements. The first was the Settlement Agreement entered on June 27, 2011.103 The Settlement Agreement required Akrimax to return the Rouses Point manufacturing facility to Pfizer, along with the rights to Inderal and the other pharmaceutical products.104 In exchange Pfizer released Akrimax of certain obligations—appearing to total upwards of $20 Krivulka Defs’ Opening Br. 16.

Ex. 13. 104 Id. at Recitals, §§ 1.47, 1.94, 2.2. 98 99 19 million.105 That same day Pfizer and Akrimax entered into a License and Option Agreement.106 The License and Option Agreement permitted Akrimax to continue its sales of both Inderal and its generic version Propranolol ER, 107 and provided Akrimax the option to reacquire certain rights for $45,000,000.108 Thus, over Krivulka’s objection, Laumas and Mazur voted to return the Inderal rights and the Rouses Point manufacturing facility to Pfizer.109 Each side has a different theory regarding the effect of this vote. The Plaintiffs assert that this dispute between Mazur, Laumas, and Krivulka angered Krivulka; it motived him to, in bad faith, “exact revenge upon his partners” and Akrimax. 110 The Krivulka Defendants’ spin on the vote is that it fundamentally changed Akrimax as a company. The Defendants argue Akrimax “transitioned from an entity receiving revenues based on manufacturing” and revenue streams from its initial Inderal purchase in 2008, “to an entity earning revenues marketing and selling pharmaceuticals under rights acquired by other entities.”111 See id. at § 2.2; Krivulka Defs’ Opening Br. 15 (“Pfizer released Akrimax’s obligations of approximately $20 million.”). 106 Eakins Aff.

Spring 2013—Certain Akrimax Rights Are Terminated On April 12, 2013 a series of letters were sent providing Akrimax notice that its rights to Primlev, NitroMist, and Tirosint, were being terminated effective June 1, 2013, pursuant to the “for convenience” provisions described above.118 Specifically, Mist Pharmaceuticals, via letter over Krivulka’s signature, informed Akrimax that the Primlev Services Agreement was terminated.119 Mist Acquisition, via letters over Krivulka’s signature, terminated the NitroMist Services Agreement and the Tirosint Services Agreement.120 Following these termination letters, Laumas began requesting information from Akrimax.121 Through the termination letters Laumas learned, purportedly for the first time, of the Mist entities’ involvement with Akrimax.122 On May 7, 2013 Laumas sent a flurry of emails requesting information from Akrimax.123 On the evening of May 7, 2013, Laumas also sent Krivulka and Mazur a consolidated list of eighteen categories of documents he was requesting, which included account balances, employee credit card statements, and legal invoices.124 118 See Zahler Aff.

The July 1, 2013 “Settlement” 1. The Lead Up The record reflects that on May 28, 2013, Mazur and Laumas, over Krivulka’s objection,128 voted to retain Reitler Kailas & Rosenblatt LLC (“Reitler”) on behalf of the Akrimax board of directors.129 A complaint was drafted by Reitler, dated May 29, 2013, with Akrimax as the plaintiff and Krivulka, Mist Pharmaceuticals, and Mist Acquisition as the defendants.130 Laumas worked together with Mazur in preparing the complaint, but it was not filed.131 The draft complaint alleged several counts including conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty, and fraud.132 The counts in the draft complaint arose out of many 125 Eakins Aff.

However, on June 5, 2013, Mist Pharmaceuticals and Mist Acquisition agreed to forbear the respective termination notices until the end of the month.139 The stated purpose of the forbearance was to give the Mist Entities and 133 See id. at ¶¶ 22–51.

Ex. 52. 134 24 Akrimax the opportunity to negotiate “a mutually agreeable resolution of the disputes among the Parties.”140 The agreement was signed by Krivulka on behalf of the Mist entities and by Mazur and Laumas on behalf of Akrimax.141 During the forbearance period, Akrimax agreed to not seek additional documentation from a particular law firm, or to “seek any discovery.”142 On June 10, 2013, Krivulka circulated an email titled “Issues to discuss.”143 Among other things, the email proposed that Mazur and Laumas choose between (1) paying a 30% royalty on drugs coming back into Akrimax, and keeping a 49% equity stake in Akrimax, or (2) paying a 20% royalty and keeping a 24.5% equity stake in Akrimax.144 Krivulka’s terms also provided that “Steven Laumas and Leonard Mazur will release any and all parties without prejudice,” and that Krivulka would have the final decision over the sale of any company assets.145 On June 14, 2013 Laumas circulated a new term sheet to Krivulka and Mazur.146 The royalty rates Laumas selected to be paid by Akrimax remained at 30%—the same as his June 3, 2013 proposal.147 Laumas stated the “Members of Akrimax consist of Joseph Krivulka (‘Krivulka’), Leonard Mazur (‘Mazur’) and 140 Id.

On June 18, 2013, Krivulka indicated via e-mail to Laumas that “the process needs to move.”151 The next day, Krivulka emailed Laumas “Tick Tock. Tick Tock.”152 The negotiation process continued—by June 25, 2013, the draft Amendment No. 7 circulated by Krivulka indicated that Krivulka would be the “Manager” of Akrimax, and that he would have “full, exclusive and complete discretion” to manage the company subject to the “input” of the Board.153 Following this draft, Laumas requested a few changes which Krivulka rejected on June 28, 2013.154 That same day, Krivulka pushed for final execution copies of the various 148 Id. Id. 150 Id. 151 Zahler Aff. Ex. 53. 152 Id. 153 Zahler Aff. Ex. 55. 154 Zahler Aff. Ex. 56. 149 26 agreements155 and rejected Laumas’ pushback about how a company airplane was being handled in the settlement.156 Ultimately several agreements were executed on July 1, 2013. The Plaintiffs assert the agreements were fraudulently induced via Krivulka’s representations that he would use his best efforts to ensure that the royalties owed to Mist and other entities were not defaulted on so that the products did not “snap back” or revert out of Akrimax.157 Similarly, the Plaintiffs assert that Krivulka represented that he would leverage Akrimax to help it acquire new products, and acquire additional licenses.158 The Plaintiffs argue these were fraudulent representations that induced Laumas to enter the settlement.159 2. The Agreements Over a dozen documents were executed on July 1, 2013.160 Two of those documents are the focus of this Memorandum Opinion—the Release Agreement and Amendment No. 7’s fiduciary duty standard. Because a close discussion of those documents’ text is necessary to this opinion they are addressed in detail infra. 155 Zahler Aff. Ex. 57. Zahler Aff. Ex. 58. 157 Zahler Aff. Ex. 62 Response No. 8. 158 Id. 159 Id.; Pls’ Answering Br. in Opposition to Krivulka Defs’ Motions 28–29. 160 Compl. ¶ 73 (stating the agreement “comprised of some fourteen separate documents”); Pls’ Answering Br. in Opposition to Krivulka Defs’ Motions 28 (indicating there were sixteen documents executed). 156 27 However, a brief overview of the settlement is helpful to understanding the two particular documents at issue here. I note that certain agreements, including Amendment No. 7, were incorporated into a unanimous written consent of Akrimax’s Board, signed by Laumas, Krivulka and Mazur, indicating that the agreements were “advisable and in the best interest” of Akrimax.161 The Release Agreement was not included in the unanimous written consent.162 In sum, the agreements called for certain drug rights to be put back into Akrimax, or to undo the cancellation of certain rights, in exchange for a revamped ownership structure, with Krivulka’s ownership and management power increasing, and Akrimax paying higher royalty rates on the products returned to Akrimax. One of the July 1, 2013 agreements, the Tirosint “Termination and Royalty Agreement,”163 provided that Akrimax would terminate the earlier assignment to Mist Pharmaceuticals of its rights to Tirosint.164 The drug was returned to Akrimax, in exchange for Akrimax paying a 35% royalty on gross sales.165 However, if Akrimax failed to pay these royalties, upon 45 days’ notice Mist Acquisition could retake the rights to Tirosint.166 Similar agreements were signed for NitroMist and 161 See Eakins Aff. Ex. 44. See id. 163 See Eakins Aff. Ex. 46. 164 See id. at Recitals. 165 Id. at § 2.1 166 Id. at §§ 3.1, 3.5. 162 28 Primlev.167 Each permitted Akrimax to continue distributing those drugs at a royalty rate of 30% of net sales.168 There was some give and some get from both sides of the July 1, 2013 agreements. For example, a portion of the July 1, 2013 settlement required Laumas’ consulting entity, Krittika, to have its consulting fees or board fees paid off the top of Akrimax’s payment waterfall.169 However, in exchange for having certain drug rights put back into Akrimax and increasing his payment priority, Laumas made several concessions including: allowing Krivulka’s stake in Akrimax to increase and his to decrease,170 requiring Akrimax to pay higher royalty rates on drugs put back into Akrimax, Krivulka becoming Akrimax’s Manager, and Laumas and Mazur forfeiting their seats on Akrimax’s board.171 Further, as part of the transaction, Laumas executed a Release Agreement releasing certain claims arising prior to the settlement.172 G. Post July 1, 2013 Settlement While post July-2013 events are not essential to this partial summary judgment opinion, I note a number of the issues contested in this litigation occurred in this time frame. However, because this decision only addresses the legal question 167 See Eakins Aff. Exs. 47, 49. See Eakins Aff. Exs. 47 at §4.1, 49 at ¶ 4. 169 Eakins Aff. Ex. 45 ¶ 10. 170 See id. at Ex. A. 171 See id. at ¶ 6. 172 See Eakins Aff. Ex 51. 168 29 of what standard of care applied after July 1, 2013, a detailed discussion of those events is not necessary here. It is sufficient to state that after the settlement, Krivulka continued certain investment activities outside of Akrimax, including in, for example, Cranford Therapeutics. Additionally, Akrimax defaulted on several of the royalty payments it was obligated to make on drugs involved in the settlement in late 2013 and early 2014.173 Krivulka ultimately loaned Akrimax $1.3 million in March 2014,174 allegedly due to its low cash balance. The parties heavily dispute why cash balances were low, why defaults occurred, and whether the payment waterfall was properly complied with. It is Plaintiffs’ position that Krivulka “engineered” a default, under which Akrimax’s rights to drugs reverted out of the company to Krivulka related entities.175 H. Procedural History Plaintiff CelestialRX filed a verified complaint on November 20, 2015 pleading twelve counts. A TRO hearing was held on November 24, 2015, and this Court subsequently entered an order granting the TRO on December 3, 2015. The parties then engaged in expedited discovery and on February 8, 2016, this Court heard argument on CelestialRX’s motion for a preliminary injunction. 173 See Compl. ¶¶ 107–08; Eakins Aff. Ex. 66.

Ex. 65. 175 Pls’ Answering Br. in Opposition to Krivulka Defs’ Motions 46 (arguing “[i]t is clear Krivulka engineered the default”). 174 30 CelestialRX’s request for a preliminary injunction was denied and I indicated to the parties that, moving forward, two legal issues will need to be decided: first, the effect, if any, of the July 1, 2013 Release Agreement, and second, the duties owed under the LLC Agreement.176 An Amended Complaint (the “Complaint”) was filed on March 8, 2016.177 The Complaint added several new parties—including a new Plaintiff, Krittika—as well as four new counts. Further, it added the following Defendants: Donald Olsen, JAK Investment Partners, Cranford Pharmaceuticals, Cranford Therapeutics, Holmdel Pharmaceuticals, and Holmdel Therapeutics. On April 14, 2016, the Court granted a stipulated order governing the proceedings on the two preliminary issues addressed in this Memorandum Opinion.178 That order permitted discovery to be taken on the two preliminary issues of the effect of the July 1, 2013 Release Agreement, and the duties provided by the LLC Agreement.179 Each Defendant has moved to dismiss this action on various grounds, including failure to state a claim, and lack of jurisdiction. I am reserving on those motions. 176 See Feb. 8, 2016 Oral Arg. Tr. 76:6–77:2. See Zahler Aff. Ex. 1. 178 April 14, 2016 Scheduling Order for Proceedings Regarding Preliminary Issues. 179 Id. at 3–4. 177 31 On July 19, 2016, the Krivulka Defendants moved for partial summary judgment on the following two issues: (i) [whether] CelestialRX Investments, LLC’s claims relating to or arising from actions through and including July 1, 2013 [should be] barred and dismissed with prejudice, including entry of judgment against Plaintiffs on Count VIII [, the fraudulent inducement count,] of Plaintiffs’ First Amended Verified Complaint (ii) [whether] Akrimax Pharmaceuticals, LLC’s Second and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement and the Seventh Amendment thereof (collectively, the ‘LLC Agreement’) eliminated fiduciary duties and Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of the LLC Agreement provide the applicable contractual burden of proof and/or persuasion for conflict transactions.180 The Mazur Defendants also moved for partial summary judgment on July 19, 2016 for the grounds set forth in its briefing.181 In briefing, the Mazur Defendants seek partial summary judgment on the issue of the July 1, 2013 Release Agreement.182 Oral argument was held October 17, 2016 on all motions, however, the majority of the hearing focused on these two preliminary issues.183 This Memorandum Opinion addresses Defendants’ Motions for Partial Summary Judgment. II. STANDARD OF REVIEW As discussed above, this Memorandum Opinion addresses two preliminary issues raised by the partial summary judgment motions. The parties submit, and I Krivulka Defs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. See Mazur Defs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. 182 See Mazur Defs’ Opening Br. 15–17. 183 See Oct. 17, 2016 Oral Arg. Tr. 7–51, 74–117, 160–163. 180 181 32 agree, that a decision on these two issues could clarify the issues in this litigation. Thus I apply the traditional summary judgment analysis to these two issues, reserving decision on the remaining case-dispositive motions. This Court may enter summary judgment when the record demonstrates that “there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”184 The summary judgment standard puts the initial burden on the moving party to demonstrate the “absence of a material factual dispute.”185 If the moving party satisfies its initial burden then “the burden shifts to the nonmovant to present some specific, admissible evidence that there is a genuine issue of fact for a trial.”186 At this point, the nonmoving party may not simply rest on their pleadings, but must point to conflicting evidence in the record that creates a genuine dispute of material fact. In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the facts and reasonable inferences drawn therefrom “must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.”187 However, the Court “will not, draw unreasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.”188 184 Del.

ANALYSIS In analyzing the Defendants’ Motions for Partial Summary Judgment, each of which requires me to construe a contract, I am guided by our case law discussing when summary judgment is appropriate in such a context. Generally, “[w]hen the issue before the Court involves the interpretation of a contract, summary judgment is appropriate only if the contract in question is unambiguous.” 189 Our Supreme Court has explained that [t]his Court has long upheld awards of summary judgment in contract disputes where the language at issue is clear and unambiguous. In such cases, the parol evidence rule bars the admission of evidence from outside the contract's four corners to vary or contradict that unambiguous language. But, where reasonable minds could differ as to the contract's meaning, a factual dispute results and the fact-finder must consider admissible extrinsic evidence. In those cases, summary judgment is improper.190 Specifically, the Supreme Court has indicated that “in a dispute over the proper interpretation of a contract, summary judgment may not be awarded if the language is ambiguous and the moving party has failed to offer uncontested evidence as to the proper interpretation.”191 I note this same standard applies to the construction of a 189 United Rentals, Inc. v. RAM Holdings, Inc., 937 A.2d 810, 830 (Del. Ch. 2007). GMG Capital Investments, LLC v. Athenian Venture Partners I, L.P., 36 A.3d 776, 783 (Del. 2012) (citations omitted). 191 Id. at 784. 190 34 LLC agreement.192 Thus my analysis in interpreting the Release Agreement and the fiduciary standard set by the LLC Agreement will proceed in light of this standard. A. The Release Agreement The Defendants seek partial summary judgment that the Plaintiff, CelestialRX, has released all claims existing as of the date of execution of the Release Agreement. The Defendants argue that the Release Agreement, signed by Laumas individually, “is general and broad in scope” and released claims pre-dating July 1, 2013, including a count for fraudulent inducement now brought in the present action by Laumas’ wholly owned entity CelestialRX.193 The Plaintiffs argue that the Release Agreement is clear that only Laumas’ individual claims were released, and that CelestialRX and Krittika were not parties to the agreement and thus it is not enforceable against them. Further, the Plaintiffs allege the agreement was fraudulently induced and therefore not enforceable under New York law. Because In re NextMedia Inv'rs, LLC, 2009 WL 1228665, at *3 (Del. Ch. May 6, 2009) (“In a dispute requiring interpretation of a contract, summary judgment is appropriate only where the contract is unambiguous. Ambiguity exists when the provisions in controversy are reasonably or fairly susceptible of different interpretations or may have two or more different meanings. In other words, to succeed on their motion for summary judgment, the petitioners must demonstrate that their interpretation of the LLC Agreement is the only reasonable one.”) (citations and internal quotations omitted). See Matthew v. Laudamiel, 2012 WL 2580572, at *5 (Del. Ch. June 29, 2012) (applying traditional contract standard in reviewing motion for summary judgment when interpreting an LLC agreement). 193 Krivulka Defs’ Opening Br. 37. 192 35 New York law governs this document, I first review that law and then apply it to the terms of the Release Agreement.194 1. New York Contract Law New York law provides that the “fundamental, neutral precept of contract interpretation is that agreements are construed in accord with the parties' intent[, and that t]he best evidence of what parties to a written agreement intend is what they say in their writing.”195 “Thus, a written agreement that is complete, clear and unambiguous on its face must be enforced according to the plain meaning of its terms.”196 Under New York law, “[a]mbiguity in a contract arises when the contract, read as a whole, fails to disclose its purpose and the parties' intent . . . , or when specific language is susceptible of two reasonable interpretations.”197 Courts applying New York law have recognized that “[a] contract is ambiguous when it could suggest multiple meanings to a reasonable, objective reader familiar with the context of the contract . . . the Court should take into account both the language of the contract and the inferences that can be drawn from that language.”198 Similarly, 194 Eakins Aff. Ex. 51 § 12. Innophos, Inc. v. Rhodia, S.A., 10 N.Y.3d 25, 29 (N.Y. 2008) (quoting Greenfield v. Philles Records, Inc., 98 N.Y.2d 562, 569 (N.Y. 2002)) (alterations provided by New York Court of Appeals in Rhodia). 196 Greenfield, 98 N.Y.2d at 569 (citations omitted). 197 Ellington v. EMI Music, Inc., 24 N.Y.3d 239, 244 (N.Y. 2014) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 198 Kobrand Corp. v. Abadia Retuerta S.A., 2012 WL 5851139, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 19, 2012) (citations omitted). 195 36 New York law recognizes that a “contract should not be interpreted to produce a result that is absurd, commercially unreasonable or contrary to the reasonable expectations of the parties.”199 However, “[e]xtrinsic evidence of the parties' intent may be considered only if the agreement is ambiguous, which is an issue of law for the courts to decide.”200 In Broyhill Furniture Industries, Inc. v. Hudson Furniture Galleries, LLC,201 the New York Appellate Division explained interpretation of a release under New York law as follows: [a]s with contracts generally, the courts must look to the language of a release—the words used by the parties—to determine their intent, resorting to extrinsic evidence only when the court concludes as a matter of law that the contract is ambiguous. . . . The scope of a general release depends on the controversy being settled and the purpose for which the release is actually given . . . . However, if from the recitals therein or otherwise, it appears that the release is to be limited to only particular claims, demands or obligations, the instrument will be operative as to those matters alone.202 Regarding introductory portions of a contract, New York law recognizes that “[a]lthough a statement in a ‘whereas’ clause may be useful in interpreting an 199 Greenwich Capital Fin. Prod., Inc. v. Negrin, 903 N.Y.S.2d 346, 348 (N.Y. App. Div. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 200 Rhodia, S.A., 10 N.Y.3d at 29 (citation omitted). 201 Broyhill Furniture Indus., Inc. v. Hudson Furniture Galleries, LLC 877 N.Y.S.2d 72 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009). 202 Id. at 74 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis added); See Consol. Edison, Inc. v. Northeast Utilities, 332 F.Supp. 2d 639, 647 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (applying New York law and observing “it is well established that the scope of a release turns on the controversy being settled and the purpose for which the release was actually given . . . .[but a] release may not be read to cover matters which the parties did not desire or intend to dispose of”) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). 37 ambiguous operative clause in a contract, it cannot create any right beyond those arising from the operative terms of the document.”203 Similarly, “although recitals in a contract cannot grant rights extending beyond those particularly described in the agreement, they may be useful in construing the rights and obligations created by the agreement.”204 Thus, under New York law, a recital may be helpful in interpreting the scope of a release, but it cannot create a substantive right beyond the express operative terms of the agreement. With this guidance, I turn to an analysis of the Release Agreement’s terms. 2. Who Released What? The Release Agreement was executed on July 1, 2013 as part of Akrimax’s reorganization and settlement.205 The Release Agreement, in its introduction, defines the term parties to mean Steve Laumas, Leonard Mazur, and Joseph Krivulka (the “Parties”).206 I note that CelestialRX is not included as a “Party.” The recitals to the Release Agreement indicate that “[t]he Parties, directly or indirectly, own one hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding membership interests of Akrimax Pharmaceuticals, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the ‘Company’)” and 203 Grand Manor Health Related Facility, Inc. v. Hamilton Equities Inc., 885 N.Y.S.2d 255, 256 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009); See RSL Commc'ns, PLC v. Bildirici, 2010 WL 846551, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2010) (observing that under New York law, recitals, such as “whereas” clauses, “can be used to clarify the meaning of an ambiguous contract, but cannot be used to modify or create substantive rights not found in the contract's operative clauses”). 204 In re FKF 3, LLC, 501 B.R. 491, 506 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). 205 See Eakins Aff. Ex. 51. 206 Id. at Introduction. 38 that “[t]he Parties desire to fully and finally settle any and all disputes and differences between them, both known and unknown, among themselves.”207 Under the heading “AGREEMENT” in the first subheading titled “1. Release of Claims,” the contract provides that: IN CONSIDERATION OF THE MUTUAL PROMISES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND OTHER GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, THE RECEIPT AND SUFFICIENCY WHEREOF IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE PARTIES, THE PARTIES, AND THEIR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, ATTORNEYS, ESTATES, AND ASSIGNS (THE ‘RELEASING PARTIES’) HEREBY AGREE TO FULLY RELEASE AND DISCHARGE EACH OF THE OTHER PARTIES, AND EACH OF THEIR PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE AGENTS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, MEMBERS, PARTNERS, PARTNERSHIPS, EMPLOYEES, REPRESENTATIVES, ATTORNEYS, ESTATES, VENDORS, OWNERS, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS (THE ‘RELEASED PARTIES’) FROM ANY AND ALL ACTIONS, CAUSES OF ACTION, SUITS, DEBTS, DUES, SUMS OF MONEY, ACCOUNTS, RECKONINGS, BONDS, BILLS, COVENANTS, CONTRACTS, CONTROVERSIES, AGREEMENTS, PROMISES, DAMAGES, JUDGMENTS, EXECUTIONS, DEMANDS, CLAIMS, OBLIGATIONS, AND/OR LIABILITIES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, DIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL, THAT THE RELEASING PARTIES EVER HAD, NOW HAVE, OR MAY IN THE FUTURE HAVE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FORGOING, THE RELEASES IN THIS PARAGRAPH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT IN ANY WAY LIMITED TO, THE RELEASING PARTIES’ FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE AND DISCHARGE OF THE RELEASED PARTIES FROM ANY AND ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO, ARISING FROM, 207 Id. at Recitals (emphasis added). 39 OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO ANY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY.208 The “Release of Claims” subheading of the Agreement, quoted above, defines Releasing Parties, and Released Parties, but it also uses terms previously defined in either the recitals (the Company), or in the introduction (the Parties).209 The Release Agreement provides, at a subheading titled “4. Entire Agreement” that: [t]his is a ‘fully integrated’ agreement. This Agreement contains the entire agreement of the Parties with respect to its subject matter, and all prior oral or written agreements, contracts, negotiations, representations and discussions, if any, pertaining to this matter and the Parties hereto are merged into this Agreement. No party to this Agreement has made any oral or written representation other than those set forth in this Agreement, and no party has relied upon, or is entering into, this Agreement in reliance upon any representation other than those set forth in this Agreement.210 The Release Agreement was signed over each individual Parties’ name.211 The issue before the Court on the Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment is whether CelestialRX is barred from bringing claims for pre-July 1, 2013 conduct by the release.212 “Parties” is a defined contractual term, specified to mean Mazur, Laumas, and Krivulka. The Releasing Parties—those releasing their claims—are defined as “the 208 Id. at § 1 (Capitalization in original). See id. I note that under New York law, a defined term in an introductory portion of a contract may be considered to “assist in determining the proper construction of a contract.” Potter v. Padilla, 38 N.Y.S.3d 372, 372 (N.Y. App. Div. 2016) (citations omitted). 210 Eakins Aff. Ex. 51. § 4. 211 Id. at Signature Blocks. 212 The same analysis applies to the second Entity Plaintiff controlled by Laumas, Krittika. 209 40 parties [Mazur, Lamas, and Krivulka], and their past, present and future agents, employees, representatives, attorneys, estates, and assigns. . . .” 213 CelestialRX is not an agent, employee, representative, attorney, estate or assign of Laumas. The contract defines Released Parties—those being released—more broadly, however. Released Parties includes the “other parties [Mazur, Lamas, and Krivulka], and each of their past, present and future agents, officers, directors, shareholders, members, partners, partnerships, employees, representatives, attorneys, estates, vendors, owners, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns”214 I find the language of the Release Agreement clear: CelestialRX is a Released Party, but not a Releasing Party, as those terms are explicitly described; therefore, the Plaintiff here, CelestialRX, did not release claims existing as of July 1, 2013.215 The Defendants point out that the recitals to the contract express that Laumas, along with the other named Parties, is an owner, direct or indirect, of Akrimax, and that the named Parties expressed the desire to settle all claims, “known and unknown, among themselves.”216 They argue that this precatory language is inconsistent with 213 Id. at § 1. Id. (emphasis added). I note that “affiliates” is an undefined contractual term, but its ordinary meaning would presumably include CelestialRX and Krittika. 215 While it does not inform my decision here based on the unambiguous language of the Release Agreement, I note that the signature block of the Release Agreement was signed over Laumas’ own name with no reference to CelestialRX, whereas other documents executed on July 1, 2013 clearly indicate when Laumas is signing on behalf of an entity. See Eakins Aff. Ex. 52 at Signature Block; Eakins Aff. Ex. 45 at Signature Block. 216 Eakins Aff. Ex. 51 at Recitals. 214 41 a reading of the release as barring claims by Laumas, but not his entity, CelestialRX, the direct Member of Akrimax. It is not clear to me that the intent expressed by the language of the recitals is inconsistent with the contractual release. In any event, to the extent the Defendants are correct, it is unhelpful to them; under New York law, the recitals can be employed to help to interpret an ambiguous contract, or limit the scope of an agreement, but not to vary the terms where no ambiguity exists or expand the scope of an operative section.217 The individual Parties to the release entered a contract that explicitly defined Releasing Parties more narrowly than Released Parties; CelestialRX is included in the latter, not the former. The Defendants argue vehemently that the intention of the parties at the time they entered the Release Agreement, as reflected in the record, is contrary to this express language. They point to much of the record evidence recited in the background section of this Memorandum Opinion, highlighting the dispute over the Middlemen Entities that had arisen among the Akrimax principals; and argue that, in light of that dispute, and in light of the drafting history, it would be nonsensical, and contrary to all Parties’ subjective intent, to have excluded CelestialRX from the release. Perhaps so: the argument may raise issues of reformation, but that issue is neither before me on the current motion nor generally susceptible to summary judgment. Accordingly, the 217 See Grand Manor Health Related Facility, Inc. v. Hamilton Equities Inc., 885 N.Y.S.2d 255, 256 (N.Y. App. Div. 2009); RSL Commc'ns, PLC v. Bildirici, 2010 WL 846551, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 2010). 42 Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment that CelestialRX has released claims existing as of July, 1, 2013, is denied. B. Duties Under the LLC Agreement The second prong of Defendants’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment seeks a judicial determination that Akrimax’s LLC Agreement together with Amendment No. 7 thereto “eliminated fiduciary duties.”218 Additionally, Defendants seek partial summary judgment that “Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of the LLC Agreement provide the applicable contractual burden of proof and/or persuasion for conflict transactions.”219 Thus the Defendants seek a determination that even if Amendment No. 7 did not eliminate fiduciary duties, and “some residual fiduciary duties survived, Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of the LLC Agreement provide express contractual standards for corporate opportunities and conflict transactions that displaced whatever remaining fiduciary duty might otherwise apply.” 220 The Defendants’ assert that their position presents “two paths” to the same result.221 These provisions are analyzed in turn below. I note that I have taken the unusual step of addressing this contractual standard before evidence of the behavior of the parties is fully in the record, because I believe that addressing the Defendants’ Krivulka Defs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment; Krivulka Defs’ Opening Br. 55. Krivulka Defs’ Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. 220 Krivulka Defs’ Opening Br. 55. 221 See Oct. 17, 2016 Oral Arg. Tr. 36:18–19 (“We have two paths to get there. These are paths that both lead to the same result.”). 218 219 43 motions in this fashion will clear some of the underbrush of this overgrown litigation, and allow rational litigation (or settlement) decisions going forward. The discussion below defines only duties applicable to the Defendants after July 1, 2013. 1. Amendment No. 7 Resolving the issues stated above requires interpretation of the fiduciary duties provided by Akrimax’s LLC Agreement. Specifically, the parties dispute the meaning of the language in Section 4.01(h)222 which was added by Amendment No. 7 on July 1, 2013, contemporaneously with the Release Agreement discussed above. Under the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (“LLC Act”) our Courts have implied fiduciary duties to managers of an LLC, unless contractually waived.223 This approach has been embodied in the LLC Act itself.224 In other words, the intention of the parties to the agreement that fiduciary duties apply to managers is implied where that agreement does not provide otherwise. The LLC Act is explicitly contractarian, however, and permits the elimination of some, or all, fiduciary duties for members, managers or others through a provision in an LLC agreement, 222 I note that Delaware law applies to the interpretation of Amendment No. 7 and the LLC Agreement. See Eakins Aff. Ex. 45 ¶ 16; Eakins Aff. Ex. 2 § 11.07. 223 See Kelly v. Blum, 2010 WL 629850, at *10 n.69 (Del. Ch. Feb. 24, 2010) (collecting cases and explaining interpretation); see also, Feeley v. NHAOCG, LLC, 62 A.3d 649, 661 (Del. Ch. 2012) (“the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act . . . contemplates that equitable fiduciary duties will apply by default to a manager or managing member of a Delaware LLC”). 224 See H.B. 126, 147th Gen. Assemb. (Del. 2013) (amending 6 Del. C. § 18-1104 to provide the following: “In any case not provided for in this chapter, the rules of law and equity, including the rules of law and equity relating to fiduciary duties and the law merchant, shall govern.”). 44 “provided, that the limited liability company agreement may not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing.”225 Similarly, in the context of construing LLC agreements, this Court has recognized that "[a]lthough fiduciary duties may be disclaimed, agreements' drafters must do so clearly, and should not be incentivized to obfuscate or surprise investors by ambiguously stripping away the protections investors would ordinarily receive.”226 Thus, this Court has consistently found that removal of a manager’s default fiduciary duties from an LLC agreement must be clear and unambiguous.227 The parties dispute the extent to which Amendment No. 7’s language removes, modifies, or alters fiduciary duties owed by Members, Managers, and Officers of Akrimax. The battleground in this dispute centers around whether the following language completely removes fiduciary duties—or removes fiduciary duties except for subparts (i) and (ii): [n]otwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Manager nor any of the members of the Board of Directors nor any Member shall have any fiduciary duties to the Company or the Members or shall be personally liable to the Company or its Members for a breach of any duty that does not involve (i) an act or omission not in good faith or which involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; or (ii) a transaction from which such Manager, a 225 6 Del. C. § 18-1101(c). Ross Holding & Mgmt. Co. v. Advance Realty Grp., LLC, 2014 WL 4374261, at *15 (Del. Ch. Sept. 4, 2014). 227 Feeley v. NHAOCG, LLC, 62 A.3d 649, 664 (Del. Ch. 2012) (“Drafters of an LLC agreement ‘must make their intent to eliminate fiduciary duties plain and unambiguous.’”) (quoting Bay Ctr. Apartments Owner, LLC v. Emery Bay PKI, LLC, 2009 WL 1124451, at *9 (Del. Ch. Apr. 20, 2009)). 226 45 member of the Board of Directors, or Member derived an improper personal benefit.228 Each side asserts various textual arguments regarding the above language. Further, in the alternative, the Krivulka Defendants argue that even if the above did not eliminate all fiduciary duties, the LLC Agreement provides specific contractual standards via Sections 8.01 and 8.02 to govern conflict transactions and corporate opportunities, respectively.229 Despite the linguistic, grammar and punctuation arguments each side advances,230 I read this provision by what I view as its plain meaning in accordance with Delaware law.231 I find that the plain language of 4.01(h) generally eliminates common-law fiduciary duties except that it retains liability for intentional or illegal misconduct and other bad faith actions, as well as for improper self-dealing.232 228 Eakins Aff. Ex. 45 ¶ 6(h). See Krivulka Defs’ Opening Br. 58. 230 Such arguments brought to my attention the existence of the “Purdue Owl,” which is apparently a helpful tool for grammarians. See Oct. 17, 2016 Oral Arg. Tr. 111:13–23. I note that I am cognizant of our case law that provides punctuation and grammar provide useful signposts. See Paul v. Deloitte & Touche, LLP, 974 A.2d 140, 146 (Del. 2009) (resolving “a grammatical dispute” in the interpretation of a contract). 231 Eakins Aff. Ex. 45 ¶ 16 (indicating Delaware law governs the interpretation of the amendment); Scion Breckenridge Managing Member, LLC v. ASB Allegiance Real Estate Fund, 68 A.3d 665, 683 (Del. 2013) (observing that under Delaware law, courts “interpret clear and unambiguous contract terms according to their plain meaning”). 232 The Plaintiffs have pled and asserted in briefing that all constituent documents of the July 1, 2013 agreements, including Amendment No. 7, were fraudulently induced and thus not enforceable. See Pls’ Answering Br. in Opposition to Krivulka Defs’ Motions 70–71 (arguing “Krivulka and/or Mazur fraudulently induced Laumas to enter into the Release Agreement (indeed, all of the July 1, 2013 Agreements, including the 7th Amendment to the Operating Agreement)”); Compl. at Count VIII. The issue of fraudulent inducement of Amendment No. 7 is reserved. 229 46 Those duties are contractual in nature, but to the extent they employ undefined terms such as “bad faith,” the common law fiduciary duties are instructive in supplying the definition. Subparts (i) and (ii) of Section 4.01(h) provide that Managers, Members and the Board are liable where they have acted in bad faith, or where they have engaged in certain acts of self-dealing; that is, have engaged in transactions creating an “improper personal benefit.”233 Interpreting, as I must, the contract as a whole, it becomes clear that whether a conflicted transaction involves an “improper personal benefit” must be assessed in light of Sections 8.01 and 8.02 of the LLC Agreement. As discussed below, I find that together these provisions provide specific contractual standards which govern conflict transactions and corporate opportunities. 2. Sections 8.01 and 8.02 Unfortunately, examination of liability here must involve an application of the facts to the contractual language of these sections—unfortunately, because, as is alltoo-common in LLC agreements litigated in this Court (a self-selecting sample, I acknowledge), the provisions here are poorly drafted. The text of the sections is as follows: [Section 8.01 provides:] (a) [u]nless entered into in bad faith, no contract or transaction between the Company and one or more of its See Eakins Aff. Ex. 45 ¶ 6(h) (“(i) an act or omission not in good faith or which involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; or (ii) a transaction from which such Manager, a member of the Board of Directors, or Member derived an improper personal benefit”). 233 47 Members or any Indemnified Party, or between the Company and any other Person in which one or more of its Members or any Indemnified Party has a financial interest or is a director, manager or officer, shall be voidable solely for this reason if such contract or transaction is fair and reasonable to the Company as determined in good faith by the Manager; and no Member or Indemnified Party interested in such contract or transaction, because of such interest, shall be liable to the Company or to any other Person or organization for any loss or expense incurred by reason of such contract or transaction or shall be accountable for any gains or profit realized from such contract or transaction.234 (b) [u]nless otherwise expressly provided herein, (i) whenever a conflict of interest exists or arises between the Company, its Members and/or the Indemnified Parties, or (ii) whenever this Agreement provides that any such Person shall act in a manner that is, or subject to Section 8.01(a) above, provide terms that are, fair and reasonable to the Company or any Member, such Person shall resolve such conflict of interest, taking such action or providing such terms, considering in each case the relative interest of each party (including its own interest) to such conflict, agreement, transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary or acceptable industry practices, and any applicable generally acceptable accounting practices or principles. In the absence of bad faith by the Member or Indemnified Party, as the case may be, the resolution, action or term so made, taken or provided by such Person shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein or of any duty or obligation of such Person at law or in equity or otherwise.235 [Section 8.02 provides:] [n]othing in this Agreement shall be construed to prohibit any Director or any Member from engaging in or possessing an interest in another business venture of any nature, even if competitive with the Company; and neither the Company nor any other Member shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement in or to any such venture or the income or profits derived therefrom. No Person solely by virtue of his or its status as a Director or Member of the Company, shall be prohibited from engaging in or possessing an 234 235 Zahler Aff. Ex. 3 § 8.01(a). Id. at § 8.01(b). 48 interest in another business venture of any nature, even if competitive with the Company. Neither any Director nor any Member shall be obligated, by the provisions hereof or by their status as a Director or Member, to present any particular investment or business opportunity to the Company even if such opportunity is of a nature which could be taken by the Company. This Section 8.02 is not intended to waive or amend any restriction on competition, confidentiality[,] disclosure, solicitation, or other activities, which may be governed by applicable law, or included in an employment agreement, confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement, or any other contract between the Company and any Member or Manager, which restrictions shall in all such matters control.236 a. Section 8.02 This section eschews the corporate opportunity doctrine, and permits conflicted interests to be held by Directors and Members, unless provided otherwise by separate contract. The requirements under which conflicted transactions are permitted are set out in the safe-harbor provisions of Section 8.01, discussed below. b. Section 8.01 The safe harbor of Section 8.01(a) exists where a conflicted transaction involving the Company and its Members or “any Indemnified Party”—a defined term that includes officers and affiliates237—is (1) entered in the absence of bad faith, and (2) the “Manager” (before July 1, 2013, collectively Mazur, Krivulka and Laumas; thereafter Krivulka) determines—in good faith—that the transaction is 236 Id. at § 8.02. See id. at Article I (defining “Indemnified Parties” stating it “shall mean the Manager, the Directors, any Affiliate of the Directors and each Officer of the Company and their respective successors and assigns, each in their capacity as such”). 237 49 “fair and reasonable to the Company.”238 In such case, the conflicted party bears no liability to the “Company or to any other Person” arising from the transaction. Section 8.01(b), as I read it, provides an alternative safe harbor. With respect to conflicted transactions as defined in Section 8.01(a), the terms of which are limited to those “fair and reasonable to the Company or any Member,” the conflicted party who seeks a safe harbor under subsection (b) is charged with “resolv[ing] such conflict” by “considering . . . the relative interest of each party (including its own interest) to such . . . transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interests, any customary or acceptable industry practices, and [GAAP].”239 Where the conflicted party has acted in good faith, and makes the required resolution of the conflict by a good-faith balancing of the factors above, he is insulated from liability, since he is deemed not in “breach of this Agreement . . . or of any duty or obligation . . . at law or in equity . . . .”240 Conflicted transactions not achieving one of these safe harbors are, by contrast, transactions from which the party may be shown to have derived an improper personal benefit under Section 4.01(h)(ii), in breach of his duty under that section. The parties do not contend that the safe harbor of Section 8.01(a) applies here. Therefore, the Defendants will be found not to have breached a duty under Section 238 Id. at § 8.01(a). Id. at § 8.01(b). 240 Id. 239 50 4.01(h)(ii), and are insulated from liability under Section 8.01(b), where the conflicted transaction was (1) entered in good faith,241 and (2) where the particular Defendant subjectively determined that the transaction was fair and reasonable to the Company and Members after the required good-faith balancing of interests. That is the standard against which the challenged transactions (entered on or after July 1, 2013) shall be evaluated. This specific contractual standard applies to all Indemnified Parties, as defined in the LLC Agreement.242 I note that good faith—a subjective standard, applies separately to both the transaction and to the conflicted party’s analysis of whether it is “fair and reasonable.” I do, however, note that the subjective good faith standard here must be read consistently with the purpose of Sections 8.01 and 8.02, which is to permit conflicted transactions in certain circumstances.243 241 Our Supreme Court, when faced with an undefined good faith or bad faith provision in an alternative entity situation has employed the following standard: “an action ‘so far beyond the bounds of reasonable judgment that it seems essentially inexplicable on any ground other than bad faith.’” DV Realty Advisors LLC v. Policemen's Annuity & Ben. Fund of Chicago, 75 A.3d 101, 110 (Del. 2013) (quoting Brinckerhoff v. Enbridge Energy Co., 67 A.3d 369, 373 (Del. 2013)). 242 See Zahler Aff. Ex. 3 at Article I, § 8.01(b). 243 See Related Westpac LLC v. JER Snowmass LLC, 2010 WL 2929708, at *8 (Del. Ch. July 23, 2010) (explaining that when parties to an alternative entity “cover a particular subject in an express manner, their contractual choice governs and cannot be supplanted by the application of inconsistent fiduciary duty principles that might otherwise apply as a default”). 51 IV. CONCLUSION For the forgoing reasons, the Defendants’ Motions for Partial Summary Judgment are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. Specifically, the prong of the motion regarding the release is DENIED. The prong of the motion interpreting fiduciary duties owed by the governing documents is resolved consistent with the discussion above. The parties should confer regarding the most efficient way to move this matter forward in light of this Memorandum Opinion. 52

INTRODUCTION 

1. 

Beginning not later than December 2009, Defendants conspired to fix 

Plaintiff CompuCredit’s convertible senior note prices and to coerce CompuCredit to pay 

inflated, above-market prices for those notes. Defendants’ acts in furtherance of this 

conspiracy include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) jointly demanding that 

CompuCredit pay the full, face value (or “par”) of CompuCredit’s convertible senior 




- 1 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 3 of 28

notes in Defendants’ possession—almost twice their current market price; (b) in 

contravention of each Defendant’s economic self-interest, providing false letters and 

other communications to third parties contending that CompuCredit is insolvent and that 

it violated certain indentures; (c) as acknowledged by David Kay on behalf of 

Defendants, agreeing to purchase CompuCredit’s convertible senior notes after making 

these insolvency and other allegations in order to inflate the prices of those notes; 

(d) conspiring to boycott CompuCredit’s January 28, 2010 offer to repurchase its 

convertible senior notes; and (e) filing a sham lawsuit contending that CompuCredit is 

insolvent when they know it to be untrue. 

2. 

As requested relief herein, CompuCredit prays that this Court enjoin 

Defendants’ conspiracy and order Defendants to tender their CompuCredit convertible 

senior notes to CompuCredit at the highest price that CompuCredit paid pursuant to its 

January 28, 2010 offer to repurchase its Notes. Alternatively, CompuCredit prays that 

this Court enjoin Defendants from concertedly attempting to affect the price of 

CompuCredit’s convertible senior notes and to prohibit Defendants from communicating 

with each other regarding CompuCredit’s convertible senior notes, and from 

communicating with each other and third parties regarding CompuCredit’s alleged 

insolvency and/or CompuCredit’s alleged breach of any Indenture. 

PARTIES 

3. 

CompuCredit is a Georgia corporation with its principal place of business 

in Atlanta, Georgia. CompuCredit is a provider of various credit and related financial 

services and products.

4. 

Defendants were all parties to the suit Akanthos Capital Management, LLC,

not insubstantial amount of interstate commerce. 




- 5 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 7 of 28

20. Venue is appropriately laid in this judicial district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 

§ 1391(b). A substantial part of the events giving rise to this case arose in the District of 

Minnesota. The Akanthos Lawsuit was filed by Defendants in the District of Minnesota, 

and three hearings were held in Minnesota. The law firm that was the agent of 

Defendants and acted at their direction at all times pertinent to this action has its principal 

place of business in the District of Minnesota and sent the purported “settlement” offer 

from Defendants to CompuCredit from the District of Minnesota. 

FACTS 

21. 

Beginning not later than sometime in December 2009, Defendants agreed 

to coerce CompuCredit to repurchase its convertible senior notes from each Defendant at 

inflated, above-market prices. 

I. 



COMPUCREDIT’S CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES AND THE 
INDENTURES 

22. Defendants claim 

to own approximately 70% of CompuCredit’s 

outstanding convertible senior notes (collectively, the “Notes”), which were issued by 

CompuCredit in two series: (a) 3.625% convertible notes due in the year 2025 pursuant to 

and governed by an Indenture dated May 27, 2005 (the “2025 Notes”); and (b) 5.875% 

convertible senior notes due in the year 2035 pursuant to and governed by an Indenture 

dated November 23, 2005 (the “2035 Notes”). The holders of the 2025 Notes may 

require the Company to repurchase some or all of their notes in 2012. The 2035 Notes 

have no similar provision. The Notes were originally issued pursuant to private 

placements. 




- 6 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 8 of 28

23. 

Each Indenture sets forth the rights of the Noteholders. As is customary 

with convertible notes, the Noteholders negotiated for the right to convert their Notes into 

common stock in lieu of the financial covenants that might restrict or require noteholder 

approval of certain transactions. Consequently, there are no covenants prohibiting the 

payment of dividends or spin-off transactions. In fact, the Indentures expressly 

contemplate a variety of corporate transactions and provide for adjustments to the 

conversion rate when they occur. 

II. COMPUCREDIT’S DIVIDEND AND DEFENDANTS’ ORIGINAL 

DEMAND 



24. 

In a December 3, 2009 press release, CompuCredit announced “a dividend 

of $.50 per share payable to holders of record as of the close of trading on December 31, 

2009,” totaling approximately $25 million. In the same press release, CompuCredit also 

announced that it was “considering a tax-free spin-off of its U.S. and U.K. micro-loan 

businesses into a publicly-traded company.” (Emphasis added). This press release made 

clear that the proposed spin-off had not yet been approved by CompuCredit’s Board of 

Directors. In accordance with the Indentures, written notice of the dividend was provided 

to the Indenture Trustee, U.S. Bank National Association. 

25. 

In a December 8, 2009 letter, Defendants complained to CompuCredit 

about the dividend and the contemplated spin-off. Among other things, Defendants 

demanded that CompuCredit retract its then-planned dividend. 




- 7 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 9 of 28

26. However, as later events have now made clear, Defendants followed this 

strategy as part and parcel of a conspiracy to coerce CompuCredit to buy Defendants’ 

Notes at inflated, above-market prices. 

III. THE AKANTHOS LAWSUIT 



A. 

27. 

CompuCredit’s Solvency 

In CompuCredit’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 

2009 (filed November 9, 2009), CompuCredit reported equity in excess of $254 million 

and over $119 million in cash. 

28. 

In CompuCredit’s Form 10-K relating to the year 2009 (filed March 5, 

2010), CompuCredit reported equity in excess of $207 million and over $190 million in 

cash. 

29. 

CompuCredit has never missed a single interest payment with respect to the 

2025 Notes or the 2035 Notes. 

30. 

B. 



CompuCredit has paid, and is paying, its debts as they come due. 

Defendants’ First Complaint 

31. Defendants filed the Akanthos Lawsuit on December 21, 2009 along with a 

Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction, and Expedited 

Discovery. Defendants sought to enjoin the dividend, as well as the contemplated, but 

not yet approved, spin-off. Defendants falsely alleged that both the distribution and the 

spin-off were fraudulent transfers because, among other things, CompuCredit was 

allegedly “insolvent.” 




- 8 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 10 of 28

32. Defendants’ First Complaint contained two counts: (a) a claim under the 

Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act (“UFTA”); and (b) a claim under the Georgia 

corporate code. 

33. 

In Defendants’ First Complaint, Defendants did not seek damages in any 

form. 

34. 

In Defendants’ First Complaint, Defendants did not ask the Court to compel 

CompuCredit to repurchase Defendants’ Notes at any price. 

35. 

The Defendants’ decision not to ask the Court to compel CompuCredit to 

repurchase Defendants’ Notes illustrates that the Defendants filed the Akanthos Lawsuit 

for the improper purpose of coercing CompuCredit to repurchase Defendants’ Notes, 

rather than for the legitimate purpose of seeking judicial relief. 

C. 

The December 29, 2009 TRO Hearing 

36. On December 29, 2009, after a hearing on the merits of Defendants’ motion 

for a temporary restraining order, this Court denied Defendants’ request to enjoin 

CompuCredit’s distribution to shareholders as well as Defendants’ request for expedited 

discovery. Accordingly, CompuCredit made the dividend payment to shareholders on 

December 31, 2009. 

37. As part of his Order denying the Defendants’ requested preliminary 

injunctive relief, the Honorable James M. Rosenbaum for the United States District Court 

of Minnesota specifically found that CompuCredit was not insolvent: 

But third, and in its way, the most profoundly troubling to the Court, is the 
claim that the corporation is insolvent. It is not insolvent. The plaintiffs 
advance the affidavit of an accountant who is an accounting expert, a CPA, 




- 9 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 11 of 28

who says it is insolvent on a pro-forma basis. A pro forma is a set of 
assumptions that are made about events in the view of the person who 
advances it. And if you add and subtract the numbers Mr. McDonough 
thinks need to be added and subtracted, you could extract, I guess, the fact 
that the corporation is insolvent. On the other hand, there’s no indication 
whatsoever that there is an accepted methodology for applying to a regular 
and ongoing corporation his set of pro-forma assumptions in a fashion 
which shows that this court ought to step in, into what is otherwise a 
functioning marketplace, and substitute its judgment for that of the Board 
of Directors. . . . But at this point there is precious little, other than his 
own ad hominem belief in the validity of his own opinions, that this 
company is somehow insolvent. 


Transcript of Proceedings, Dec. 29, 2009 at 62-63 (emphasis added). 


D. 

CompuCredit’s Possible Spin-Off 

38. On January 4, 2010, a Form 10 was filed with the SEC regarding Purpose 

Financial Holdings, Inc. (“Purpose Financial”). Purpose Financial is CompuCredit’s 

micro-loan business that could be subject to the possible “spin-off” transaction. If the 

spin-off occurs, CompuCredit shareholders will receive shares in Purpose Financial. The 

SEC approval process is a necessary, preliminary step that must be completed before 

CompuCredit’s Board of Directors can consider approving the spin-off. 

E. 

Defendants’ Amended Complaint 

39. On January 26, 2010, CompuCredit filed a Motion to Dismiss the First 

Complaint. After this motion was filed, Defendants voluntarily dismissed Count II of 

their First Complaint, i.e., the count relating to the alleged violation of the Georgia 

corporate code. 




- 10 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 12 of 28

40. On February 22, 2010, Defendants filed their Amended Complaint. In their 

Amended Complaint, Defendants asserted a single cause of action claiming that the 

dividend and the possible spin-off violated the UFTA. 

41. 

The focus of the Amended Complaint is the possible spin-off of Purpose 

Financial. However, recognizing that the original claim to enjoin the payment to 

shareholders was now moot, Defendants inserted a naked and unsupported claim for 

damages related to the dividend. Specifically, Defendants seek $25 million, i.e., the same 

amount as the December 31, 2009 dividend, as damages. 

42. 

In Defendants’ Amended Complaint, Defendants have not asked the Court 

to compel CompuCredit to repurchase Defendants’ Notes at any price. 

43. Defendants’ Amended Complaint is equally baseless as their First 

Complaint. Defendants do not believe—nor would any reasonable litigant believe—that 

CompuCredit’s publicly-announced and contemplated spin-off constitutes a fraudulent 

transfer, because, among other things, Defendants know that CompuCredit is not 

insolvent. 

44. 

The damages claim included in Defendants’ Amended Complaint is 

baseless. Neither Minnesota nor Georgia’s UFTA permits a damages claim against the 

transferor/debtor, i.e., CompuCredit. Moreover, Defendants know—as any reasonable 

litigant would know—that they have not suffered any monetary losses as a result of the 

conduct that they challenge because, as noted above and as Judge Rosenbaum found, 

CompuCredit is not insolvent.

IV. DEFENDANTS’ CONSPIRACY TO BOYCOTT COMPUCREDIT’S 

JANUARY 2010 OFFER TO REPURCHASE ITS NOTES 



A. 

Defendants Suggest That CompuCredit Use Its Cash To Repurchase 
CompuCredit’s Notes At Discounted Prices. 


45. At the December 29, 2009 hearing relating to Defendants’ motion for a 

temporary restraining order, Defendants’ counsel argued that CompuCredit should not 

use its cash to declare a dividend, but should instead use its cash to repurchase its bonds 

at discounted prices. 

46. 

For example, at the December 29, 2009 hearing, Defendants’ counsel 

stated: 

a. 

“[A] good strategy would be to take any cash and buy back their 
debt, buy back these notes at deeply discounted prices.” Transcript 
of Proceedings, Dec. 29, 2009 at 17. 

“They could get huge reductions—50, 60 percent.” Id. at 26. 


b. 

CompuCredit’s January 2010 Offer To Repurchase Its Notes 

B. 

47. On January 22, 2010, Defendants’ counsel filed a sworn declaration stating 

that “. . . counsel for the [CompuCredit] informed me that Compucredit [sic] was 

interested in purchasing holders’ notes and that holders should speak directly with 

company management on that topic. Later that day and subsequently I was contacted by 

several note holders [sic], both clients and non clients, who informed me that the 

Company offered to buy their notes at current market prices.” 

48. On January 28, 2010, CompuCredit made an offer to repurchase up to 

$160.0 million aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. The prices that 




- 12 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 14 of 28

CompuCredit offered to pay in this offer were either equal to, or slightly above, then-

existing market prices. 

49. 

Pursuant to the January 28, 2010 offer, CompuCredit recently repurchased 

$40.3 million in aggregate face amount of the 2025 and 2035 Notes (approximately 11% 

and 10% of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, respectively) for an aggregate 

total cost of $17.8 million. CompuCredit repurchased the 2025 Notes for $500 per 

$1,000 principal amount of such Notes, for a total cost of $12,358,500. The 2035 Notes 

were repurchased at a price of $350 per $1,000 principal amount of such Notes, for a total 

cost of $5,443,900. Excluding accrued interest and fees and other expenses in connection 

with the January 28, 2010 offer, the Notes were repurchased for an aggregate total cost of 

$17,802,400. Upon information and belief, those that accepted CompuCredit’s 

January 28, 2010 offer are sophisticated parties with knowledge of the fair value of 

CompuCredit’s Notes. 

50. None of the Defendants tendered their Notes to CompuCredit pursuant to 

CompuCredit’s January 28, 2010 offer. 

51. On information and belief, Defendants agreed among themselves to refrain 

from tendering their Notes to CompuCredit pursuant to CompuCredit’s January 28, 2010 

offer. 

C. 


52. 

Defendants’ Boycott Of The January 28, 2010 Offer And Collusive 
Demand On CompuCredit Harmed Competition. 

There exists a relevant market, the product dimension of which is 

CompuCredit Notes, and the geographic dimension of which is the United States. 




- 13 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 15 of 28

53. 

CompuCredit’s Notes are unique. Among other things, they could be 

converted into CompuCredit’s common stock. And from CompuCredit’s perspective, 

there is no reasonable substitute for CompuCredit’s Notes because the repurchase or 

redemption of its own Notes is the only means by which CompuCredit can extinguish this 

debt prior to maturity. 

54. 

CompuCredit cannot repurchase its Notes from any source other than 

CompuCredit Noteholders. 

55. Defendants have market power in the market for CompuCredit Notes as 

they claim to hold approximately 70% of the Notes. 

56. Defendants’ boycott of the January 28, 2010 offer and their collusive 

demand that CompuCredit repurchase their Notes at par harms competition by inflating 

the price at which CompuCredit and others can purchase CompuCredit’s Notes. 

V. 



DEFENDANTS MADE FALSE STATEMENTS AS PART OF THEIR 
CONSPIRACY TO COERCE COMPUCREDIT TO REPURCHASE 
DEFENDANTS’ NOTES AT INFLATED, ABOVE-MARKET PRICES. 

57. After failing in federal court, Defendants began seeking non-judicial routes 

to coerce CompuCredit to repurchase Defendants’ Notes at inflated, above-market prices. 

Specifically, as part of their conspiracy, Defendants proceeded to make and publish 

several false, out-of-court statements regarding CompuCredit’s alleged insolvency and 

breaches of the Indentures. 

58. 

By advancing the below-described communications, Defendants acted 

against the unilateral and individual economic interests to promote their price-fixing and 

bid-rigging conspiracy. Indeed, unless a conspiracy exists, Defendants have no incentive 




- 14 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 16 of 28

to make communications that CompuCredit is insolvent or breached the Indentures. 

Indeed, such communications would logically decrease CompuCredit bond prices, and 

thus harm Defendants’ economic self-interests. But for the same reasons that 

Defendants’ statements are against their own economic self-interests, Defendants know 

that their communications will harm CompuCredit and therefore pressure it to bring the 

Akanthos Lawsuit to an end by any means possible, including purchasing Defendants’ 

Notes at inflated prices. Thus, by advancing the below-described communications, 

Defendants acted against their unilateral and individual economic interests to promote 

their price-fixing and bid-rigging conspiracy. 

59. Defendants’ below-described communications are acts in furtherance of 

their conspiracy to coerce CompuCredit to pay inflated, above-market prices for its 

convertible senior notes. These joint communications further demonstrated the concerted 

nature of Defendants’ actions and the existence of an agreement, combination, and 

conspiracy in restraint to trade. 



A. 

60. 

The January 27, 2010 BDO Letter 

Almost one month after the U.S. District Court for the District of 

Minnesota specifically found that CompuCredit was solvent, on January 27, 2010, 

Defendants’ counsel sent a letter to CompuCredit’s auditor, BDO Seidman, LLP (“BDO 

Letter”). 

61. 

The BDO Letter attached a copy of Defendants’ alleged expert report from 

Edward M. McDonough (“McDonough Report”). By sending McDonough’s report to 

BDO, among other ways, Defendants adopted the statements contained therein as true. 




- 15 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 17 of 28

62. 

The BDO Letter quoted Mr. McDonough and falsely concluded that the 

“ability of [CompuCredit] to continue as a going concern” was “uncertain.” 

63. Moreover, the BDO Letter falsely stated that “CompuCredit’s ability to 

continue as a going concern is not merely uncertain but is subject to ‘substantial doubt.’” 

(Citing SAS 59). 

64. Defendants’ communications to BDO Seidman would logically decrease 

the prices of CompuCredit’s convertible senior notes. By making said communications, 

therefore, Defendants acted against their unilateral and individual economic self-interests. 

Absent the conspiracy alleged herein, Defendants would not have made these 

communications to BDO Seidman. 



B. 

65. 

The February 5, 2010 SEC Letter 

By letter dated February 5, 2010, Defendants wrote the Securities and 

Exchange Commission (“SEC Letter”) and made similar false statements as in the BDO 

Letter. 

66. 

In the SEC Letter, Defendants falsely stated “[CompuCredit] is already 

insolvent.” 

67. 

The SEC Letter was sent approximately 38 days after the U.S. District 

Court for the District of Minnesota specifically found that CompuCredit was solvent. 

68. 

The Defendants did not inform the SEC of this finding by the U.S. District 

Court for the District of Minnesota. 

69. Defendants’ communications to the SEC would logically decrease the 

prices of CompuCredit’s convertible senior notes. By making said communications, 




- 16 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 18 of 28

therefore, Defendants acted against their unilateral and individual economic self-interests. 

Absent the conspiracy alleged herein, Defendants would not have made these 

communications to the SEC. 



C. 

Defendants’ Communications To U.S. Bank 

70. As stated above, U.S. Bank National Association (“U.S. Bank”) is the 

indenture trustee for the Notes purchased by Defendants. 

1. 

In court, Defendants contended that CompuCredit did not 
the 
breach 
Indentures were 
“irrelevant.” 

Indentures and 

that 

the 


In court, Defendants contended that CompuCredit had not breached the 

71. 

Indentures and that the Indentures were irrelevant to the Akanthos Lawsuit. 

72. 

For example, at the December 29, 2009 hearing before Judge Rosenbaum, 

Defendants’ counsel stated that “this is not an indenture case” and that “we’re not here 

saying that that contract [i.e., the Indenture] has been breached at this point in time.” 

Transcript of Proceedings, Dec. 29, 2009 at 4, 18. 

73. 

In addition, on March 19, 2010, Defendants’ counsel stated that “[t]he 

Indenture is absolutely irrelevant to this case and to the issues which are before your 

Honor.” Transcript of Proceedings, Mar. 19, 2010 at 21-22. 

Out of court, Defendants contended that CompuCredit breached 
the Indentures. 

2. 



74. According to U.S. Bank, Defendants communicated at least two times with 

U.S. Bank in late 2009/early 2010. 




- 17 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 19 of 28

75. 

These communications with U.S. Bank included false statements regarding 

CompuCredit’s alleged breaches of the Indentures. Specifically, and according to a 

March 15, 2010 letter sent by U.S. Bank to CompuCredit (“U.S. Bank Letter”), 

Defendants falsely communicated to U.S. Bank that CompuCredit “is violating the 

Indentures and intends to do so in the future.” 

76. U.S. Bank noted that these communications were made in the form of “very 

vocal allegations by Noteholders.” 

77. Defendants’ communications to U.S. Bank would logically decrease the 

prices of CompuCredit’s convertible senior notes. By making said communications, 

therefore, Defendants acted against their unilateral and individual economic self-interests. 

Absent the conspiracy alleged herein, Defendants would not have made these 

communications to U.S. Bank. 

VI. DEFENDANTS DEMAND THAT COMPUCREDIT REPURCHASE 

DEFENDANTS’ NOTES AT PAR. 



78. On March 9, 2010, CompuCredit and Defendants participated in a 

discovery conference in the Akanthos Lawsuit. 

79. On March 8, 2010, Defendants’ counsel made the following demand on 

CompuCredit: 

In anticipation of tomorrow’s pretrial conference, plaintiffs hereby 
demand par with respect to their entire holdings of each of the two 
series of CompuCredit notes, together with all accrued and unpaid 
interest as of the date of tender. 

We look forward to your response. 





- 18 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 20 of 28

80. 

In early March 2010, CompuCredit’s 2025 Notes traded at approximately 

53.5% of par. 

81. 

In early March 2010, CompuCredit’s 2035 Notes traded at approximately 

37% of par. 

82. Again, Defendants never sought relief to compel CompuCredit to 

repurchase Defendants’ Notes at any price in their First Complaint or Amended 

Complaint in the Akanthos Lawsuit, let alone at par. 

83. No law permitted, or permits, Defendants to seek relief to compel 

CompuCredit to repurchase Defendants’ Notes at any price. Indeed, if such law existed, 

Defendants would have alleged it in the Akanthos Lawsuit. Defendants’ March 8, 2010 

demand, therefore, has no reasonable relation to the Akanthos Lawsuit. 

84. Defendants’ agreement to refuse to sell the Notes at anything other than 

inflated prices continues to this day. 

VII. DEFENDANTS’ CONTINUED PURCHASES OF COMPUCREDIT’S 

NOTES 



85. 

If Defendants truly believed—as they have contended in and out of court—

that CompuCredit was insolvent, they would not continue to purchase CompuCredit’s 

Notes. 

86. On or about March 24, 2010, David Kay, on behalf of Defendant Tenor, 

telephoned CompuCredit’s Treasurer, William R. McCamey. 

87. During this March 24 telephone call, Kay told CompuCredit’s Treasurer, 

among other things, the following: 




- 19 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 21 of 28

a. 

the “group,” i.e., Defendants, had recently purchased CompuCredit’s 

Notes; 

b. 

Defendants increased their purchases of CompuCredit’s Notes after 

the December 29, 2009 hearing regarding Defendants’ motion for a 

temporary restraining order. 

Specifically, Kay stated 

that 

Defendants increased their stake in CompuCredit’s 2025 Notes and 

as a result of this increased stake, they owned more than 

$140,000,000 of CompuCredit’s 2025 Notes; 

c. When a company, such as CompuCredit, engages in a offer to 

repurchase notes, it is traditional to first establish the price of the 

offer with the largest noteholders prior to the tender; 

d. 

Defendants agreed as a group not to participate in CompuCredit’s 

January 28, 2010 offer because the offered price, according to 

Defendants, was too low; and 

e. 

Defendants would sell their notes to CompuCredit between 65-70% 

of par, which was a premium to the recent market trades and 

Defendants thought that that was an appropriate reference price. 

88. On March 26, 2010, Kay spoke to CompuCredit’s Treasurer again. During 

this call, Kay repeated the statements described in the immediately-preceding paragraph. 

89. 

Pursuant to Defendants’ coordinated efforts, another Defendant represented 

to CompuCredit that it possessed a document containing the amount of notes held by all 




- 20 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 22 of 28

Defendants and that Defendants now collectively owned over $150,000,000 of 

CompuCredit’s 2025 Notes. 

90. 

There is no legitimate, pro-competitive reason for Defendants to possess 

information regarding the quantity of CompuCredit’s Notes owned by other Defendants. 

91. 

Currently, CompuCredit has approximately $206,000,000 of 2025 Notes 

outstanding. Therefore, according to certain of the Defendants, Defendants now own 

approximately 73% of CompuCredit’s 2025 Notes, and approximately 70% of 

CompuCredit’s 2025 Notes and 2035 Notes combined. 

VIII. DEFENDANTS KNOW THE AKANTHOS LAWSUIT IS A SHAM. 

92. 

The Akanthos Lawsuit was filed, and is maintained, as a part of 

Defendants’ conspiracy to coerce CompuCredit to pay inflated, above-market prices for 

Defendants’ Notes. 

93. Defendants’ March 8, 2010 demand demonstrates that Defendants knew, 

and know, that the Akanthos Lawsuit was, and is, a sham, objectively baseless, and filed 

for the improper purpose of obtaining supracompetitive prices for their Notes, because, 

among other things: (a) Defendants could not, and did not, seek relief to compel 

CompuCredit to repurchase Defendants’ Notes at any price; (b) Defendants thereafter 

demanded that CompuCredit repurchase their Notes at full price; (c) Defendants know 

that CompuCredit has never missed a payment with respect to its convertible senior 

notes; (d) Defendants know that CompuCredit has over $207 million in equity as of 

December 31, 2009; and (e) if Defendants truly believed that CompuCredit was or is 




- 21 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 23 of 28

becoming insolvent (as they represented in and out of court), they would not have 

continued to purchase CompuCredit’s bonds. 

94. 

In light of the facts that Defendants knew when they filed their two 

Akanthos complaints, no reasonable litigant could believe that the Akanthos Lawsuit 

would succeed. 

95. 

The Defendants are not pursuing the Akanthos Lawsuit based upon an 

actual desire to secure judicial relief; rather, they are using it as a means of coercing 

CompuCredit to pay inflated, above-market prices for the Notes. 

Violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 

COUNT I 

96. 

CompuCredit incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as if fully 



set forth herein. 

97. Defendants entered into contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint 

of trade, which continue to this day, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 

U.S.C. § 1. 

98. 

The unlawful contracts, combinations, and conspiracies consist of 

agreements among the Defendants to inflate CompuCredit’s bond prices, to boycott 

CompuCredit’s January 28, 2010 tender offer and future tender offers, and instead jointly 

demand that CompuCredit repurchase Defendants’ Notes at par. 

99. 

Each of the Defendants had actual knowledge of, and knowingly 

participated in, the contracts, combinations, and conspiracies described herein. 




- 22 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 24 of 28

100. The unlawful contracts, combinations, and conspiracies alleged herein 

unreasonably restrain trade in the market for CompuCredit Notes, in that they have the 

effect of inflating the price at which CompuCredit can extinguish its debt by purchasing 

these Notes. 

101. The unlawful contracts, combinations, and conspiracies alleged herein have 

harmed, and continue to harm, CompuCredit in its business or property. 

102. The unlawful contracts, combinations, and conspiracies described herein 

are likely to continue unless enjoined. 

103. CompuCredit has been injured, and is currently threatened with injury, by 

reason of the anticompetitive agreement and actions taken by the Defendants in violation 

of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 

104. CompuCredit’s Notes are unique to CompuCredit. CompuCredit cannot 

purchase reasonably-substitutable notes from any other person. 

105. Moreover, and due to, among other things, the part of Defendants’ 

conspiracy that requires them to publish false statements regarding CompuCredit, 

monetary damages are inadequate to remedy the harm that Plaintiff CompuCredit has 

suffered and continues to suffer as a result of the contracts, combinations, and 

conspiracies described herein. 

106. Defendants’ agreement includes an agreement not to sell the Notes at 

market prices and only to sell the Notes at inflated, above-market prices resulting from 

their conspiracy and, accordingly, is illegal per se. 




- 23 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 25 of 28

107. Plaintiff CompuCredit therefore requests that this Court issue an order, 

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 57, that the contracts, combinations, 

and conspiracies described herein violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. 

Violation of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1 

COUNT II 



108. CompuCredit incorporates by reference the following paragraphs as if fully 

set forth herein: 1 (except (e)), 2-3, 5-30, 36-38, 48-64, 70, 74-81, and 84-91. In the 

alternative to Count I, CompuCredit does not incorporate any allegation that the Akanthos 

Lawsuit is a sham in this Count II. 

109. Defendants entered into contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint 

of trade, which continue to this day, in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 

U.S.C. § 1. 

110. As described in the March 2010 and other communications alleged herein, 

Defendants agreed and conspired to artificially inflate the price of CompuCredit’s bonds. 

111. Defendants’ agreement is not only shown via their admissions in the March 

2010 and other communications alleged herein, but it is also demonstrated by, among 

other things: 

a. 

Defendants’ actions against their individual economic interests, 

including, without limitation, the BDO Letter and Defendants’ 

communications with U.S. Bank; 

b. 

Defendants’ continued purchasing of CompuCredit’s Notes after 

alleging that CompuCredit is, or was to become, insolvent; and 




- 24 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 26 of 28

c. 

Defendants’ boycott of the January 28, 2010 CompuCredit tender 

offer and future tender offers. 

112. Each of the Defendants had actual knowledge of, and knowingly 

participated in, the conspiracy described herein. 

113. The unlawful contracts, combinations, and conspiracies alleged herein 

unreasonably restrain trade in the market for CompuCredit Notes, in that they have the 

effect of inflating the price at which CompuCredit can pay down its debt by purchasing 

its Notes. 

114. The unlawful contracts, combinations, and conspiracies alleged herein have 

harmed, and continue to harm, CompuCredit in its business or property. 

115. The unlawful contracts, combinations, and conspiracies described herein 

are likely to continue unless enjoined. 

116. CompuCredit’s Notes are unique to CompuCredit. CompuCredit cannot 

purchase reasonably-substitutable notes from any other person. 

117. Moreover, and due to, among other things, the part of Defendants’ 

conspiracy that requires them to publish false statements regarding CompuCredit, 

monetary damages are inadequate to remedy the harm that Plaintiff CompuCredit has 

suffered and continues to suffer as a result of the contracts, combinations, and 

conspiracies described herein. 

118. Defendants’ agreement includes an agreement not to sell the Notes at 

market prices and only to sell the Notes at inflated, above-market prices resulting from 

their conspiracy and, accordingly, is illegal per se. 




- 25 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 27 of 28

119. Plaintiff CompuCredit therefore requests that this Court issue an order, 

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 57, that the contracts, combinations, 

and conspiracies described herein violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1. 



PRAYER FOR RELIEF 

WHEREFORE, CompuCredit respectfully requests that this Court: 

1. 

2. 

Enter a judgment declaring that Defendants violated 15 U.S.C. § 1; 

Order each Defendant to tender any and all of CompuCredit’s 2025 Notes 

and 2035 Notes in its possession, custody, or control to CompuCredit at the highest prices 

that CompuCredit paid pursuant to its January 28, 2010 tender, namely, 50% of par for 

the 2025 Notes and 35% of par for the 2035 Notes; 

3. 

OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE to #2: For a period of two years from the 

date of the judgment, enjoin each Defendant from: 

a. 

Engaging in any form of joint activity or coordinated action 

concerning the price of any CompuCredit convertible senior note; 

and 

b. 

Communicating with each other 

regarding CompuCredit’s 

convertible senior notes, and from communicating with each other 

and third parties regarding CompuCredit’s alleged insolvency and/or 

CompuCredit’s alleged breach of any Indenture; 




- 26 - 

Case 0:10-cv-01213-JRT-JJK Document 1 Filed 04/08/10 Page 28 of 28

4. 

Award CompuCredit its costs, disbursements, and attorneys’ fees as 

authorized by law;1 and 

5. 

Grant CompuCredit such other and further relief as is just and equitable.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
