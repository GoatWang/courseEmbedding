Dorothy Ann “Dot” (Lessa) Bongiorno, 89, entered into eternal life on Friday, June 2, 2017 at the Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune, NJ.  Born in Newark, NJ, daughter of the late Francis and Josephine (Bruno) Lessa, she resided in Bloomfield, NJ, Flemington, NJ, and most recently in Tinton Falls.

Upon graduating from high school, Dorothy worked at Blue Cross Blue Shield in Newark for many years. After raising her family and caring for her mother, she worked at Snooty Fox Boutique in Caldwell, NJ as a salesperson.  Dot was an avid seamstress from childhood to adulthood.  She loved to watch movies, travel, read biographies and spend time with family and her grandchildren.  She especially cherished time at her summer home in Barnegat with her beloved husband, Joseph. She joined and enjoyed the Italian American Club at the Seabrook Village in Tinton Falls.  Before that, she loved being part of the Flemington Women’s Club and the Flemington Senior Citizens Group where she participated in the chair yoga group.  While living in Flemington, Dot participated with the community events at Flemington Fields.  She was a parishioner of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Roman Catholic Church in Three Bridges, NJ.

Dorothy lovingly cared for her husband Joseph for many years. She was a devoted wife and they shared a special bond for 60 years. Dot raised four children and created a home that included her parents and welcomed her sister, niece and nephew as a true extended family. She had many friends and enjoyed socializing with those around her.

Besides her parents, Dot was predeceased by her beloved husband of 60 years, Joseph A. Bongiorno on May 5, 2012; and two siblings, John Lessa and her beloved sister, Christine Poiani.

Dorothy is survived by four loving children, Joseph A. Bongiorno, Jr., Thomas F. Bongiorno and his wife Susan, Janet Higgins, and Nancy and her husband Scott Chamberlain.  She will be deeply missed by seven cherished grandchildren, Lori Bongiorno, Bethany Bongiorno, Cristina Nash, Alicia Higgins, Elliot Chamberlain, Sarah Bongiorno, and Kathryn Chamberlain; an adored great grandson, Henry Paul Nash; and a dear niece, Sheila Piegaro and her daughter Daniella Piegaro.

Relatives and friends are invited to attend a viewing at Countryside Funeral Home, 724 Route 202 North, Three Bridges, NJ 08887 on Monday, June 5 from 2-4 p.m.and 6-8 p.m. and on Tuesday, June 6 from 9:30-10:15 a.m.


Funeral services will be held on Tuesday, June 6 beginning 10:15 a.m. at the funeral home followed by an 11:00 a.m. funeral liturgy at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Roman Catholic Church in Three Bridges.  Committal words and entombment will follow at St. Magdalen Cemetery in Flemington.  Memorial contribution may be made in Dorothy’s name to the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memorial and Honor program, 505 North Parkway/Box 3704, Memphis, TN 38103.  To send condolences to the family or sign an online guest book, please visit www.CountrysideFuneralHome.com.
