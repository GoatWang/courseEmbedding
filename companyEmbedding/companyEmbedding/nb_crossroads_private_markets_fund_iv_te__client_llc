2 NB DeliverE® provides you the option of electronic delivery of account
                        statements and trade confirmations. It is a popular way of having information delivered
                        to you without having to wait for mail delivery. And, if you find account statements
                        and trade confirmations to be major sources of mailbox clutter, choosing electronic
                        delivery is an attractive alternative.
