How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Powell, Charles D carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Powell, Charles D currently holds license 17109 (Me Master Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Powell, Charles D



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Powell, Charles D



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Powell, Charles D



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

BuildZoom has one simple purpose: To help you find the perfect contractor
for any job, commercial or residential.

Education[edit]
Powell was educated at The Cathedral Choir School, Canterbury, The King's School, Canterbury and New College, Oxford, from where he graduated in 1963 with a BA in Modern History.
Diplomatic career[edit]
Charles Powell joined the Her Majesty's Diplomatic Service in 1963. His first posting was as Third Secretary to Helsinki in 1965, where he was promoted to Second Secretary. In 1968, he returned to London, spending three years at the FCO. He was posted as First Secretary to Washington, D.C. in 1971, and became the Ambassador's Private Secretary. Subsequent postings were to Bonn in 1974 and, as Counsellor, to UKREP Brussels in 1980.[2] He was seconded to 10 Downing Street and served as Private Secretary to Margaret Thatcher (1983 to 1990) and then as Private Secretary to John Major (1990 to 1991). During his time working for Mrs Thatcher, he became one of her most trusted foreign policy aides, and helped broker the controversial al-Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia.[3]
Business career[edit]
Since 1992 he has been an international businessman. Using the experience gained during his years in government, he has picked up several directorships and consultancies.[3] He is chairman of Sagitta Asset Management Limited and the luxury goods company Louis Vuitton U.K. Ltd. Prior to these positions, he was chairman of Phillips Fine Art Auctioneers and senior director of Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. He has also held directorships of Caterpillar Inc., LVMH Moet-Hennessy Louis Vuitton, Mandarin Oriental International Ltd, Schindler Holding Ltd, Tiphook plc, Textron Corporation and Yell Group plc. He is also a signatory of the Henry Jackson Society. In the arms industry, he has held advisory roles with: Rolls-Royce, Thales, BAE Systems and Textron.[4]
Brunei controversy[edit]
In 2005, it was revealed that Powell had been acting as Tony Blair's special envoy to Brunei, an unpaid role, for several years. This was controversial because Powell was on the payroll of BAE Systems, and the company was at the time in dispute with Brunei over the purchase of three warships. Lord Powell denied a conflict of interest over both his links to BAE and the fact his brother Jonathan Powell was serving as Tony Blair's chief of staff.[5]
House of Lords[edit]
He currently sits as a life peer in the House of Lords. Although associated with the Conservative Party, Lord Powell sits as a crossbench peer.
Council on Foreign Relations[edit]
Powell currently sits on the Global Board of Advisors of the Council on Foreign Relations.[6]
Personal life[edit]
He married Carla Bonardi in 1964. They have two sons, born in 1967 and 1968.
He has three brothers, Chris (co-founder of DDB Advertising Agency, and currently chair of NESTA), Roderick (Rod), and Jonathan, the Chief of Staff to Prime Minister Tony Blair, a member of the Labour Party. He pronounces his surname 'pole',[7] although his brother Jonathan pronounces his to rhyme with 'towel'.
Honours[edit]

He was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the Prime Minister's retirement honours list of December 1990.[8]
In 2001 he was awarded the Public Service Star by the government of Singapore.
He was created a life peer in the 2000 New Year Honours as Baron Powell of Bayswater, of Canterbury in the County of Kent, being Gazetted on 15 February 2000.[9]

In the media[edit]
Powell was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series Tory! Tory! Tory!.
In popular culture[edit]
Powell was portrayed by Terence Harvey in the 2004 BBC production of The Alan Clark Diaries and by James Fox in 2009's Margaret. His brother Jonathan Powell was played by Adam Godley in the 2010 TV film The Special Relationship.
