 MILLER, George Lloyd -   May 16, 1944 -June 8, 2011 Words cannot express the profound sorrow to be endured at the loss of George Lloyd Miller who lost his brave fight against cancer.  George was the eldest son of the late George and Evelyn Miller and much loved son in law of the late William and Minerva Hill. George was the ever devoted husband of Brenda Joyce and extremely proud father of Amy (Mike Millar) and his son Danny George Miller. Just as George was with his beloved Brenda, his affection was also abundantly given to his children and his pride and joys his grandchildren Jordan "Bubba" and Nicole "Miss Muffin".  His compassion, easy laugh and quick wit, and honest opinions are legendary in the family. Also left to mourn his loss are his brothers John, "the twins" Doug and Don and his sister Mary and their families as well as his brother and sister in law Jack and Carol Hill and their families. George was an intelligent, meticulous person with a keen mind for business. As a young man he followed his family tradition in the paving business and became Vice President of Brennan Paving Limited and oversaw the building of many roads through out Ontario. In 1984 George became President of Cayuga Materials where he proved to be a highly skilled, respected and popular steward of his employees and fellow workers. Our family now can only reflect on the many years of love, kindness, advice and leadership he bestowed on his family and friends both here in Canada and in Florida.  Cremation has taken place and a private ceremony for the immediate family will be held. Our everlasting gratitude to Dr. Ben Carruthers and Dr. John Rawlinson. Donations to the Carpenter Hospice would be greatly appreciated.10214120

        George Lloyd  Miller
    





 MILLER, George Lloyd -   May 16, 1944 -June 8, 2011 Words cannot express the profound sorrow to be endured at the loss of George Lloyd Miller who lost his brave fight against cancer.  George was the eldest son of the late George and Evelyn Miller and much loved son in law of the late William and Minerva Hill. George was the ever devoted husband of Brenda Joyce and extremely proud father of Amy (Mike Millar) and his son Danny George Miller. Just as George was with his beloved Brenda, his affection was also abundantly given to his children and his pride and joys his grandchildren Jordan "Bubba" and Nicole "Miss Muffin".  His compassion, easy laugh and quick wit, and honest opinions are legendary in the family. Also left to mourn his loss are his brothers John, "the twins" Doug and Don and his sister Mary and their families as well as his brother and sister in law Jack and Carol Hill and their families. George was an intelligent, meticulous person with a keen mind for business. As a young man he followed his family tradition in the paving business and became Vice President of Brennan Paving Limited and oversaw the building of many roads through out Ontario. In 1984 George became President of Cayuga Materials where he proved to be a highly skilled, respected and popular steward of his employees and fellow workers. Our family now can only reflect on the many years of love, kindness, advice and leadership he bestowed on his family and friends both here in Canada and in Florida.  Cremation has taken place and a private ceremony for the immediate family will be held. Our everlasting gratitude to Dr. Ben Carruthers and Dr. John Rawlinson. Donations to the Carpenter Hospice would be greatly appreciated.10214120

MILLER APPLICATION # 10448 

George A. Lloyd 
Rome, GA 

It does not appear that claimants are connected with the �Water Hunter� on rolls of 1835.  The ancestors of claimants belonged to the McIntosh Tribe of Creek Indians.  They show no real connection with Eastern Cherokee.  It further does not appear that any ancestor was party to treaties of 1835-6 or 1846.   They are recognized as white people.

(As to Creek-See Exception ��)

Dear Madam:
  Enclosed herewith please find a copy of the �Special Master�s Report # 105, of Judge Springer�s Court, which was appealed from the Commission of the Five Civilized Tribes�.

The contention of the appellee, that we failed to show that our ancestors through whom we claim, were ever recognized as citizens of the Cherokee Nation, since it�s removal West, will say in reply none of those ancestors, Susan Lloyd, nee Parsons, Samuel Parsons and Water Hunter, Never moved West, but lived and died in the Old Cherokee Nation; but Peter Parsons, who makes one of the affidavits mentions herein, is a Nephew of said Samuel Parsons, and he and his family and mother were all recognized as citizens of the Cherokee Nation and were on the roll and drew money at Tahlequah.

My father, George A. Lloyd, and family moved from Georgia, in spring of 1872; and in the fall of the same year, he put in his application before the council, at Tahlequah; all of which goes to show it was not neglect or any fault of his that we were not recognized as citizens of the Cherokee Nation.

Most of the claimants of the Citizenship Association, claim that the Commission were bought by the appellee, and that they did not have a fair and impartial trial; that their evidence was treated with contempt.

All the Council required the claimants to prove, was that they were Cherokees by Blood, and we did that.  It is true our property was appraised and its value tendered, but we rejected it on the grounds that we still had a right to keep our homes,  I have not received and compensation for the same up to the present time.

W. J. Watts was our local attorney when the case was before the Council and filed with them all of our affidavits and evidence.  I think they have the name of Water Hunter spelled �Walter� which is a mistake.  Would be glad to give you any information I possibly can and to hear from you any time as to the progress you are making.

  Very Truly your, 
  Minnie Evans, per John Evans (Signed John Evens)

Dear Madam:
Enclosed herewith, you will find application of William Washington Lloyd and Minnie May Evans, nee Lloyd, duly signed and and executed.

               -----------------------0000 Remarks 0000--------------------

  My Father came to the Cherokee Nation, Indian Territory, and from the state of Georgia in the year 1872, and put his claim in before the Council, but they put him off from time to time, and he continued to gather his proof from year to year and to go before the Council up to the time he died, in the year 1884.

   After his death, my mother sister and brothers, continued to press the claim, and appear before the Council, until 1896, when the Dawes Commission was appointed to final settlement between the Indians and the Claimants.

  Our proofs were gotten up in due form and sent in to the Dawes Commission, but it being prejudice against the claimants, they did not as much as open the envelope containing the proofs not only of our claim but the did hundreds of others in the same way; in other words they had the case decided before the proof was ever put in.

  We took an appeal from the Dawes Commission, through our attorney, Jeff Watts, in the fall or Spring of 1896 or 7� to Judge Springer�s Court, at Muskogee, I. T.  who examined our proof and decided, that my father was a Cherokee by Blood, but said he did not have the jurisdiction to say that we should be enrolled as citizens.  We have the Master and Chancery Report of his court, but it is with some of my brothers or sisters; and I am endeavouring to find out which one has it and as soon as I locate it, I will send it to you.

   Mother says father often told her he remembered when he was a boy of about eight or nine years old, going with his mother, Susan Lloyd nee Parsons, to Old Eddy Ware�s, Indian Agent for the Cherokees, which was located near Rome, Georgia; for the purpose of drawing supplies; which was about the year 1828.

  Water Hunter, by great-great-grandfather on my father�s side, lived at a place called Old Pine Log, which was about fifteen miles East of Dalton, Georgia; near the line between Tennessee and Georgia.

   Myself, (Minnie May Evans, nee Lloyd), Edith Evans nee Lloyd, William Washington Lloyd, now living and Mary M. Lloyd, and Jesse N. Lloyd both dead, are the children of Mary A. Lloyd, nee Wanslee, (My father�s second wife) and the balance of the children are from my father�s first wife, (Jane Lloyd nee Turner)

Misc. Testimony for Miller Application # 10448

   Wilson Monroe Shrepshire being duly sworn in behalf of George A. Loyd, deposes and says�.

  That I am 88 years of age and live in Floyd County, Georgia.  I knew Thomas Loyd and his wife, grandparents of applicant.  Got acquainted with them about 1840.  They were then living south of Rome, Georgia about three miles.  I suppose they had been here five or six years when I got acquainted with them.  I think they came from N.C. but I don�t know what part.  I have just heard this. He lived with the Indians right here in this country,  Floyd County, GA.  He was recognized as having Indian blood but I don�t know whether he took part in Indian Councils or not.  He claimed to be � Cherokee Indian,  I don�t know how much Indian Blood the wife of Thomas Loyd claimed.  They had a farm here at that time.  They had been living on the farm when I came here.  There were not a great many Indians here when I came.  I never heard of Thomas Loyd or his wife being on any roll,  all I know is that there were recognized as having Indian Blood by the whites and by the  Indians.  I know George Loyd who went to the Territory.  He was the son of old Thomas Loyd.

Misc. Testimony for Miller Application # 10448

George A. Loyd being duly sworn, deposes and says:

That I am 56 years of age and live in Floyd County, Georgia.  I claim through my father; my mother was a full blood white woman.  My father�s mother claimed Indian.  My grandfather on my father�s side was full blooded white man.  Susan Loyd died in 1866.  Her grandfather was a full blooded Cherokee Indian;  She was about �.  Her Grandfather�s Indian name was Water Hunter.  Don�t know when he died-haven�t any idea.  Susan Loyd�s father was S. D. Parson: he was � Blood.  I am about 1/16 Cherokee.  I think my father was never on any rolls.  I don�t know whether his mother was or not.  My father was born in Coweta County, Georgia.  He moved to Floyd County, Georgia in 1835 or 1836.  He lived amongst the Indian in Coweta County, but I don�t know whether he lived with them as a member of the tribe.  I don�t think the Indians were in Floyd County when my father came here.  My grandmother Loyd came with him when he came to this country.  This is the only application I ever made for Indian benefits.  My grandfather first moved to Fayette County, Georgia., then he went to Coweta County.  My grandfather and grandmother lived with the McIntosh tribe in Coweta County or Fayette County, Georgia.  They were a Creek Tribe.  I think my grandfather Loyd came from SC , am not sure, however. I have an uncle, a brother of my father ,George W. Loyd- and he went to the Territory about 1870.  He came from Floyd County, Georgia.  While out there he made application for a porting of land being allotted tot he Cherokees.  He came back here about 1878 to get evidence attempting to prove his Indian Blood.  The last record I have of the claim it was turned over to the Dawes Commission.  Don�t know when it was submitted to them.  It was about 1896. I here have a paper entitled in the U.S. Court, Indian Territory, Northern District, at Muskogee, I. T. , John G. Loyd, et al vs. the Cherokee Nation, which is an application made by my uncle and other immediate member of his family and reciting the proceedings had therein for the purpose of securing land and enrollment amongst the Five Civilized Tribes in I. T. and the same is here marked Exhibit �A� and attached as a pert of my testimony.  Charles A. Loyd and Mary Jane Stafford are cousins of mine, they being the children of Jasper Loyd and claim through the same source as I and through no other source.  I here also offer in evidence an affidavit made by James T. Pullen, Sr., made in behalf of my sister and marked Exhibit �B�, which my said sister, Nora Loyd, had obtained when she was about to go to Texas in 1896 and which was gotten with the view of making application out West for Indian benefits in the Cherokee Nation but she never filed her claim or did anything further with it.

 Exhibit �A�
In the United States Court in the Indian Territory, Northern District, Muskogee, I. T.

  John G. Lloyd et al.,
              Vs
  The Cherokee Nation

   I, N. A. Gibson, Special Master, herein show to, the Court that under the general order herein, I have examined the proof and pleading in this case, which are herewith  made a part of this report, and that I find as follows:

                                                            1st

  That this case was instituted on September 8th, 1896, before the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, and the application denied on November 4th, 1896, and on December 28th, 1896, the parties appealed from said decision to this court.

  That the application was made by John G. Lloyd, William W. Lloyd, Minnie T. Lloyd, Edith A. Brady and Josephine Barthell, the children of Dr. George W. Lloyd, deceased, and by Mary A. Lloyd, the wife of said Dr. George W. Lloyd.

  That the parties reside at McFall, Indian Territory, where they have lived for nineteen years.  That they file in support of their application the affidavits of Mary A. Lloyd, J. N. Wimpee, Joseph M. Morris, Peter Parson, Elizabeth Morris, Martha Mullenax, John Ross Thomas, J. Gattis, Nathan W. Wanslee, Gideon F. Morris, Green B. Kite, and Thomas Lumpkin; and a certificate from W. J. Watts showing a copy of the family record of George W. Lloyd, deceased.

                                                          2nd

  That the testimony in this case consists principally of copies of affidavits presented to the Cherokee Commission on Citizenship, known as the Chambers Court, in the year 1870, at which time Dr. G. W. Lloyd made application for himself and family to said Commission which application was rejected.  That these claimants are the children of G. W. Lloyd, deceased, who was the son of Susan Lloyd, who was the daughter of Samuel Parsons, who was the son of Water Hunter, who is said to be a Cherokee Indian by Blood.

                                                         3rd

  The defendant files the proceedings of the said Citizenship Court in the year 1879, including the testimony filed and the decision of the Commission rejecting Dr. Lloyd and his family.

                                                          4th

   The claimants contend that under the showing that they are descended from Samuel Parsons and Walter Hunter, who were known to be Cherokee Indians by blood, they are entitled to admission to citizenship of the Cherokee Nation as citizens by blood; while the appellee contends that by reasons of the claimants failing to show that the ancestors through whom they claim have ever been recognized as citizens of the Cherokee Nation since its removal West; and furtherly, by reason of the fact that the claimants have heretofore made application to the Cherokee Commission on Citizenship for admission to the Cherokee Nation, and have been rejected, and that by Act of Congress of March the 3rd, 1893, they have been declared �intruders� and their property appraised and its value tendered them, these claimants are barred from being admitted to citizenship in the Cherokee Nation.

   The premises considered, I find that the claimants are the descendants of Samuel Parsons and Water Hunter, that they are Cherokee Indians by blood, and reside in the Cherokee Nation; that they have heretofore applied to the regularly constituted Commission of the Cherokee Nation for admission to the Cherokee Nation as citizens by blood, and have been rejected by said Commission; that they have been declared intruders and the value of their improvements tendered them by the proper authorities, and that they do not show that the ancestors through whom they claim were ever enrolled as  citizens of the Cherokee Nation.

   I respectfully ask that the Court allow me a reasonable fee of my services herein. 
  Respectfully submitted this first day of July 1897.

                                                 N. A. Gibson, Special master

I hereby certify that the within is a true copy of the original Report of the Special Master in Chancery.
