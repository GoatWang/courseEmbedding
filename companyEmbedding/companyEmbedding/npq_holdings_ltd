The amounts actually spent for any specific purpose may vary and will depend on
a number of factors. Non-fixed cost, sales and marketing and general and
administrative costs may vary with business progress and development efforts,
general business conditions and market reception. Accordingly, our management
has broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds to non-fixed costs.

An example of changes to this spending allocation for non-fixed costs include
management deciding to spend less of the allotment on product development and
more on sales and marketing.

If insufficient funds are raised we plan to use cash on hand, or if necessary,
borrow funds from our management.


1. Enterprise Mobile App

There are many mobile app and custom software developers in the market. They
essentially develop highly customized enterprise applications at a price range
between $100,000 to $500,000. The high pricing resulted in many Small & Medium
Enterprises (SMEs) not being able to afford their solutions.

As each mobile app project is highly customized, the developer has to build the
mobile app from scratch, resulting in long development time. Furthermore, there
are no significant recurring revenues from such custom mobile app projects. This
makes their business model difficult to scale as each project is unique.

Some of these notable players in Singapore and Malaysia include Rainmaker Labs
and Codigo.

2. Mobile Point-Of-Sale for Restaurants

We face competition from both mature traditional Point-Of-Sale (POS) providers
and new mobile POS players.

a) Traditional POS

They have established market share, mature hardware and software. They are the
de facto choice when new F&B outlets open for business. However, these
traditional POS systems run on expensive proprietary hardware and are at best a
cash register. Such traditional POS systems are difficult to integrate with
other business software such as CRM, loyalty program, accounting and inventory
management software.

Traditional POS deployments account for almost 90% of all POS deployment in
Singapore and Malaysia. Some established players in this segment include e-Point
POS and Raptor POS.

b) iPad e-Menu Ordering Systems

These solutions enable customers to self-order via an iPad, thus reducing the
need for a waiter to take orders. The cost of deployment can be high as there is
a need to deploy one iPad per table. During operations, spillage from soups and
drinks can damage these devices, resulting in high ongoing replacement and
maintenance costs.

These solutions are not connected to the cloud and hence cannot process online
takeaway orders. Running on proprietary software also makes it difficult to
integrate such solutions with other business software.

One of the notable players in this segment is a startup called Tabsquare.

c) iPad POS

iPad POS players is rapidly capturing market share from traditional POS players.
Low cost of adoption coupled with readily available consumer grade hardware
(iPad and routers) are the key drivers to this migration.

However, these solutions, while innovative, are difficult to integrate with
other business software. Most does not offer processing of orders from
customer’s mobile phones and are not integrated with Kitchen Display System.

The leading player globally for iPad POS for restaurants is Revel POS.


Company Description
We are a development stage company with no earnings to date and operations and
assets consistent with our age, with a focus on early-stage business activities
such as proof of concept, development, and promotion of enterprise mobile
applications and mobile Point-Of-Sale technologies.

NPQ Holdings


 Limited is a company that operates through its wholly owned
subsidiary, NPQ Global Limited, a Company organized in Anguilla under the
International Business Companies Act, 2000. It should be noted that our wholly
owned subsidiary, NPQ Global Limited owns 100% of NPQ (HK) Limited, a Hong Kong
Company.

At this time we operate exclusively through our wholly owned subsidiary and
share the same business plan of our subsidiary, which is the consultancy and
development of enterprise mobile applications and mobile Point-Of-Sale system.
NPQ Global Limited also shares the same business plan of NPQ Holdings Limited.

Our business and operations are focused on development of enterprise mobile
applications and mobile point-of-sales systems. Our mission is to be the leading
provider of cloud applications for businesses, by empowering partners with
rewarding business opportunities and a passion to help businesses succeed.

NPQ focuses on the development of solutions for two large industry segments
below.

1. Enterprise Mobile Apps

NPQ focuses on development of solutions that integrate front-end mobile
applications with back-end cloud-based enterprise software, enabling businesses
to deliver complex business services to customers and facilitate complex 
workflow to support employees via mobile devices. Customers are better served
while mobile workers are empowered to perform their work more effectively,
through easy-to-use mobile applications with intuitive user interface that
delivers the required services powered by cloud-based enterprise software.

2. Mobile Point-Of-Sale (mPOS) for Restaurants

Restaurants face challenges with managing resources, business costs, and 
manpower amidst keen competition. To sustain growth and profitability, many must
leverage on technology and innovation to improve productivity, operational
efficiency and appeal to affluent customers of today. Traditional POS systems
consist of a basic computer, barcode scanner, receipt printer, cash drawer, and
card reader for debit or credit transactions. A Mobile Point-Of-Sale (mPOS) is a
smartphone, tablet or dedicated wireless device that performs the functions of a
cash register or electronic point-of-sale terminal. mPOS systems are easier to
use, more affordable, more versatile and can be linked up via tablet or 
smartphone with data synchronized in real-time to the cloud.

NPQ has completed the development of two products: SoLoMo App and NPQ Restaurant
Management System. SoLoMo App is our enterprise mobile app development service
while NPQ Restaurant Management System is a cloud-based mPOS solution for 
restaurants. We are pre-revenue and have fully functional products that are
ready to go-to-market. Our development plan estimates six months to start 
generating revenue from these products. The development plan includes:
 
a. Acquiring paying clients for NPQ RMS and SoLoMo App at a discounted price for
   pilot trial

b. Deploying NPQ RMS and SoLoMo App for the pilot clients and ironing out any
   technical issues and bugs

c. Hiring and training sales and marketing team

NPQ will initially focus on the Singapore market. We are targeting the segment
of smaller restaurants, who are likely to be using only a standalone POS system
and can benefit the most from a fully integrated NPQ Restaurant Management
System. NPQ intends to market its products through a team of authorized 
independent commission-based sales partners, as well as a full-time sales team.
We plan to have 10 authorized sales partners and 5 full-time sales persons to
cover Singapore and Malaysia markets.
---

Furthermore, the market for enterprise mobile apps and mobile point-of-sale is
fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive, with relatively low
barriers to entry for certain applications and services. Many of our competitors
and potential competitors are larger and have greater name recognition, much
longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and significantly greater
resources than we do.

NPQ Holdings Limited was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 9, 2015.
Our executive offices are located at 190 Toa Payoh Lorong 6 #02-514, Singapore
310190. Telephone number: +65 6681 6667. E-mail: Info@npqholdings.com.

NPQ Holdings Ltd (NPQ)’s Initial Public Offering (IPO)

Thank you for your investment in the pre-IPO shares of NPQ Holdings Ltd (NPQ). NPQ aimed to be the leading provider of Enterprise Apps for SMEs, by empowering partners with rewarding business opportunities and a passion to help businesses succeed.

The road to an IPO has been challenging and rewarding one. After months of hard work of getting the company audited by a license auditor approved by the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), preparation and filing of  S1 (Prospectus) documents and answering queries and comments from SEC, NPQ has finally obtained the S1 effective from the SEC on 13 February 2017.
As you may know, Form S-1 is an SEC filing used by companies planning on going public to register their securities with the SEC under the “registration statement by the Securities Act of 1933”.  This is definitely a great milestones for the company as we will officially offer our IPO to the public at $1 per share and we expect to obtain the company trading symbol within the coming few months in order to start share trading activity.
Enclosed is the SEC website indicating that NPQ is IPO effective, you may access all detailed information at https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?company=NPQ+Holdings+Ltd+&owner=exclude&action=getcompany
