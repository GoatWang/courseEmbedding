Blow Away Your Competition by Replacing Your Old CRM Program with the New Customer Relevant Relationship Management (CRRM) Model – Part 2: The Necessary Components.


March 18, 2012
4 Comments






1) Introduction:

In my previous blog, I covered what the new Customer Relevant Relationship Model (CRRM) is and the benefits of adopting this new model. In this blog, I will cover the components of the new CRRM model and what you need to put in place to make this new model a reality.


Ever wonder why companies like ESPN, Apple, Google, Zynga, Amazon, and Marriott dominate their respective markets? The reason is that they are ‘Customer First’ organizations and are passionate about listening to, understanding and then delighting their customers based on leveraging true customer insights. They treat their customers as business partners vs. commodities and include them in many critical decision making processes. They get this new CRRM model. Why/how ? – Read the rest of this blog to find out…


The differences between the old CRM model and how these companies are embracing the newer CRRM model are depicted in the following chart:

The Old CRM Model vs. New CRRM Model – Customers as Business Partners
2) Customers are fed up with old Dictatorial Management Style & Want to be Empowered as Business Partners
Customers and stakeholders today are longing for a company to partner with them and include them in the corporate decision making process.  These same constituencies are sick and tired of political, corporate, and other organizations making unilateral decisions for them that are really not in-line with their needs,  wants, etc. The backlash from this unwanted dictatorial management style of some companies can be seen in the Bank of America fee customer rebellion, the customer backlash from Netflix deciding to  split their company without first consulting with their customers and HPs initial decision to exit the computer market.
3) Components of the New CRRM Model:
In order to progress your organization from the old CRM model to the new CRRM  model, a few key essentials must be put in place and are as follows:
A. New CRRM Model that includes the 360° Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights.  This model enables a 360° view of all customer and market insights including customer feedback, preferences, likes, dislikes, social sentiment, competitor activity, etc. This new model takes your insights to an entirely new level whereby you are now enabled to delight customers, stakeholders and stockholders by having insights that are light-years ahead of insights provided by a traditional CRM model.

B. Customer First Culture driven by management that is passionate about their customers including a set of customer first principles and guidelines developed by company leaders

C. Customer Ratings & Feedback Structure that will identify areas where you will collect customer 360° feedback from customer and stakeholder interactions

D. Customer Feedback & Preferences Cultivation Process and corresponding infrastructure in order to allow your customers to continually rate how well you are serving them

E. Customer Health Scorecard that provides real-time insights on how well the customers, stakeholders and stockholders perceives you as serving them as well as insights into a Continuous Customer Improvement Process (CCIP) that enables you to continually improve your customer perceptions, satisfaction, brand loyalty, etc.
These components can apply to large enterprises as well as Small to Medium Businesses (SMBs).
The following graphics are all sample components from the list above (A-D) that need to be put in place to enable this new CRRM Model.


New CRRM Model – 360° Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights


 3A) The above chart “New CRRM Model – 360 Cultivation of Customer & Market Insights” demonstrates the new insights model that must be put in place to deliver world-class stakeholder and customer programs. 
These enhanced insights will enable you to deliver products and services that delight your customers, stakeholders and stockholders as well as enable you to leapfrog the competition in terms of market share if they continue to rely on their antiquated CRM data and analytics insights only model.  
For Small to Medium sized Businesses (SMBs), some of the insights do not apply, but the following charts (3B-3E) most certainly apply and can be tracked via simple Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.



CRRM Customer First Policies & Organizational Principles
3B) The above chart “CRRM Organizational Guiding Principles” demonstrates the principles that must be in-place to be customer first culture. This culture is driven by management that is passionate about their customers and governs the company around a set of customer first policies.
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Rating & Feedback Structure
3C) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Rating & Feedback Structure” illustrates a sample structure (will vary for each type of business) whereby customer feedback and preferences will be cultivated in order to develop 360° insights into customer needs, wants, likes, etc.
Enterprise CRRM Customer Feedback & Preferences Cultivation Process
3D) The above chart “CRRM Customer Ratings & Feedback Cultivation Process” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences will be cultivated in order to develop 360° insights into customer needs, wants, likes, etc.
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Ratings Visualization
3E) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Ratings Visualization” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences ratings will be visually represented in a scorecard. 
Sample Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard Metrics
3E-2) The above chart “Enterprise CRRM Customer Scorecard” illustrates a how customer feedback and preferences ratings will be rolled up into an analytical scorecard that provides insights into customer trends,  customer feedback, customer issues, core customer strengths and weaknesses, etc. 
This scorecard can also be used to manage a Continuous Customer Improvement Process (CCIP) that continually drives improvements to customer perceptions, ratings, satisfaction, etc. 
Sample Scorecard for “Shopping Experience”
The above depicts how analytics and metrics would be maintained for a business who had a retail or wholesale shopping function.
Sample Shopping Experience Scorecard – #2
Robust Scorecard Analytics and Metrics should support Customer Trend Identification and Root Cause Analysis for Customer Issues.
Sample Branding & Public Relations Scorecard
Sample Public Relations Scorecard Above gives you insights into how well your company and brands are perceived by customers, stakeholders, stockholders, etc. 
Sample Customer Service Scorecard
Sample Customer Scorecard Above from Customer Service tells how well you are serving your customers.
Sample Marketing Scorecard
Sample Marketing Scorecard Above Gives you insights into how well your Marketing Efforts are resonating with your customers.
Sample Product Management Scorecard
The Sample Product Management Scorecard above gives you insights into how well perceived your products and services are with customers and prospects.
4) Company & Customer Benefits of Adopting the CRRM Model:
By treating customers as business partners (vs. commodities) and including them in the corporate decision making process, as well as allowing them to rate how well you are serving them from an array of customer facing areas, companies can reap huge rewards including the following:
1. Better insights into the types of products and services customers want & need
2. Fiercely loyal customers who feel part of the corporate team
3. Customers who are most likely to spend more, be retained longer and purchase at premium prices with higher profit margins
4. Customers who are very likely to be brand advocates and refer others to your company, brands, and services.
5. Customers who feel connected to the company and empowered to improve company operations
The following are actual customer comments from those who have participated in a customer feedback program to help shape products & services:
“I feel like xyz company cares about me since they ask my opinion”
“Finally a company that listens to us”
“It is so refreshing to have a company ask you your opinions on products and services vs. ramming something down our throats that we don’t like”
“Wow – this is fun. I enjoy providing my opinion”
“As silly as this might sound, xyz company is the only company that ever asked me what I wanted”
“In my opinion, xyz company is much more progressive than their competitors by seeking consumer opinions, what matters to them, etc. 
 5) Conclusion:
More dynamic companies like Goodle, Zynga, Amazon, etc. are inviting customers to become part of the corporate decision making process and empowering them to provide feedback, insights and rate company operations in order to drive continous customer improvements. Companies who adopt this new CRRM model whereby company management is democratized by including stakeholders and customers into the decision making process will reap the rewards of ever higher customer acquisition, retention and spend – leading to ever higher profits and share price.

Blow Away Your Competition by Replacing Your Old CRM Program with the New Customer Relevant Relationship Management (CRRM) Model


January 29, 2012

Blow Away Your Competition by Replacing Your Old CRM Program with a more effective Customer Relevant Relationship Management (CRRM) Model

1)               Introduction


Do you have a robust CRM program in-place, but you feel you are still missing the mark in terms of delivering what your customers really want & need?
Is your organization at risk of making market decisions that can cause a backlash and mass defection by your customers like the Bank of America $5 fee decision or the Netflix business split decision?
Do you have volumes of consumer data and analytics, but sales are declining or flat and customers are churning at an increasing rate?
Do you feel you could improve the quantity and quality of your customer insights including ascertaining critical consumer needs, preferences, likes/dislikes, interests, preferred communication channel for you to contact them, preferred timing and frequency for you to communicate with them, etc?

If you can say “Yes” to any of these questions, the rest of this post is a MUST READ for you and it is time to consider this more effective CRRM Model to replace your outdated CRM Model.
2)               CRM vs. CRRM Model Overview
The following diagram depicts the major differences between the old CRM Model and the new CRRM Model including the problems associated with the old CRM model and benefits of the newer CRRM model. 
Old CRM Model vs. Customer Relevant Relationship Management (CRRM)
Old CRM Model (left above): 

Relies on historical data and analytics to determine what customers need, want, etc. by the analysis of sales history, types of products purchased, categories of products purchased, views on websites, stores visited, etc.
Customer activity information is a proxy to what customers really want and need. Example, you will seldom learn that a customer hates an in-store or web experience through this proxy for what they are wanting, feeling, needing, disliking, etc.
Companies are unlikely to gain insights into the impact that any future company decisions will have on customer loyalty, retention, acquisition.

New CRRM Model (right above): 

Takes a more direct approach with customers and utilizes a systemic querying method to ascertain exactly what customer want/need/prefer/etc.
Embraces customer councils, customer forums, customer voting to drive future content, interactions, product/service offerings, etc.
Activity solicits ratings from customers on many aspects (marketing materials, web experience, in-store experience, product usability, quality of customer service, etc.) regarding the health of the overall customer relationship and continually asks “How well are we managing our relationship”

3)               Example of CRM Model Gaps 
To illustrate how companies are struggling to really determine the real needs of their customers, I took selected comments from interactions with senior CRM executives from major US Corporations based on consulting engagements, job interviews, speaking to them in passing, etc. The following charts are their actual verbatim comments as well as my read on their CRM gap that prevents them from developing world-class relationships with their customers.




Traditional CRM Programs: 

Organizational culture, operations, and go-to-market strategy does not put the customer and real customer insights into the center of CRM operations
Relies on data, analytics, and customer history to drive on-going customer interactions. 
Puts the organization at extreme risk of missing the boat from a customer’s perspective – real needs, wants, concerns, preferences, experiences, etc. 
Companies that rely on this model are at-risk of customer defections, decreased customer spend/loyalty, etc. 

New CRRM Model – with Customers In The Center of Customer Operations
New CRRM Program:

The organizational culture, operations, and go-to-market strategy puts the customer and real customer insights into the center of CRM operations rather than rely on the proxies of what customers want, i.e. data, analytics, and customer history. 
The customer becomes the actual judge, ‘rater’ of whether you are delivering quality, value and a good relationship to them. 
The customer is put in charge of CRM operations and enables a bi-directional and on-going dialog with the customer whereby they tell you their real needs, wants, concerns, preferences, experiences, etc.
Companies that rely on this model are more likely to develop products, services, offers, communications that delight the customer and whereby they are more loyal, greater brand advocates, and likely to refer your company to their friends as a company who listens, cares and empowers their customers. 






6)             Companies That ‘Get ‘CRRM
The following are samples of companies that, in my opinion, get the CRRM model and details how/why each of them get this new go-to-market customer model. 
Companies That ‘Get’ CRRM – 1 of 2

Companies That Get CRRM – 2 of 2
Phrases That Describe Companies who ‘Get’ the New CRRM Model


We don’t hide behind data and analytics to drive our customer & CRM operations, but rather we ask our customers what they want. 
We are eager to ask our most disgruntled customers how we can improve our relationship with them and to determine who to improve our go-to-market strategy
Before we make any major market-facing decisions, we ask a cross-segment of our customers what they think about each of our proposed decisions and then ask them how to improve upon how these changes are implemented so we ensure a continued delighted customer base. 

The bottom line of this post is that, if your company relies less on historical data and analytics to determine what customer want and actually builds methods, processes, and systems to put the customer in charge of rating CRM operations in order to provide you with ongoing and valuable real insights (needs, wants, likes dislikes, preferences, concerns, etc.), the customers will feel more valued and connected with your brands. The benefit of adopting this new CRRM model will be more loyal, empowered and delighted customers who will be brand advocates and brand referrers that will increase shareholder and company value.
As I have now built this new CRRM model for several major US brands, my next blog post will be on ‘how to’ develop this capability at the enterprise level.

By visiting the properties within his family’s hotel empire, David Marriott stresses community to carry on the Marriott brand.

ASHBURN, Virginia—Born to the hotel life, David Marriott fits right in at the SpringHill Suites Ashburn in this northern Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C. In April, Marriott visited the property to pump up the troops, shaking the hand of each member of a group of Marriott associates gathered in the lobby of this fresh, select-service hotel, the only building with an identifying sign in an area slowly becoming a new city center.
“I feel like I started with the company the day they put a diaper on me,” the boyish scion of the storied Marriott brand told the group, seated in one of two circular “communal centers” in the lobby. 
As COO of Marriott International’s Americas Eastern Region, Marriott, 36, leads 220 hotels stretching from South Carolina to Maine to West Virginia, including 150 select-service properties and 10 Ritz-Carltons. As of that Thursday 1 April, he had been in the job for only 90 days. 








As COO of Marriott International's Americas Eastern Region, David Marriott makes it a point to greet the company's associates in person.




Meeting the people
“You’ve gone through a lot in the last 18 months,” Marriott said, his communication easy-going, his manner far more relaxed than his attire. What’s key to success in hospitality, he said, is “genuine care for people,” making sure family relationships are strong, and “day in and day out, you’re giving your all.”
He said Marriott is in a good position as the world emerges from recession. Marriott also noted that his favorite destination is Camelback Inn Resort & Spa in Scottsdale, Arizona, the Marriott spread where he and his family recently visited his father, 78-year-old J.W. (Bill) Marriott Jr., and Bill’s wife, Donna. Bill Marriott has spent 42 birthdays at the Scottsdale landmark, which is where David and his wife, Carey, became engaged.
The youngest of four children, Marriott ran global sales for Marriott for four years, decentralizing the operation into regional sales offices, until January, when he assumed his new position. Still acclimating to the greater responsibilities, he was leery about discussing whether he someday will take over for his father as leader of the company, but the question is inevitable. Debbie Marriott Harrison, the oldest child, is senior VP of government affairs for Marriott. Stephen, the next oldest, is executive VP of culture. John runs JW Marriott Family Enterprises. That leaves David, the one Marriott other than Bill with his hands—literally—on hotels.
In his talk with associates, Marriott said SpringHill Suites is “beautifully positioned” for business in the downturn and later; Ritz-Carlton had a really difficult 2009 but is getting back on track; the full-service J.W. Marriott brand is becoming more relevant to the business traveler; and the timing was bad to debut Edition and Nickelodeon, respectively a luxury boutique hotel and a family resort.
But he stressed the silver lining. 
“We’ve had a lot of really good learnings in the last year-and-a-half,” Marriott said, predicting robust growth in India, as well as China, where Marriott expects to open 30 hotels during the next two years (there are 40 already there).
Casual charisma
In an interview after the gathering, Marriott said he spends his day on reports from VPs responsible for Ritz-Carltons, the C-Res (Courtyard and Residence) hotels, and for larger markets including New York City, where Marriott will launch a renovation of the 2,000-room Marriott Marquis at the end of the year. Other imminent renovations: the 1,400-room Philadelphia Marriott Downtown and the 1,100-room Marriott Copley Place in Boston. Marriott visits GMs to “talk through their challenges” and attempts to make sure owners are “investing in the product and staying on top of their renovation schedules.” 
The hardest thing about the new job? 
“Finding the appropriate balance to pay attention to the competing priorities” issuing from customers, associates, owners and ownership groups. “I’m still learning about the job.” 
Did he want the job? 
“Absolutely,” he said. “Whenever you go into a big job, it feels overwhelming at times, but it’s a tremendous opportunity and I’m really enjoying it so far.”
He called his management style “really collaborative. If you ask my team, they would say I’m always looking for ideas and trying to create an environment where there’s a free flow of ideas.”
 Early in his new post, he organized a two-day retreat with an outside facilitator “to talk about what makes a high-performing team and what our priorities would be.” 
Trust was a hot topic: It’s not always easy to share things with your boss, particularly when the boss has the last name of Marriott.








David Marriott shares thoughts about hotels with Marriott associates.




‘Extended family’ 
While no member of the Marriott family would comment on David, his boss did. 
“His brother, John, introduced me to him when he was still in college,” recalled David Grissen, president of the Americas, Marriott International. “He handles himself extremely well, given he’s a younger guy. When I tour hotels with him, it’s kind of fun … He’s just charming with the associates, he’s kind of iconic. You walk in, the place is abuzz, the hourly staff, the housekeepers, the line staff in the kitchen, they just pop to attention.
“We’re kind of unique in the industry in that we have someone with their name on the building walk into the hotel. There isn’t a Mr. Starwood, and the Hiltons are kind of gone.”
Is it uncomfortable being his boss? 
“There’s no downside,” Grissen said. “The biggest downside would be if Mr. Marriott found out I didn’t give David constructive feedback and criticism; that’s when he might decide to find a new president of the Americas.” 
David hasn’t had a development or finance role in the company or as much operations experience as some other Marriott executives, Grissen suggested, so he needs “exposure to the right areas.” He has conversations in which he asks David to list “three things that you go home and lose sleep over because you don’t know,” then work on them. 
“He’s going to build out his experience and credibility and business skills,” Grissen said, “but the one thing I think he’s a natural at it is a leader. He’s wonderful on stage, he’s got great platform skills … he’s genuine, he’s articulate, he speaks well, and he speaks from the heart.”
David “is a very normal guy,” Grissen said. “He’s got a very balanced head on his shoulders for someone who grew up in the Marriott family. You could end up very different, not a roll-up-your-sleeves kind of person. He truly appreciates a lot of what we’ve built as a company from a culture standpoint—our associates mean a lot to us and he gets that.”
Associates view their co-workers as “extended family,” Marriott said.
“I think it’s critical, particularly now, that that culture continues to grow and be strong. You look at our turnover, it’s extremely low. Look at our tenure, it’s extremely high. Our GMs are generally 20- to 25-year associates with the company, and the number of executives we have that are 30-plus years is unheard of.
“There’s a lot of people unemployed right now, more than in years,” he said. “We want to make sure we hold on to the best talent and attract the best talent, make sure the people we hire have a passion for this industry,” a field of hard work and long hours. 
 
“I’ve always believed you live in the moment and do the best you can with what you have on your plate,” Marriott said. “If you do that, the other things will take care of themselves. If my family life isn’t successful and happy to me, the rest of it, who really cares?”
Known as a huge Grateful Dead fan, Marriott abandons his BlackBerry on weekends. “It’s all about the kids when I’m not working, and it’s all about my wife, trying to carve out a couple of hours a week for ourselves.”

He probably said CRST (which stands for Courtyard, Residence Inn, SpringHill Suites, and TownPlace Suites) not C-Res.

David was a key speaker at our recent Town Hall meeting in Charlotte NC.  He was charismatic, interesting, and humble when answering his fathers questions.  I'm proud to have the Marriott family as my employer.

I have worked at Marriott's reservations contact center for the past 6 years and I must say it is a pretty good company to work for. I love the people I work with and that helps a lot to relieve some of the tediousness that come with repetitive nature of the job.
