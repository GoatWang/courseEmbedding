This woman has been given the job of merging Yahoo with AOL

Marni
  Walden.
Reuters




  When Verizon announced its $4.83
  billion deal to acquire Yahoo on Monday, it also highlighted
  one of its longtime executives.


  Marni Walden has taken on the job of merging Yahoo with AOL,
  which
  Verizon bought for $4.4 billion last year.


  As Verizon's executive vice president and president of product
  innovation, Walden is in charge of evolving Verizon from an
  analog business into a firm that can battle with the digital
  media giants and explore new technology like the Internet of
  Things and telematics.


  By acquiring Yahoo, Verizon has doubled the size of its internet
  advertising business. In the US it is poised to hold an estimated
  4.5% share of the US digital ad market, behind Facebook (17%) and
  Google (36%).


  Now the job is to work out which parts of Yahoo to keep to grow
  the business even further. Both Yahoo and AOL own content and
  advertising technology businesses, and Walden's task will be to
  select the right mix of components to ensure that the merged
  entity works efficiently.


  Tim Armstrong, AOL's CEO, said in a statement Monday that the
  transaction was about "unleashing Yahoo's full potential,
  
  building upon our collective synergies, and strengthening and
  accelerating that growth."


  With Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer announcing that she intends to stay
  at the company once the deal closes, working out how Armstrong
  and Mayer can work together — or on who will replace Mayer — will
  be one of Walden's first tasks. It comes just two years after
  Armstrong proposed a merger with Yahoo that Mayer rejected.


  So far, Walden has allowed Armstrong to run the business fairly
  independently, but it remains to be seen what will change now
  that Verizon has Yahoo in its portfolio.


  Who is Marni Walden?




Verizon



  Bloomberg published a profile of Walden earlier this month
  detailing her lifelong career in the wireless industry.


  The 49-year-old executive was named into her current position in
  February 2015. Before that she was Verizon's executive vice
  president and chief operating officer. She previously served as
  the company's vice president and chief marketing officer. Earlier
  in her career she worked at companies including AT&T Wireless
  and McCaw Cellular.


  Walden has spent her entire career in the mobile business in some
  way. In 1991, in her first job after graduating from California
  State University at Chico, she sold briefcase phones for General
  Cellular inside a home-improvement store, 
  Bloomberg reported.


  In an interview with Recode late last year, when asked about the
  speculation that Verizon might buy Yahoo, 
  Walden explained Verizon's media aspirations:


  "What I would tell you is, we didn't get into the media company
  business just to be a single-digit market share player. That's
  not why we did the deal with AOL. We have much bigger aspirations
  of how we want to grow that business. Some can happen because of
  the scale Verizon brings but we will continue to look at how we
  scale and be a meaningful player from a double-digit market
  share, and by market share I think about revenue. We definitely
  will look to build this business."


  As well as helping lead the Yahoo and AOL deals, Walden has
  overseen the launch of Verizon's mobile video streaming service
  Go90, 
  which has reportedly gotten off to a slow start. Verizon has
  not released numbers on how the service is performing, but it has
  signed up content partners including the NFL, the NBA, and Vice
  Media.


  Bloomberg described Walden's management style as efficient but
  with a "playful" style:


  "If someone shows up late to one of her meetings, she fires up a
  karaoke machine and requires the laggard to sing as punishment.
  The punctuality rule applies to everyone, including AOL's
  Armstrong, who recalls having to sing John Denver's 'Take Me
  Home, Country Roads' as penance. Walden remembers it as the
  soft-rock standard 'Feelings.'"


  Walden is on a short list of candidates to replace Lowell McAdam
  as Verizon's CEO, according to Bloomberg. Her success in handling
  the integration of Yahoo could well see Walden become Verizon's
  first female CEO.
