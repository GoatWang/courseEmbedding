														What Is Rapport?

Rapport is the key for success in sales!
Sales are down and money is tight. Sales professionals are finding themselves tripping over each other as they pursue an ever-shrinking client pool. Too often they are focused on using cheap tactics to make the sale. Sales success is not about well delivered presentations, price wars or slick closing techniques; nor does superior product knowledge alone win the day. Sales is about relationships. People purchase from individuals they know, like and trust. This is the essence of rapport.
What is rapport?
Rapport is the deepest level of relationship between two individuals in business which involves sharing common ground and is established when harmony and accord have been reached between both parties. This does not mean the individuals involved agree on every issue; it means they have attained a mutual respect for each other’s opinions.
How can I apply rapport in sales?
Rapport Mastery is the possession of skills and the genuine desire to develop relationships of mutual trust and emotional affinity. The operative words here are genuine desire. There is no place in Rapport Mastery for surface level tricks such as mimicking behaviors for the sake of manipulating unsuspecting people. Rapport Mastery works best when adopted as a life style. It is to be used as a way of dealing with people and doing business at all times, not merely to manipulate others with surface techniques or to be saved until there is a glaring problem. Rapport Mastery involves personal transparency as well as enthusiasm for the success of others. Helping a client find a solution to a problem or fulfill a need may be involved in seeing another’s success become a reality.
How quickly can I expect to attain rapport with someone?
If you browse the internet, you will find headlines such as, “Create Rapport in Seconds!” Isn’t it like the ‘microwave generation’ to expect instant results that require little or no effort and time? Look again at the definition of Rapport Mastery. Can you actually trust or have deep affinity for someone in a few seconds? Although each of us naturally ‘gels’ with a certain type of individual, there is no way to create this level of trust and regard for another person outside of the test of time. Creating rapport is a step by step process.
How do I know that I have reached this level of relationship with another individual?
Unless you have been living alone on the moon your whole life you have probably established rapport with several individuals. For instance, has anyone every asked your opinion about a movie, video game, job opportunity, or restaurant? Has anyone ever inquired of you to refer a doctor, dentist, attorney, private school or church? Individuals who have sought your advice are those with whom you have established rapport.
List their names here:
___________________________ ______________________________
___________________________ ______________________________
___________________________ ______________________________
___________________________ ______________________________
These are the individuals with whom you have created rapport. They ask for your opinion because they know, like and trust you. Once you have established rapport with a client they will purchase from you repeatedly and will provide you with quality referrals.
Take a look at the names above. Have you sold to them? Have they been added them to you prospect list? If not, I highly recommend it. These are the individuals who are primed to purchase from you. As you go through your week you will probably think of others you may add. Do so and make those sales calls soon.
Rapport is the key but it does not happen overnight. Rapport is a process that requires time, patience and a genuine interest in helping your client rather than just selling to them.
Focus on developing rapport and watch your sales increase.

A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure. I don’t want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Rapport Robert J carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Rapport Robert J



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Rapport Robert J



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Rapport Robert J



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
