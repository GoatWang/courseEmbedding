Philadelphia Radio Veteran Steve Cordasco To Host "Your Life, Your Wealth," A New Show Bringing Comfort and Clarity To The World of Personal Finance




Apr 21, 2016, 10:12am EDT














PHILADELPHIA, April 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Cordasco Financial Network (CFN) a premier financial advisory firm headquartered in Philadephia, launched a new live streaming radio program which began on March 24th that provides guidance on personal financial decisions, along with timely views and perspectives on the latest financial news from host Steve Cordasco. 
The new program, Your Life, Your Wealth, will be streamed live online at www.yourlifeyourwealth.com every Thursday from 3-4 PM EDT and will periodically include live call-in segments.

"I'm excited to help with any financial issue my listeners may face," said Steve Cordasco, founder and CEO of CFN. "It is my mission to provide an honest account of the news and trends impacting the lives and wallets of those listening in."  
The streaming program will focus on providing comfort and clarity to those who find it difficult to navigate the complexities of personal finance. The live call-in portion of the broadcast will allow callers to share their personal experiences and have a conversation with Steve Cordasco to address their issues.   
Steve Cordasco has been in the financial planning industry for nearly 30 years. With on-air contributor roles for Fox Business, CNN and as the former host of The Big Money Show on CBS Philadelphia, Steve Cordasco is an experienced broadcaster whose passion is educating individuals and audiences with a fresh alternative to mainstream financial news.
"The CFN team is thrilled to have Steve back on-air in this new on-demand format," said Josh Duvall, financial advisor at CFN. "The show is great for anyone interested in personal finance or if they're searching for sound advice from a true professional."

Cordasco Financial Network - Quarterly Review 3Q16 on Vimeo
















No results.















Quarterly Review 3Q16
9 months ago

Cordasco Financial Network:
The quarter saw a return to the ‘risk-on’ environment with markets and investors dismissing Brexit concerns and instead encouraged by continued easy global monetary policy and decent economic data. Against this backdrop, both fixed income and equity returns were robust. Watch Adam Newell, CFA, CFP® as he discusses:
•	Global economic themes
•	Equities and fixed income markets
•	Geopolitical events

About Us – The Cordasco DifferenceCordasco Financial Network was founded with the purpose of becoming something more to our clients than just another financial services firm. Our founder, Steve Cordasco, honed his skills in the financial industry for several decades, and he began to see a hole that desperately needed filling.  CFN takes the time to get to know you and what really matters to you.
You’ve worked hard all of your life. Perhaps you’re looking toward retirement or you’re looking back at a life of diligence that’s rewarded you with a hard-earned asset or sizeable nest egg. And like any prized possession, yours is precious and it must be cared for and nurtured now and for the future.
Cordasco Financial Network was created for this very purpose. Our core team is formed from highly skilled financial planners with decades of experience guiding clients through their ever changing financial life.
Like you, we are hard-working family oriented people who enjoy the holiday seasons, family vacations and watching our loved ones prosper. We worry about living a diminished retirement, what we’ll be able to pass on to our children, how well the country is being managed and what’s going to happen in the future.
Although there are financial planners out there – lots of them – it seemed to us that they were more interested in selling a package or product than watching out for the client’s best interests.
CFN understands that when it comes to your financial picture and the quality of your life, it’s more than just numbers on a balance sheet. So we take the time to get to know you and how you view the world. When we’ve established a trusting relationship with you, we can then guide you and advise you on what’s truly right for you and your family’s future.
