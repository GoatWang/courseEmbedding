	Before you invest, you
	may want to review the Fund's Prospectus, which contains more information about the Fund and its risks. For free paper or electronic copies of the Prospectus and other Fund information (including the Statement of
	Additional Information and most recent financial report to shareholders), go to www.voyainvestments.com/literature; email a request to Voyaim_literature@voya.com; call 1-800-992-0180; or ask your salesperson,
	financial intermediary, or retirement plan administrator. The Fund's Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information, each dated September 30, 2016, and the audited financial statements on pages 9-27 of the
	Fund’s shareholder report dated May 31, 2016 are incorporated into this Summary Prospectus by reference and may be obtained free of charge at the website, phone number, or e-mail address noted above.





	Investment Objective


	The Fund seeks growth of capital
	primarily through investment in a diversified portfolio of common stock of companies with smaller market capitalizations.

	Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses shown may be higher than the Fund's ratio of expenses to average net assets shown in the Financial Highlights, which reflect the operating expenses of the Fund and do not include
	Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.

	The adviser is contractually obligated to limit expenses to 1.04% through October 1, 2017. The limitation does not extend to interest, taxes, investment-related costs, leverage
	expenses, extraordinary expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. The adviser is contractually obligated to waive 0.02% of the management fee through October 1, 2017. Termination or modification of these
	obligations requires approval by the Fund’s board.







	Expense Example



	The Example is intended to help
	you compare the cost of investing in shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated. The Example shows
	costs if you sold (redeemed) your shares at the end of the period or continued to hold them. The Example also assumes that your investment had a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the
	same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

	The Example reflects applicable
	expense limitation agreements and/or waivers in effect, if any, for the one-year period and the first year of the three-, five-, and ten-year periods.


	Portfolio Turnover



	The Fund pays transaction costs,
	such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may mean higher taxes if you are
	investing in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Expense Example, affect the Fund's performance.


	During the most recent fiscal year,
	the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was 58% of the average value of its portfolio.


	Principal Investment
	Strategies


	Under normal market conditions,
	the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings for investment purposes) in common stocks of small-capitalization companies. The Fund will provide shareholders with at least 60 days' prior notice of
	any change in this investment policy.




	 

	 







	1 of 4










	For this Fund, the sub-adviser
	(“Sub-Adviser”) defines small-capitalization companies as companies that are included in the S&P SmallCap 600

	®

	Index or the Russell 2000

	®

	Index at the time of purchase, or if not included in either index, have market capitalizations that fall within the
	range of the market capitalizations of companies included in the S&P SmallCap 600

	®

	Index or the Russell 2000

	®

	Index. The market capitalization of companies within the S&P SmallCap 600

	®

	Index and the Russell 2000

	®

	Index will change with market conditions. The market capitalization range of companies in the S&P SmallCap 600

	®

	Index as of June 30, 2016 ranged from $55 million to $4.9 billion. The market capitalization range of companies in the
	Russell 2000

	®

	Index as of June 30, 2016 ranged from $1.6 million to $4.1 billion.


	The Fund may also invest in real
	estate-related securities including real estate investment trusts.


	The Fund may invest in
	derivative instruments including, but not limited to, put and call options. The Fund typically uses derivative instruments to seek to reduce exposure to other risks, such as currency risk, to substitute for taking a
	position in the underlying asset, and/or to seek to enhance returns in the Fund. The Fund may also invest, to a limited extent, in foreign stocks.


	The Fund may invest in other
	investment companies, including exchange-traded funds, to the extent permitted under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the rules, regulations, and exemptive orders thereunder (“1940
	Act”).


	In managing the Fund, the
	Sub-Adviser invests in stocks that it believes have the potential for long-term growth, as well as those that appear to be trading below their perceived value. The Sub-Adviser uses internally developed quantitative
	computer models to evaluate financial and fundamental characteristics (

	e.g.

	, changes in earnings, return on equity, and price to equity multiples) of over 2,000 companies. The Sub-Adviser analyzes these characteristics in an attempt to identify companies
	whose perceived value is not reflected in the stock price; considers the potential of each company to create or take advantage of unique product opportunities, its potential to achieve long-term sustainable growth,
	and the quality of its management.


	The Sub-Adviser may sell
	securities for a variety of reasons, such as to secure gains, limit losses, or redeploy assets into opportunities believed to be more promising, among others.


	The Fund may lend portfolio
	securities on a short-term or long-term basis, up to 33

	 1

	⁄

	3

	% of its total assets.


	Principal Risks


	You could lose money on an
	investment in the Fund. Any of the following risks, among others, could affect Fund performance or cause the Fund to lose money or to underperform market averages of other funds.


	Company:



	The price of a company’s stock could decline or underperform for many reasons including, among others, poor management, financial
	problems, reduced demand for company





	goods or services, regulatory fines and
	judgments, or business challenges. If a company declares bankruptcy or becomes insolvent, its stock could become worthless.


	Currency:



	To the extent that the Fund invests directly in foreign (non-U.S.) currencies or in securities denominated in, or that trade in, foreign
	(non-U.S.) currencies, it is subject to the risk that those foreign (non-U.S.) currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar or, in the case of hedging positions, that the U.S. dollar will decline in
	value relative to the currency being hedged by the Fund through foreign currency exchange transactions.



	Derivative Instruments:



	Derivative instruments are subject to a number of risks, including the risk of changes in the market price of the underlying securities, credit
	risk with respect to the counterparty, risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates and liquidity and volatility risk. The amounts required to purchase certain derivatives may be small relative to the
	magnitude of exposure assumed by the Fund. Therefore, the purchase of certain derivatives may have an economic leveraging effect on the Fund and exaggerate any increase or decrease in the net asset value. Derivatives
	may not perform as expected, so the Fund may not realize the intended benefits. When used for hedging purposes, the change in value of a derivative may not correlate as expected with the currency, security or other
	risk being hedged. When used as an alternative or substitute for direct cash investments, the return provided by the derivative may not provide the same return as direct cash investment. In addition, given their
	complexity, derivatives expose the Fund to the risk of improper valuation.



	Foreign Investments:

	Investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that
	invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies due to: smaller markets; differing reporting, accounting, and auditing standards; nationalization, expropriation, or confiscatory taxation; foreign currency
	fluctuations, currency blockage, or replacement; potential for default on sovereign debt; or political changes or diplomatic developments, which may include the imposition of economic sanctions or other measures by
	the United States or other governments and supranational organizations. Markets and economies throughout the world are becoming increasingly interconnected, and conditions or events in one market, country or region
	may adversely impact investments or issuers in another market, country or region.



	Growth Investing:



	Prices of growth stocks are more sensitive to investor perceptions of the issuing company’s growth potential and may fall quickly and
	significantly if investors suspect that actual growth may be less than expected. There is a risk that funds that invest in growth-oriented stocks may underperform other funds that invest more broadly. Growth stocks
	tend to be more volatile than value stocks, and may underperform the market as a whole over any given time period.



	Investment Model:

	A manager’s proprietary model may not adequately allow for existing or unforeseen market factors or









	Summary Prospectus 


	Voya Small Company Fund








	2 of 4










	the interplay between such factors. Funds that
	are actively managed, in whole or in part, according to a quantitative investment model can perform differently from the market as a whole based on the investment model and the factors used in the analysis, the weight
	placed on each factor, and changes from the factors’ historical trends. Issues in the construction and implementation of the investment models (including, for example, data problems and/or software issues) may
	create errors or limitations that might go undetected or are discovered only after the errors or limitations have negatively impacted performance. There is no guarantee that the use of these investment models will
	result in effective investment decisions for the Fund.


	Liquidity:



	If a security is illiquid, the Fund might be unable to sell the security at a time when the Fund’s manager might wish to sell, or at all.
	Further, the lack of an established secondary market may make it more difficult to value illiquid securities, exposing the Fund to the risk that the price at which it sells illiquid securities will be less than the
	price at which they were valued when held by the Fund. The prices of illiquid securities may be more volatile than more liquid investments. The risks associated with illiquid securities may be greater in times of
	financial stress. The Fund could lose money if it cannot sell a security at the time and price that would be most beneficial to the Fund.



	Market:



	Stock prices may be volatile or have reduced liquidity in response to real or perceived impacts of factors including, but not limited to,
	economic conditions, changes in market interest rates, and political events. Stock markets tend to be cyclical, with periods when stock prices generally rise and periods when stock prices generally decline. Any given
	stock market segment may remain out of favor with investors for a short or long period of time, and stocks as an asset class may underperform bonds or other asset classes during some periods. Additionally,
	legislative, regulatory or tax policies or developments in these areas may adversely impact the investment techniques available to a manager, add to costs and impair the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment
	objectives.



	Other Investment
	Companies:



	The main risk of investing in other investment companies, including exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), is the risk that the value of
	the securities underlying an investment company might decrease. Shares of investment companies that are listed on an exchange may trade at a discount or premium from their net asset value. You will pay a proportionate
	share of the expenses of those other investment companies (including management fees, administration fees, and custodial fees) in addition to the expenses of the Fund. The investment policies of the other investment
	companies may not be the same as those of the Fund; as a result, an investment in the other investment companies may be subject to additional or different risks than those to which the Fund is typically
	subject.



	Real Estate Companies and
	Real Estate Investment Trusts (“REITs”):



	Investing in real estate companies and REITs may subject the Fund to risks similar to those associated with the direct ownership of real
	estate, including losses from casualty





	or condemnation, changes in local and general
	economic conditions, supply and demand, market interest rates, zoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents, property taxes, and operating expenses in addition to terrorist attacks, war, or other acts that destroy
	real property. Investments in REITs are affected by the management skill and creditworthiness of the REIT. The Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of expenses, including management fees, paid by each
	REIT in which it invests.


	Securities Lending:



	Securities lending involves two primary risks: “investment risk” and “borrower default risk.” When lending securities,
	the Fund will receive cash or U.S. government securities as collateral. Investment risk is the risk that the Fund will lose money from the investment of the cash collateral received from the borrower. Borrower default
	risk is the risk that the Fund will lose money due to the failure of a borrower to return a borrowed security. Securities lending may result in leverage. The use of leverage may exaggerate any increase or decrease in
	the net asset value, causing the Fund to be more volatile. The use of leverage may increase expenses and increase the impact of the Fund’s other risks.



	Small-Capitalization
	Company:



	Investments in small-capitalization companies may involve greater risk than is customarily associated with larger, more established companies
	due to the greater business risks of a limited operating history, small size, limited markets and financial resources, narrow product lines, less management depth and more reliance on key personnel. The securities of
	smaller companies are subject to liquidity risk as they are often traded over-the-counter and may not be traded in volume typical on a national securities exchange.



	Value Investing:



	Securities that appear to be undervalued may never appreciate to the extent expected. Further, because the prices of value-oriented securities
	tend to correlate more closely with economic cycles than growth-oriented securities, they generally are more sensitive to changing economic conditions, such as changes in market interest rates, corporate earnings and
	industrial production. The manager may be wrong in its assessment of a company’s value and the securities the Fund holds may not reach their full values. A particular risk of the Fund’s value approach is
	that some holdings may not recover and provide the capital growth anticipated or a security judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced. The market may not favor value-oriented securities and may not
	favor equities at all. During those periods, the Fund’s relative performance may suffer. There is a risk that funds that invest in value-oriented stocks may underperform other funds that invest more
	broadly.



	An investment in the Fund is not
	a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board or any other government agency

	.

	Performance Information


	The following information is
	intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The following bar chart shows changes in the Fund's Class R6 shares’ performance from year to year, and the table compares the Fund's Class R6
	shares’ performance to the performance of a broad-based securities market index/indices for the same period. The Class R6 shares performance shown for the period prior to their inception date is the performance
	of Class I shares without adjustment for any differences in the expenses between the two classes. If adjusted for such differences, returns would be different. The Fund's performance information reflects applicable
	fee waivers and/or expense limitations in effect during the period presented. Absent such fee waivers/expense limitations, if any, performance would have been lower.

	The Fund's past performance (before and after taxes) is no guarantee of future results. For the most recent performance figures, go to www.voyainvestments.com/literature or call

Dear Valued Shareholder:                                                        

  On behalf of the Board of Directors ("Board") of Aetna Series Fund, Inc.
("Company"), we are pleased to invite you to a special meeting of the           
shareholders ("Special Meeting") of the Aetna Funds named above, each a separate
mutual fund portfolio organized within the Company, to be held at 1:00 p.m.     
Eastern time, on February 20, 2002, at 10 State House Square, Hartford,         
Connecticut 06103-3602.                                                         

  Aeltus Investment Management, Inc. ("Aeltus"), the investment adviser to
each of the Aetna Funds, was acquired in December 2000 by ING Groep N.V.        
("ING"). Headquartered in Amsterdam, ING is a global financial institution      
active in the fields of asset management, insurance and banking. ING has        
proposed a plan to integrate the operations of the Aetna Funds with the         
operations of other mutual fund groups managed by other subsidiaries of ING     
("ING fund groups"). In this regard, on December 12, 2001, the Board approved a 
series of measures that would effect the operational integration of the Aetna   
Funds with the Pilgrim Funds - a group of funds advised by ING Pilgrim          
Investments, LLC ("ING Pilgrim"), another subsidiary of ING. Specifically, the  
Board approved new investment management agreements with ING Pilgrim and        
sub-advisory agreements with Aeltus and, for the Aetna Technology Fund, Elijah  
Asset Management, LLC. The Board also approved agreements with new service      
providers for distribution, administration, custody and fund accounting as well 
as changes in other contractual arrangements to integrate the "back office" or  
operational aspects for the Aetna Funds with those of the Pilgrim Funds. In     
addition, the Board approved changes to the names of the Funds. The integrated  
Aetna and Pilgrim fund groups will be called the "ING Funds."
                                                                           [AMF]

 Integrating the fund groups will involve many changes that require your
vote, as described in the enclosed Proxy Statement. Please keep the following in
mind when considering the changes:                                              

     THE PEOPLE MANAGING YOUR FUND WILL NOT CHANGE. These proposals will
     generally not result in a change in the actual portfolio management
personnel who manage your Fund. While Aeltus will become the  
    sub-adviser rather than the adviser to the Aetna Funds (except the
         Aetna Technology Fund), Aeltus will continue to have responsibility for
      day-to-day portfolio management of the Aetna Funds. Likewise, Elijah
Asset Management, LLC will continue to have responsibility for
day-to-day portfolio management of the Aetna Technology Fund. 

       THE OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES OF YOUR FUND WILL NOT CHANGE. Integrating
       the Aetna Funds with the Pilgrim Funds will involve mostly changes in
 service providers. While the name of your Fund will change, the
    investment objectives and policies (except the Aetna International
         Fund) will remain the same. In regards to the Aetna International Fund,
         we are asking you to approve a modification to its investment objective
   to permit additional flexibility in managing the Fund's assets by
   enhancing the Fund's ability to invest in the securities of North
American, non-U.S. companies.                                 

    THE ADVISORY FEES PAID BY YOUR FUND WILL NOT INCREASE. Indeed, the
    integration may result in economies of scale for shareholders that
would reduce the expense ratios for some of the Aetna Funds.  

The Board considered the following reasons, among others, in favor of 
combining the two fund groups:                                                  

       o    The integration of the fund groups would enable the combining of
             certain back office functions such as administration, custody and
        transfer agency services that should lead to decreasing fund
            expenses per share and permit shareholders to enjoy the benefits
             of scale. This is because integrating the fund groups permits the
       Funds to spread their fixed costs over a larger asset base.
        o    ING is committed to supporting distribution efforts for the Aetna
        Funds. This offers the Funds the potential to increase their
              assets, with the long-term potential for even greater economies of
scale to be enjoyed by shareholders.                
       o    The integration would result in a larger fund group that feature
         various investment styles, strategies and asset classes. This
       would expand opportunities to exchange within the same fund
complex.                                            
      o    ING is committed to providing top-tier shareholder services for
          the integrated fund group. A fully integrated fund group would
        facilitate ING's ability to render services to shareholders.

  At the Special Meeting you will be asked to consider and approve various
proposals, including new investment advisory agreements, in order to effectuate 
the combining of fund families. These proposals are very important to the       
completion of our efforts to integrate the two fund groups. Each proposal is    
discussed in detail in the enclosed Proxy Statement, which you should read      
carefully. All of the proposals have been approved by the Board. We are asking  
you to consider them carefully and cast your vote on the enclosed Proxy Ballot  
or at the Special Meeting.                                                      

THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE
IN FAVOR OF THE PROPOSALS.

    The formal Notice of Special Meeting, a Proxy Statement and a Proxy Ballot
are enclosed. If you are a shareholder of more than one Fund, or have more than 
one account registered in your name, you will receive one Proxy Ballot for each 
account. Please vote and return each Ballot that you receive.                   

   We look forward to your attendance at the Special Meeting or to receiving
your Proxy Ballot so that your shares may be voted at the Special Meeting. If   
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call us at 1-866-515-0313.    

Sincerely,

 SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
 TO BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 20, 2002

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS NEW WITH THE AETNA FUNDS?                                               
In December 2000, ING Groep N.V. ("ING") acquired Aeltus Investment Management, 
Inc. ("Aeltus"), the investment adviser to each of the Aetna Funds.             
Headquartered in Amsterdam, ING is a global financial institution active in the 
fields of asset management, insurance and banking. ING has embarked upon a plan 
to integrate the operations of various mutual fund groups managed by some of its
subsidiaries. In this regard, on December 12, 2001, ING proposed and the Board  
of Directors ("Board") of Aetna Series Fund, Inc. ("Company") approved several  
measures to integrate the Aetna Funds with a group of mutual funds currently    
called the Pilgrim Funds, which are advised by ING Pilgrim Investments, LLC     
("ING Pilgrim"), another subsidiary of ING.                                     

Most notably, the Board approved changes in the investment advisory arrangements
for the funds which, if approved by shareholders, would result in ING Pilgrim   
becoming the investment adviser and Aeltus becoming the sub-adviser to the Aetna
Funds (except the Aetna Technology Fund, for which it is proposed that Elijah   
Asset Management, LLC ("Elijah") continue as sub-adviser). These new investment 
advisory arrangements are described later in this Proxy Statement. The Board    
also approved agreements with new service providers for distribution,           
administration, custody and fund accounting as well as changes in other         
contractual arrangements to integrate the "back office" or operational aspects  
of the Aetna Funds with those of the Pilgrim Funds. In addition, the Board      
approved changing the name of the Aetna Funds. Effective March 1, 2002, the     
integrated Aetna and Pilgrim fund groups will be called the "ING Funds." The    
result of the integration efforts will be a larger mutual fund complex.         

WHY IS THE SPECIAL MEETING BEING HELD?                                          
Integrating the fund groups will involve many changes that require your vote, as
described in this Proxy Statement. You will be asked to approve a number of new 
arrangements and agreements so that the Aetna Funds and the Pilgrim Funds will  
have consistent service providers to facilitate the integration. Please keep the
following in mind when considering the changes:                                 

     THE PEOPLE MANAGING YOUR FUND WILL NOT CHANGE. These proposals will
     generally not result in a change in the actual portfolio management
personnel who manage your Fund. While Aeltus will become the  
    sub-adviser rather than the adviser to the Funds (except the Aetna
   Technology Fund), Aeltus will continue to have responsibility for
         day-to-day portfolio management of the Aetna Funds. Elijah, the current
sub-adviser to Aetna Technology Fund, will continue to have   
      responsibility for the day-to-day management of the Aetna Technology
Fund.                                                         

       THE OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES OF YOUR FUND WILL NOT CHANGE. Integrating
        the Aetna Funds with the Pilgrim Funds will involve changes in service
    providers. While the name of your Fund will change, the investment
         objectives and policies will remain the same. An exception is the Aetna
International Fund, for which you are being asked to approve a
modification to its investment objective to permit additional 
   flexibility in managing the Fund's assets by enhancing the Fund's
 ability to invest in the securities of North American, non-U.S.
companies.                                                    

    THE ADVISORY FEES PAID BY YOUR FUND WILL NOT INCREASE. Indeed, the
         integration may result in economies of scale in some ordinary operating
     expenses that would reduce the expense ratios for some of the Aetna
Funds.                                                        

The Board considered the following reasons, among others, in favor of           
integrating the two fund groups:                                                

       o    The integration of the fund groups would enable the combining of
             certain back office functions such as administration, custody and
        transfer agency services that should lead to decreasing fund
            expenses per share and permit shareholders to enjoy the benefits
             of scale. This is because integrating the fund groups permits the
       Funds to spread their fixed costs over a larger asset base.
         o    ING is committed to supporting distribution efforts for the Funds.
              This offers the Funds the potential to increase their assets, with
              the long-term potential for even lower expense ratios from greater
economies of scale.                                 
        o    The integration would result in a larger fund group that features
         various investment styles, strategies and asset classes. This
          would expand your opportunity to exchange within the same fund
complex.                                            
      o    ING is committed to providing top-tier shareholder services for
     the integrated fund group. An integrated fund group would
        facilitate ING's ability to render services to shareholders.

P-->DEFS14A8th Page of 90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 8th
To effect the integration, the Board approved, among others, the following      
measures:                                                                       
    o    ING Pilgrim as investment adviser to each of the Aetna Funds.
      o    Aeltus as the sub-adviser to each of the Aetna Funds other than
the Aetna Technology Fund.                          
o    Elijah as the sub-adviser to the Aetna Technology Fund.  
       o    ING Pilgrim Group, LLC as the administrator to each of the Aetna
Funds.                                              
     o    ING Pilgrim Securities, Inc. as the distributor of each of the
Aetna Funds.                                        
      o    Changes in the custodian to consolidate "back office" functions
for the Aetna Funds with those of the Pilgrim Funds.

Some of these integration measures require shareholder approval; some do not.   
The Board also approved the following two measures that require shareholder     
approval but are unrelated to the integration efforts:                          

        o    Shareholders of the Aetna International Fund are asked to approve
         a change to that Fund's fundamental investment objective that
       would permit greater flexibility in investing in Canada and
Mexico, which are currently restricted.             
         o    Shareholders of all the Aetna Funds are asked to approve revisions
          to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to add flexibility,
             clarify existing provisions, and to promote consistency among the
              charters for the various registered investment companies currently
advised by Aeltus.                                  

These measures, as well as the integration measures, that require your vote are 
discussed in detail later in this Proxy Statement.

WHO IS ASKING FOR MY VOTE?                                                      
The Board is sending this Proxy Statement and the enclosed Proxy Ballot(s) to   
you and all other shareholders of the Aetna Funds. The Board is soliciting your 
proxy to vote at the Special Meeting.                                           

WHY DID YOU SEND ME THIS BOOKLET?                                               
This Proxy Statement provides you with information you should review before     
voting on the matters listed above and in the Notice of Special Meetings for    
each Fund. You are receiving these proxy materials--a booklet that includes the 
Proxy Statement and one Proxy Ballot for each Fund you own--because you have the
right to vote on important proposals concerning your investment in the Aetna    
Funds.                                                                          

WILL THE NAME OF THE AETNA FUNDS CHANGE?                                        
Yes. Both the Aetna Funds and the Pilgrim Funds will be called the "ING Funds." 
This is expected to be effective March 1, 2002. Details of the name change      
affecting your Fund will be provided to you at a later time. You will not be    
asked to vote on this.

WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE?                                                        
The Board is sending this Proxy Statement, the attached Notice of Special       
Meeting and the enclosed Proxy Ballot(s) on or about January 4, 2002 to all     
record shareholders who are eligible to vote. Shareholders who owned shares in  
any Aetna Fund at the close of business on December 12, 2001 ("record date") are
eligible to vote. Appendix 1 sets forth the number of shares of each Fund issued
and outstanding as of the record date. To the best of the Company's knowledge,  
as of December 12, 2001, no person owned beneficially more than 5% of any class 
of any Fund, except as set forth in Appendix 2. The word "you" is used in this  
proxy statement to refer to the person or entity who owns the shares, and who   
accordingly has voting rights in connection with the shares. For pension plans, 
this usually means the trustees for the plan.                                   

WHO VOTES ON EACH PROPOSAL?                                                     
All shareholders of the Company will vote as a group on Proposal 5. All         
shareholders of each Fund will vote separately on each other Proposal applicable
to their Fund.                                                                  

HOW DO I VOTE?                                                                  
In addition to solicitation by mail, certain officers and representatives of the
Company, officers and employees of Aeltus or its affiliates and certain         
financial services firms and their representatives, who will receive no extra   
compensation for their services, may solicit proxies by telephone, telegram or  
personally.                                                                     

Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc. ("Solicitor") has been engaged to     
assist in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $200,000. As the 
date of the Special Meeting approaches, certain Fund shareholders may receive a 
telephone call from a representative of the Solicitor if their votes have not   
yet been received. Authorization to permit the Solicitor to execute proxies may 
be obtained by telephonic instructions from shareholders of a Fund. Proxies that
are obtained telephonically will be recorded in accordance with certain         
procedures, as explained further in the "General Information" section of this   
Proxy Statement. The Board believes that these procedures are reasonably        
designed to ensure that both the identity of the shareholder casting the vote   
and the voting instructions of the shareholder are accurately determined.       

Shareholders may also provide their voting instructions through telephone       
touch-tone voting or Internet voting. These options require shareholders to     
input a control number which is located on each proxy card. After inputting this
number, shareholders will be prompted to provide their voting instructions on   
the Proposals. Shareholders will have an opportunity to review their voting     
instructions and make any necessary changes before submitting their voting      
instructions and terminating their telephone call or Internet link. Shareholders
who vote on the Internet, in addition to confirming their voting instructions   
prior to submission, will also receive an e-mail confirming their instructions. 

WHEN AND WHERE WILL THE SPECIAL MEETING BE HELD?                                
The Special Meeting will be held at 10 State House Square, Hartford, Connecticut
06103-3602, on February 20, 2002, at 1:00 p.m., Eastern time, and, if the       
Special Meeting is adjourned or postponed, at any adjournment or postponement of
that Meeting. If you expect to attend the Special Meeting in person, please     
notify the Company by calling 1-866-515-0313.                                   

CAN I REVOKE MY PROXY AFTER I VOTE IT?                                          
Any shareholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it by mail (addressed to 
the Secretary at the principal executive office of the Company at the address   
shown at the beginning of this Proxy Statement) or in person at the Special     
Meeting, by executing a superseding Proxy Ballot or by submitting a notice of   
revocation to the Company.                                                      

WHO PAYS FOR THIS PROXY SOLICITATION?                                           
ING or its affiliates will bear all the costs of Proposals 1 through 3 (i.e.,   
the integration measures) and part of the costs of Proposals 4 and 5. The Aetna 
Funds will only bear the costs associated with printing and mailing of the proxy
materials in connection with Proposals 4 and 5.                                 

HOW CAN I OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUNDS?                              
Copies of the Company's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended October 31,
2001, and its Semi-Annual Report for the period ended April 30, 2001, have      
previously been mailed to shareholders. This Proxy Statement should be read in  
conjunction with the Annual and Semi-Annual Reports. You can obtain copies of   
those Reports, without charge, by writing to Aeltus Investment Management, Inc.,
10 State House Square, Hartford, Connecticut, 06103-3602, Attention: Wayne      
Baltzer, or by calling 1-800-238-6263.                                          

HOW DOES THE BOARD RECOMMEND THAT I VOTE?                                       
The Board recommends that shareholders VOTE FOR each of the Proposals applicable
to their Fund(s) described in this Proxy Statement.

PROPOSAL 1
 APPROVAL OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
WHAT IS THE PROPOSAL?                                                           
  On December 12, 2001 the full Board, including the Directors who are not
interested persons of the Company, as defined in the Investment Company Act of  
1940 ("1940 Act") ("Independent Directors"), after giving due consideration to  
the benefits of integrating the fund groups, voted to approve new investment    
management agreements between each Fund and ING Pilgrim ("Proposed Management   
Agreements"), subject to the approval of shareholders, and terminate the present
management agreements between the Funds and Aeltus ("Current Agreements"). A    
form of the Proposed Management Agreements is included as Exhibit A.            

If approved by shareholders, the Proposed Management Agreements would 
remain in effect through December 31, 2002 and, unless terminated early, would  
continue from year to year thereafter, provided that each such continuance is   
approved annually with respect to each Fund (i) by the applicable Fund's Board, 
or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the        
particular Fund, and in either case, (ii) by a majority of the Fund's           
Independent Directors who are also not parties to the Proposed Management       
Agreements.                                                                     

WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE CURRENT AGREEMENTS?                                   
    The terms of the Current Agreements require Aeltus to, among other things,
select the securities to be purchased, sold or exchanged by a Fund and place    
trades for all such securities and formulate and implement continuing programs  
for the purchase and sale of securities.                                        

WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS?                       
 The terms of the Proposed Management Agreements related to the advisory
services to be provided are substantially similar in all material respects to   
the terms of each Current Agreement, except that the adviser would be ING       
Pilgrim in lieu of Aeltus as explained below. There is no change in the advisory
fees to be paid by the Funds. The Proposed Management Agreements require ING    
Pilgrim to provide, subject to the supervision of the Board, advisory and       
management services for each Fund. The Proposed Management Agreements give ING  
Pilgrim the authority to provide a continuous investment program for each Fund  
and determine the composition of the assets of each Fund's portfolio, including 
determination of the purchase, retention or sale of the securities, cash and    
other investments contained in the portfolio. They state that ING Pilgrim will  
provide investment research and conduct a program of evaluation, investment,    
sales and reinvestment of each Fund's assets. Moreover, the Proposed Management 
Agreements provide that ING Pilgrim is responsible for decisions to buy and sell
securities and other investments for each Fund's portfolio, broker-dealer       
selection (which may include brokers or dealers affiliated with ING Pilgrim),   
and negotiation of brokerage commission rates. The Proposed Management          
Agreements also state that in the event ING Pilgrim wishes to select others to  
render investment management services (i.e., sub-advisers), ING Pilgrim shall   
analyze, select and recommend for consideration such sub-advisers to the Board. 
As discussed further in Proposals 2 and 3, ING Pilgrim intends to engage Aeltus 
to serve as sub-adviser to all of the Funds other than the Aetna Technology     
Fund, and to engage Elijah to serve as sub-adviser to the Aetna Technology Fund,
and intends to delegate these advisory responsibilities described above to the  
sub-advisers.                                                                   

  The Board approved new administrative agreements with ING Pilgrim Group,
LLC ("IPG") and new underwriting agreements with ING Pilgrim Securities, Inc.   
("IPS"). IPG and IPS are each affiliates of ING Pilgrim. Their principal offices
are each located at 7337 East Doubletree Ranch Road, Scottsdale, Arizona 85258. 
The Board also approved new agreements for fund accounting and custodial        
services with State Street Bank and Trust Company (for all Funds other than the 
Aetna International Fund) as well as Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. (for the     
Aetna International Fund). Shareholders are not being asked to vote on these    
agreements.                                                                     

   In addition, the Current Agreements obligate Aeltus to limit the expenses
of certain Funds at levels that are set by the Board from time to time. The     
expense limits for the Funds that have such arrangements are shown in Appendix  
4. While the Proposed Management Agreements contain no provisions that limit    
expenses, ING Pilgrim has agreed under separate expense limitation agreements,  
which were approved by the Board at their meeting on December 12, 2001, to limit
the expenses of the applicable Funds through December 31, 2002 to the levels    
shown in Appendix 4. The "expense caps," along with all of the current and      
expected expenses of the Funds, are also described later in more detail.        

 Like each Current Agreement, the Proposed Management Agreements provide
that ING Pilgrim is not subject to liability to the Fund for any act or omission
in the course of, or connected with, rendering services under the Agreements,   
except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, negligence or reckless      
disregard of its obligations and duties under the Agreements. In addition, the  
Proposed Management Agreements provide that ING Pilgrim would not be subject to 
liability to the Fund for any act or omission in the course of, or in connection
with, a Sub-Adviser's rendering services under a Sub-Advisory Agreement, except 
by reason of ING Pilgrim's willful misfeasance, bad faith, negligence, or       
reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the Agreement.           

Each Proposed Management Agreement may be terminated by a Fund without
penalty on 60 days' written notice by the Board or by a vote of the shareholders
of a majority of the Fund's outstanding voting shares of the Fund or series, or 
on 60 days' written notice by ING Pilgrim. Each Proposed Management Agreement   
would terminate automatically in the event of its "assignment" (as defined in   
the 1940 Act).                                                                  

5 

P-->DEFS14A11th Page of 90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 11th
WHAT IS THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR EACH PROPOSED MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT?              
    Appendix 3 shows the date when each Fund commenced operations, the date of
each Current Agreement, and the dates when each Fund's Current Agreement was    
last approved by the Board and the applicable Fund's shareholders (or, in some  
cases, a Fund's sole initial shareholder). Appendix 3 also sets forth the       
anticipated effective date for each Proposed Management Agreement.              

WILL THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY FEES INCREASE?                                     
     No. The Proposed Management Agreements contain no increase in advisory fees
for any of the Funds over the amounts currently paid to Aeltus under the Current
Agreements. The annual advisory fees paid by the Funds to ING Pilgrim would be  
as follows:

WILL THERE BE EXPENSE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED ON THE FUNDS?                         
  Yes. As described above, ING Pilgrim would enter into expense limitation
agreements under separate agreements that would limit the expenses of each of   
those Aetna Funds currently subject to expense limitation arrangements. The     
expense limits under the new agreements are set forth in Appendix 4.            

  The new expense limitation agreements would become effective on the date
that ING Pilgrim becomes adviser to the Aetna Funds, subject to shareholder     
approval. Under the proposed agreements, ING Pilgrim would be responsible for   
the cost of the expense limits, and would be entitled to receive any potential  
recoupment. Specifically, ING Pilgrim would assume other expenses so that the   
total annual ordinary operating expenses of the Fund, which excludes interest,  
taxes, brokerage commissions and other investment-related costs, extraordinary  
expense such as litigation, other expenses not incurred in the ordinary course  
of the Fund's business, and expenses of any counsel or other persons or services
retained by the Directors who are not "interested persons" (as defined in the   
1940 Act) of ING Pilgrim, do not exceed the present expense limitations.        

  However, there are differences under the proposed/new expense limitation
agreements with the expense limitation arrangements currently in place for the  
Aetna Funds. For instance, extraordinary expenses and the expenses of counsel to
the Independent Directors are covered in the expenses that Aeltus may bear if   
expenses exceed prescribed limits under the current arrangements; however, these
expenses would not be covered by ING Pilgrim under the proposed arrangements.   
Moreover, the current arrangements for the Aetna Funds do not include recoupment
whereas the Proposed Management Agreements contain recoupment provisions. Under 
the recoupment provision, each Fund will, within 3 years of any waiver or       
expense assumption by ING Pilgrim, reimburse ING Pilgrim for management fees    
waived and other expenses assumed, but only if, after such reimbursement, the   
Fund's expense ratio does not exceed the applicable percentage limitation.      

WHAT IS EXPECTED TO HAPPEN TO THE EXPENSES OF THE FUNDS?                        
ING Pilgrim has advised the Board that if the measures are approved to
effect the proposed integration, it expects expense ratios (i.e., the expenses  
per share) to decrease for most of the Funds. The following chart compares the  
fees and expenses that the Aetna Funds currently pay and the fees and expenses  
it is estimated that the Funds would pay upon completion of the integration     
efforts. It is anticipated that the integration measures, specifically the use  
of common service providers, would result in greater efficiencies for management
and the realization of economies of scale in the operation of the Funds. This   
explains the anticipated reduction in total expenses for some of the Funds as   
set forth below.                                                                

     The information presented is based on the assumptions that (1) shareholders
approve all Proposed Management Agreements as well as other integration related 
proposals, and (2) vendors and other service providers provide services to the  
Funds under current fee arrangements in place for the Pilgrim Funds or under    
lower fee arrangements that ING Pilgrim has negotiated with vendors. The        
proposed expense ratios shown below were provided by ING Pilgrim and represent  
good faith estimates of expenses. Actual expense ratios can be affected by      
sales, redemptions, net asset levels, and other factors, and there can be no    
assurance that the projected expense ratios below will be realized.

WHO IS ING PILGRIM?                                                             
     ING Pilgrim is registered as an investment adviser with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The firm manages mutual funds, closed-end      
funds, variable products and private and institutional accounts. It has its     
principal offices at 7337 East Doubletree Ranch Road, Scottsdale, Arizona 85258.
As of October 31, 2001, ING Pilgrim managed over $16.6 billion in assets. As    
noted above, ING Pilgrim is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ING, the     
parent company of each Fund's current investment adviser, Aeltus. Please refer  
to Appendix 5 to this Proxy Statement for the name of ING Pilgrim's parent      
company and the names of its immediate parents. Appendix 5 also contains a list 
of the principal executive officers and directors of ING Pilgrim and identifies 
those individuals proposed as officers of the Company that are also officers    
and/or directors of ING Pilgrim.                                                

WHAT FACTORS DID THE BOARD CONSIDER?                                            
In approving the Proposed Management Agreements the Board considered a
number of factors, including, but not limited to: (1) ING Pilgrim's experience  
in overseeing sub-advisers for other mutual funds for which ING Pilgrim serves  
as investment adviser; (2) the potential benefits to the Funds and their        
shareholders that may arise from integrating the Funds with the Pilgrim Funds;  
(3) expanded exchange rights for Fund shareholders; (4) the performance of the  
mutual funds for which ING Pilgrim currently serves as investment adviser; (5)  
the depth and experience of ING Pilgrim and the financial strength of ING; (6)  
the fact that the advisory fees imposed under the Proposed Management Agreements
are identical to those imposed by Aeltus; (7) in the case of the sub-advised    
Aetna Technology Fund, the fact that the sub-adviser will remain unchanged; (8) 
the fact that Aeltus, the current investment adviser, will continue to manage   
all the Funds (except the Aetna Technology Fund) in its capacity as the proposed
sub-adviser, and accordingly the current portfolio managers of the Funds are    
generally expected to remain unchanged; (9) the projected expense ratios for    
each Fund; (10) the commonality of terms of the Proposed Management Agreements  
and Current Agreements; and (11) the fairness of the compensation payable to ING
Pilgrim under the Proposed Management Agreements in light of the services       
provided. The Board was advised by independent legal counsel with respect to    
these matters.                                                                  

Based upon its review, the Board has determined that the Proposed     
Management Agreements are in the interests of the Funds and their shareholders. 
Accordingly, after consideration of the factors described above, and such other 
factors and information it considered relevant, the Board, including the        
unanimous vote of the Independent Directors, approved the Proposed Management   
Agreements and recommended that each Fund's shareholders vote for the Proposed  
Management Agreements.                                                          

     Appendix 6 sets forth the amount of investment advisory fees that have been
paid by the Funds to Aeltus, the current investment adviser, during each Fund's 
most recent fiscal year. Please refer to Appendix 7 for a list of other         
investment companies with investment objectives similar to those of the Funds   
for which ING Pilgrim acts as investment adviser, including the rates of ING    
Pilgrim's compensation from such investment companies.                          

WHAT IS THE REQUIRED VOTE?                                                      
   Shareholders of each Fund must separately approve the applicable Proposed
Management Agreement with respect to that Fund. Approval of each Proposed       
Management Agreement requires the affirmative vote of a "majority of the        
outstanding voting securities" of the Fund, which, for this purpose, means the  
affirmative vote of the lesser of (i) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of
the Fund, or (ii) 67% or more of the shares of the Fund present at the meeting, 
if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund are represented at the   
meeting in person or by proxy.                                                  

WHAT IS THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION ON PROPOSAL 1?                               
   The Board recommends that you VOTE FOR this Proposal. Should any Proposed
Management Agreement not be approved by shareholders or if the proposed         
sub-advisory agreements in Proposals 2 and 3 are not approved by shareholders,  
Aeltus may continue to serve as the investment adviser under the applicable     
Current Agreement, or alternatively, ING Pilgrim may nonetheless serve as       
investment adviser to that Fund at the lesser of the fees that would be paid    
under the Proposed Management Agreement or ING Pilgrim's cost to render services
to the Fund, until such time as the Directors determine an appropriate course of
action.

PROPOSAL 2
APPROVAL OF SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
WHAT IS THE PROPOSAL?                                                           
   The Board has approved the engagement of Aeltus as sub-adviser to each of
the Funds other than the Aetna Technology Fund. Accordingly, on December 12,
2001, the Board of all the Aetna Funds, except the Aetna Technology Fund,       
approved new sub-advisory agreements between ING Pilgrim and Aeltus for each    
Fund ("Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreements"), provided that shareholders of the    
Funds approve the Proposed Management Agreements with ING Pilgrim (Proposal 1). 
Under the proposed arrangements, ING Pilgrim would have overall responsibility  
for the management of each Aetna Fund's portfolio. ING Pilgrim would, in turn,  
delegate portfolio management responsibilities to Aeltus as the sub-adviser for 
the Aetna Funds other than the Aetna Technology Fund. A form of the Proposed    
Sub-Advisory Agreement is included as Exhibit B.                                

If approved by shareholders, each Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement will
remain in effect through December 31, 2002 and unless terminated early, will    
continue from year to year thereafter, provided that each such continuance is   
approved annually (i) by a Fund's Board, or by the vote of a majority of the    
outstanding voting securities of a Fund, and in either case, (ii) by a majority 
of a Fund's Independent Directors who are also not parties to the Proposed      
Sub-Advisory Agreements.                                                        

WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS?                     
     Under the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreements, Aeltus would act as Sub-Adviser
to the Aetna Funds (other than the Aetna Technology Fund). In this capacity,    
Aeltus, subject to the supervision of the Board and ING Pilgrim, would provide a
continuous investment program of evaluation, investment, sales, and reinvestment
of each Fund's assets. In this regard, the advisory services to be performed by 
Aeltus under the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreements are the same as the advisory  
services provided under the Current Agreements.                                 

     Pursuant to the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreements, Aeltus is paid a specific
fee by ING Pilgrim. This fee is not paid directly by the Funds, so the          
adviser/sub-adviser arrangement would not increase the cost of advisory         
services.                                                                       

     The Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreements provide that Aeltus will not be liable
for any act or omission related to any portfolio for which Aeltus is not the    
sub-adviser nor for any act or omission related to any services provided except 
by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of 
those duties, or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties  
under the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreements. The Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreements
can be terminated by either party on 60 days' notice; by a Fund, a Fund's Board 
or by vote of the shareholders on 60 days' notice.                              

WHO IS AELTUS?                                                                  
Aeltus is a Connecticut corporation organized in 1972 and a registered
investment adviser with the SEC. As of October 31, 2001, Aeltus managed         
approximately $41 billion in assets. The firm manages mutual funds and private  
and institutional accounts. It has its principal offices at 10 State House      
Square, Hartford, Connecticut 06103-3602. Both Aeltus and ING Pilgrim are under 
the common control of ING. Prior to December 13, 2000, Aeltus was an indirect   
wholly-owned subsidiary of Aetna Inc.                                           

 Please refer to Appendix 8 to this Proxy Statement for more information
regarding Aeltus, including the name of Aeltus' parent company and the names of 
its immediate parent companies. Appendix 8 also contains a list of the principal
executive officers and directors of Aeltus and identifies those individuals     
currently serving as officers and/or Directors of the Company that are also     
officers and/or directors of Aeltus. Appendix 6 sets forth the amount of        
investment advisory fees that have been paid by the Funds to Aeltus, in its     
capacity as investment adviser, during each Fund's most recent fiscal year.     
Appendix 6 also sets forth the amount paid to any affiliated brokers during the 
recent fiscal year.                                                             

     As described further in Appendix 6, Aeltus serves as the sub-adviser to the
Pilgrim Principal Protection Fund and the Pilgrim Principal Protection Fund II  
(collective, the "PPP Funds"), the Pilgrim Research Enhanced Index Fund and the 
Pilgrim VP Research Enhanced Index Fund (collectively, the "Index Funds"),      
registered investment companies not part of the Aetna fund complex. The PPP     
Funds have investment objectives similar to the Aetna Index Plus Protection     
Fund. The Index Funds have investment objectives similar to the Aetna Index Plus
Large Cap Fund.                                                                 

WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED SUB-ADVISORY FEES?                                        
     As compensation for its services as investment adviser, each Fund would pay
ING Pilgrim a monthly advisory fee as set forth under Proposal 1. ING Pilgrim   
would pay Aeltus an annual sub-advisory fee as set forth below. The investment  
sub-advisory fee would be paid by ING Pilgrim, not the Funds.

WHAT FACTORS DID THE BOARD CONSIDER?                                            
In considering whether to recommend that the Proposed Sub-Advisory    
Agreements be approved by shareholders, the Board considered, among other       
things, that the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreements are important to the success  
of the overall plan to integrate the Funds with the Pilgrim Funds. The Board    
also considered the nature and quality of the advisory services that have been  
rendered by Aeltus to date and, in particular, the qualifications of Aeltus'    
professional staff and information related to Aeltus' past performance. In      
addition, the Board considered the importance of maintaining continuity of      
management should ING Pilgrim become the Funds' investment adviser (Proposal 1).
Moreover, the Board noted that the overall advisory fees would remain the same  
and that the advisory services to be provided by Aeltus under the Proposed      
Sub-Advisory Agreements would be materially the same as the advisory services   
provided by Aeltus under the Current Agreements. Accordingly, after             
consideration of the factors described above, and such other factors and        
information it considered relevant, the Board, on behalf of each Fund, including
the unanimous vote of the Independent Directors, approved the Proposed          
Sub-Advisory Agreements and recommended that each Fund's shareholders vote for  
the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreements.

WHAT IS THE REQUIRED VOTE?                                                      
   Shareholders of each Fund must separately approve the applicable Proposed
Sub-Advisory Agreement with respect to that Fund. Approval of each Proposed     
Sub-Advisory Agreement will require the affirmative vote of a "majority of the  
outstanding voting securities" of a Fund, which, for this purpose, means the    
affirmative vote of the lesser of (i) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of
a Fund, or (ii) 67% or more of the shares of a Fund present at the meeting, if  
more than 50% of the outstanding shares of a Fund are represented at the meeting
in person or by proxy.                                                          

WHAT IS THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION ON PROPOSAL 2?                               
The Board recommends that you VOTE FOR the approval of the Proposed   
Sub-Advisory Agreements between ING Pilgrim and Aeltus. If any Proposed         
Sub-Advisory Agreement is not approved or if the Proposed Management Agreements 
with ING Pilgrim is not approved (Proposal 1), the Directors will determine what
action, if any, should be taken. The Directors may consider proposing a         
different sub-adviser, or having no sub-adviser. In the alternative, Aeltus may 
nonetheless serve as sub-adviser to that Fund at the lesser of the fees that    
would be paid under the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreements or Aeltus' cost to     
render services to the Fund, until such time as the Directors determine an      
appropriate course of action.

PROPOSAL 3
APPROVAL OF SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT
WHAT IS THE PROPOSAL?                                                           
    Currently, Aeltus has engaged Elijah to assist it in the management of the
Aetna Technology Fund ("Technology Fund") pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement  
("Current Sub-Advisory Agreement"). ING Pilgrim has agreed to enter into a new  
agreement with Elijah ("Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement"), provided shareholders
of the Fund approve the Proposed Management Agreement between ING Pilgrim       
(Proposal 1) and the Technology Fund. Under the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement,
Elijah would provide the same services it currently provides under the Current  
Sub-Advisory Agreement. There would be no change in the sub-advisory fee.       

  On December 12, 2001, the Board of the Technology Fund, including all of
the Independent Directors, approved the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement between 
ING Pilgrim and Elijah. A copy of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement is        
included as Exhibit C.                                                          

If approved by shareholders, the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement will 
remain in effect through December 31, 2002 and unless terminated early, will    
continue from year to year thereafter, provided that each such continuance is   
approved annually (i) by the Board, on behalf of the Technology Fund, or by the 
vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, and in     
either case, (ii) by a majority of the Fund's Independent Directors who are also
not parties to the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement.                             

WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE CURRENT AGREEMENT?                                    
    The Current Agreement states, among other things, that Elijah shall, under
the supervision of the Board and Aeltus, regularly provide investment advice    
with respect to the assets held by Technology Fund and shall continuously       
supervise the investment and reinvestment of securities, instruments or other   
property (excluding cash and cash instruments) comprising the assets of         
Technology Fund.                                                                

WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT?                      
    Under the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement, Elijah would act as Sub-Adviser
to the Technology Fund. In this capacity, Elijah, subject to the supervision of 
the Directors of the Fund and ING Pilgrim, would provide a continuous investment
program of evaluation, investment, sales, and reinvestment of the Fund's assets.
The Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement is the same in many respects as the Current 
Sub-Advisory Agreement.                                                         

     The Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement provides that Elijah will not be liable
for any act or omission related to any portfolio for which Elijah is not the    
sub-adviser nor for any act or omission related to any services provided except 
by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of 
those duties, or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties  
under the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement. The Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement  
can be terminated by either party on 60 days' notice by the Fund, the Fund's    
Board or by vote of the shareholders on 60 days' notice.                        

  The Current Sub-Advisory Agreement became effective on January 19, 2000,
and was last approved by the Board on December 12, 2001 and shareholders on     
November 22, 2000 in connection with the sale of Aeltus to ING, as discussed in 
Appendix 3. During the Fund's last fiscal year, Elijah received approximately   
$57,445 from Aeltus under the Current Sub-Advisory Agreement.                   

WHO IS ELIJAH?                                                                  
Elijah, with its principal offices at 100 Pine Street, Suite 420, San
Francisco, California 94111, is a Delaware limited liability company formed in  
January 1999. Elijah manages approximately $325 million as of October 31, 2001. 
Elijah provides investment advisory services for public and private investment  
funds, institutions, offshore funds, high net worth individuals and others. The 
outstanding voting interests of Elijah are owned by its members, including      
Messrs. Elijah and Berry (Technology Fund's portfolio managers). Please refer to
Appendix 9 for information concerning Elijah's officers. Elijah is registered   
with the SEC as an investment adviser.                                          

WHAT ARE THE PROPOSED SUB-ADVISORY FEES?                                        
    As compensation for its services as investment adviser, the Fund would pay
ING Pilgrim a monthly advisory fee as set forth in Proposal 1. ING Pilgrim would
pay Elijah an annual investment sub-advisory fee of 0.50% of the Fund's average 
daily net assets, which is the same fee currently being paid. The investment    
sub-advisory fee would be paid by ING Pilgrim, not the Technology Fund.         

WHAT FACTORS DID THE BOARD CONSIDER?                                            
In considering whether to recommend that the Proposed Sub-Advisory    
Agreement be approved by shareholders, the Board considered, among other things,
the qualifications of Elijah's professional staff and information related to    
Elijah's past performance. In addition, the Board considered the importance of  
maintaining continuity of management should ING Pilgrim become the Fund's       
investment adviser (Proposal 1). Moreover, the Board noted that the sub-advisory
fees effectively would remain the same and that the Proposed Sub-Advisory       
Agreement would be materially the same as the Current Sub-Advisory Agreement    
with Elijah. Accordingly, after consideration of the factors described above,   
and such other factors and information it considered relevant, the Board,       
including the unanimous vote of the Independent Directors, approved the Proposed
Sub-Advisory Agreement and recommended that the Fund's shareholders vote for the
Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement.

WHAT IS THE REQUIRED VOTE?                                                      
Approval of the Proposed Sub-Advisory Agreement will require the      
affirmative vote of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of the    
Technology Fund, which, for this purpose, means the affirmative vote of the     
lesser of (i) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Fund, or (ii) 67%  
or more of the shares of the Fund present at the meeting, if more than 50% of   
the outstanding shares of the Fund are represented at the meeting in person or  
by proxy.                                                                       

WHAT IS THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION ON PROPOSAL 3?                               
The Board recommends that you VOTE FOR the approval of the Proposed   
Sub-Advisory Agreement between ING Pilgrim and Elijah. If the Proposed          
Sub-Advisory Agreement is not approved or if the Proposed Management Agreement  
with ING Pilgrim is not approved (Proposal 1), the Directors will determine what
action, if any, should be taken. The Directors may consider proposing a

PROPOSAL 4
APPROVAL OF MODIFICATION TO INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
WHAT IS THE PROPOSAL?                                                           
     The Board has unanimously approved, and recommends that the shareholders of
the International Fund approve a modification of the International Fund's       
investment objective. The proposal is intended to permit additional flexibility 
in managing the International Fund's assets. Because the International Fund's   
investment objective is "fundamental," shareholder approval is required to      
change it.                                                                      

International Fund's investment objective currently reads as follows: 

        "The Aetna International Fund seeks long-term capital growth primarily
through investment in a diversified portfolio of common stocks
     principally traded in countries outside of North America. The Aetna
        International Fund will not target any given level of current income."

If the Proposal is approved, International Fund's investment objective
would read as follows:                                                          

        "The Aetna International Fund seeks long-term capital growth primarily
     through investment in common stocks principally traded in countries
     outside of the United States. The Aetna International Fund will not
target any given level of current income."                    

  Approval of this Proposal will permit additional flexibility in managing
the International Fund's assets by enhancing the Fund's ability to invest in the
securities of Mexican and Canadian (i.e., North American, non-U.S.) companies.  
By making the International Fund's objective consistent with that of another    
fund managed by Aeltus which serves as an investment option for certain variable
annuity and variable life contracts, the proposed change would also permit      
Aeltus to manage both funds in a consistent manner. The proposed modification is
consistent with the Fund's investment theme of international investing.         

WHAT IS THE REQUIRED VOTE?                                                      
    The affirmative vote of the lesser of (i) 67% or more of the International
Fund's shares present at the Special Meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding
shares of the Fund are present or represented by proxy, or (ii) more than 50% of
the outstanding shares of the Fund.                                             

WHAT IS THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION ON PROPOSAL 4?                               
     The Board of Directors recommends that you VOTE FOR the modification of the
International Fund's investment objective.

PROPOSAL 5
APPROVAL OF AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION
WHAT IS THE PROPOSAL?                                                           
The Company is organized as a Maryland corporation and operates under 
Articles of Incorporation (generically referred to in this Proposal as its      
"charter") that contains various provisions primarily relating to how the       
Company conducts business and how it is governed. At the Special Meeting, you   
will be asked to approve a revised charter in the form of Articles of Amendment 
and Restatement (the "Revised Charter"). The Revised Charter amends and restates
the Company's existing charter in its entirety, while effecting a number of     
changes to the existing charter. The Board has unanimously approved the Revised 
Charter, subject to shareholder approval, and it is attached as Exhibit D to    
this Proxy Statement, marked to show changes from the Company's existing        
charter.                                                                        

WHY IS THE CHARTER BEING AMENDED AND RESTATED?                                  
  The modifications to the Company's charter are generally intended to add
flexibility, clarify existing provisions, and to promote consistency among the  
charters for the various registered investment companies currently advised by   
Aeltus. For example, numerous provisions in the Revised Charter have been       
amended to modernize their treatment of different series (or "Funds") and the   
classes thereof. In other instances, the Revised Charter merely confirms Board  
powers implicit in the existing charter. Additionally, other provisions have    
been updated to reflect, among other things, last year's acquisition of Aeltus  
by ING, and to provide the Board with the authority to adopt qualifications in  
the Company's By-Laws that would be applicable to and binding upon the current  
and future Directors (or any designated subset thereof). The latter provision   
has been added to permit the Board to formally adopt a retirement policy in the 
By-Laws, pursuant to which an Independent Director's term of office would end   
upon reaching a specified age or under other circumstances. Another amendment is
intended to address the fact that Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to
include in its charter a provision generally limiting the liability of its      
directors and officers to the corporation and the shareholders of the           
corporation for money damages. The existing charter would be further amended to 
permit the Directors, subject to applicable law, to liquidate a series or class 
without shareholder approval. Adoption of the Revised Charter will not alter in 
any way the Board's existing fiduciary obligations to act with due care and in  
the shareholders' interests. You should carefully review the Revised Charter,   
attached as Exhibit D, which is marked to show changes from the Company's       
existing charter.                                                               

WHAT HAPPENS IF SHAREHOLDERS DON'T APPROVE THE PROPOSAL?                        
If the Company's Revised Charter is not approved by shareholders, the 
Company's existing charter will remain in effect. If shareholders of the Company
approve the Revised Charter, the Revised Charter will be adopted in its entirety
with all the amendments discussed above.                                        

WHAT IS THE REQUIRED VOTE?                                                      
   Approval of the Company's Revised Charter requires the affirmative vote a
majority of the Company's outstanding shares.                                   

WHAT IS THE BOARD'S RECOMMENDATION ON PROPOSAL 5?                               
  The Board of Director's recommends that you VOTE FOR the adoption of the
Revised Charter in the form included herein as Exhibit D, with such changes or  
other additions as the Board may subsequently approve to effectuate the purposes
and interests contemplated and described herein.

 GENERAL INFORMATION
WHAT ARE THE VOTING PROCEDURES?                                                 
In all cases where a telephonic proxy is solicited, the Solicitor     
representative is required to ask for each shareholder's full name, address,    
social security or employer identification number, title (if the shareholder is 
authorized to act on behalf of an entity, such as a corporation), and the number
of shares owned, and to confirm that the shareholder has received the proxy     
materials in the mail. If the information agrees with the information provided  
to the Solicitor, then the Solicitor representative has the responsibility to   
explain the process, read the Proposals on the Proxy Ballot, and ask for the    
shareholder's instructions on the Proposals. Although the Solicitor             
representative is permitted to answer questions about the process, he or she is 
not permitted to recommend to the shareholder how to vote, other than to read   
any recommendation set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Solicitor will record  
the shareholder's instructions on the Ballot. Within 72 hours, the shareholder  
will be sent a letter or mailgram to confirm his or her vote and asking the     
shareholder to call the Solicitor immediately if his or her instructions are not
correctly reflected in the confirmation.                                        

     If a shareholder wishes to participate in the Special Meeting, but does not
wish to give a proxy by telephone or electronically, the shareholder may still  
submit the Proxy Ballot(s) originally sent with the Proxy Statement or attend in
person. Should shareholders require additional information regarding the proxy  
or replacement Proxy Ballot(s), they may contact the Solicitor toll-free at     
1-866-515-0313. As explained above, any proxy given by a shareholder is         
revocable until voted at the Special Meeting.                                   

   Shareholders may also provide their voting instructions through telephone
touch-tone or Internet voting. These options require shareholders to input a    
control number which is located on each Proxy Ballot. After inputting this      
number, shareholders will be prompted to provide their voting instructions on   
the Proposals. Shareholders will have an opportunity to review their voting     
instructions and make any necessary changes before submitting their voting      
instructions and terminating their telephone call or Internet link. Shareholders
who vote on the Internet, in addition to confirming their voting instructions   
prior to submission, will also receive an e-mail confirming their instructions. 

WHAT HAPPENS TO MY PROXY ONCE I VOTE IT?                                        
The Board has named J. Scott Fox and Wayne Baltzer as proxies. If you 
followed the instructions when you voted, your proxies will vote your shares as 
you have directed. If you submitted your proxy but did not vote on any Proposal,
your proxies will vote on that Proposal as recommended by the Board.            

WHAT IF A PROPOSAL THAT'S NOT IN THE PROXY STATEMENT COMES UP AT THE SPECIAL    
MEETING?                                                                        
If any other matter is properly presented, your proxies will vote in  
accordance with their best judgment. At the time this Proxy Statement was       
printed, the Board knew of no matter that needed to be acted on at the Special  
Meeting other than those discussed in this Proxy Statement.                     

I WANT TO ATTEND THE SPECIAL MEETING AND VOTE IN PERSON. HOW DO I DO THIS?      
   If you attend the Special Meeting and wish to vote in person, you will be
given a ballot when you arrive. However, if your shares are held in the name of 
your broker, bank or other nominee, you must bring a letter from the nominee    
indicating that you are the beneficial owner of the shares on the record date   
and authorizing you to vote.                                                    

WHAT ARE MY VOTING RIGHTS AND THE QUORUM REQUIREMENTS?                          
     As of the record date, each Fund (other than the Principal Protection Funds
and Brokerage Cash Reserves) offered five classes of shares to the public: Class
A, Class B, Class C, Class I and Class O shares. The Principal Protection Funds 
offer two classes of shares: Class A and Class B. Each class of shares has the  
same rights, privileges and preferences, except with respect to: (a) the effect 
of sales charges, if any; (b) the different distribution and/or service fees, if
any, borne by each class; (c) the expenses allocable exclusively to each class; 
(d) voting rights on matters exclusively affecting a single class; and (e) the  
exchange privilege of each class. Brokerage Cash Reserves did not offer separate
classes of shares. Appendix 1 sets forth the number of shares of each class of  
each Fund issued and outstanding as of the record date. Shareholders of each    
Fund will vote on each applicable Proposal as a single class regardless of the  
class of shares they own.                                                       

 The presence in person or by proxy of a Fund's shareholders entitled to
cast a majority in number of votes is necessary to constitute a quorum for the  
transaction of business. In the event that a quorum of shareholders is not      
represented at the Special Meeting with respect to one or more Funds, the       
Meeting may be adjourned by a majority of the applicable Fund's shareholders    
present in person or by proxy until a quorum exists. If there are insufficient  
votes to approve a Proposal, the persons named as proxies may propose one or    
more adjournments of the Special Meeting to permit additional time for the      
solicitation of proxies, in accordance with applicable law. Adjourned meetings  
must be held within a reasonable time after the date originally set for the     
meeting (but not more than 120 days after the record date). Solicitation of     
votes may continue to be made without any obligation to provide any additional  
notice of the adjournment. The persons named as proxies will vote in favor of   
such adjournment those proxies which they are entitled to vote in favor of the  
Proposal and will vote against any such adjournment those proxies to be voted   
against the Proposal.                                                           

For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting  
business at the Special Meeting, abstentions and broker "non-votes" will be     
treated as shares that are present but which have not been voted in favor of the
Proposal. Broker non-votes are proxies received by a Fund from brokers or       
nominees when the broker or nominee has neither received instructions from the  
beneficial owner or

other persons entitled to vote nor has discretionary power to vote on a         
particular matter. Accordingly, shareholders are urged to forward their voting  
instructions promptly. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of 
a "no" vote.                                                                    

The Funds expect that, before the Special Meeting, broker-dealer firms
holding shares of the Funds in "street name" for their customers will request   
voting instructions from their customers and beneficial owners. If these        
instructions are not received by the date specified in the broker-dealer firms' 
proxy solicitation materials, the Funds understand that the broker-dealers that 
are members of the New York Stock Exchange may vote on the items to be          
considered at the Special Meeting on behalf of their customers and beneficial   
owners under rules of the New York Stock Exchange.                              

    Some shares of a Fund may be held by affiliates of Aeltus, including Aetna
Life Insurance and Annuity Company ("ALIAC") in various capacities and will be  
voted in the following manner: shares of a Fund owned beneficially by Aeltus or 
an affiliate of Aeltus as an initial capital investment in a Fund or other      
direct investment of the ALIAC affiliate will be voted in favor of the          
Proposals. Shares of a Fund held of record by an ALIAC affiliate as trustee or  
custodian in connection with an employee benefit plan will only be voted in     
accordance with actual instructions received from such employee benefit plan or,
under some plans, the plan participants. With respect to shares of a Fund held  
by ALIAC in its Variable Annuity Account F as depositor under variable annuity  
contracts, this Proxy Statement is used to solicit instructions for voting      
shares of each Fund relating to such contract holders' interests in each Fund.  
ALIAC will only vote shares of each Fund held through Variable Annuity Account F
in accordance with actual instructions from such contract holders and will not  
vote shares for which no instructions are received.                             

    The number of shares that you may vote is the total of the number shown on
the Proxy Ballot accompanying this Proxy Statement. Shareholders are entitled to
one vote for each full share and a proportionate vote for each fractional share 
held.

* In December 1999, the Board approved the revision of certain Funds'         
 Investment Advisory Agreements in order to continue specific expense limitation
provisions and to make immaterial changes to clarify certain provisions and to
promote uniformity among all the Agreements. In those cases, the date of the  
agreement may be later than the dates of approval by the Board and            
shareholders.                                                                 
 ** Aetna Inc. ("Aetna"), the former indirect parent company of Aeltus, sold its
financial services and international businesses, including Aeltus, to ING. The
Aetna-ING transaction resulted in a change in ownership of Aetna's financial  
services and international businesses, which may have been deemed to cause a  
"change in control" of Aeltus, even though the services provided by Aeltus to 
 the Funds were not expected to be materially affected as a result. A "change in
control" may have caused each Fund's investment advisory agreement with Aeltus
and the sub-advisory agreement with Elijah for the Technology Fund, to which  
Aeltus is a party, to terminate. Accordingly, in order to ensure continuity of
service, shareholder approval of the current agreements was sought and        
received.                                                                     

The effective date of each Proposed Management Agreement will be March 1, 2002.

 EXHIBIT A
 FORM OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

This AGREEMENT made this ___ day of _________, 2001 between [Name of Entity]    
(the "Fund"), a [corporate form], and ING Pilgrim Investments, LLC (the         
"Manager"), a Delaware limited liability company (the "Agreement").             

WHEREAS, the Fund is an open-end management investment company registered under 
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act");                

WHEREAS, the Fund is authorized to issue shares of common stock in separate     
series with each such series representing interests in a separate portfolio of  
securities and other assets;                                                    

WHEREAS, the Fund may offer shares of additional series in the future;          

WHEREAS, the Fund desires to avail itself of the services of the Manager for the
provision of advisory and management services for the Fund; and                 

WHEREAS, the Manager is willing to render such services to the Fund;            

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, the promises and mutual       
covenants herein contained, it is agreed between the parties as follows:        

         1.    Appointment. The Fund hereby appoints the Manager, subject to the
           direction of the Board of Trustees, for the period and on the
     terms set forth in this Agreement, to provide advisory,
               management, and other services, as described herein, with respect
       to each series of the Fund (individually and collectively
       referred to herein as "Series"). The Manager accepts such
            appointment and agrees to render the services herein set forth
for the compensation herein provided.             

         In the event the Fund establishes and designates additional
              series with respect to which it desires to retain the Manager to
             render advisory services hereunder, it shall notify the Manager
               in writing. If the Manager is willing to render such services, it
         shall notify the Fund in writing, whereupon such additional
series shall become a Series hereunder.           

         2.    Services of the Manager. The Manager represents and warrants that
            it is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment
             Advisers Act of 1940 and will maintain such registration for so
        long as required by applicable law. Subject to the general
           supervision of the Board of Trustees of the Fund, the Manager
         shall provide the following advisory, management, and other
services with respect to the Series:              

               (a)   Provide general investment advice and guidance with respect
                     to the Series and provide advice and guidance to the Fund's
                    Trustees, and oversee the management of the investments of
                     the Series and the composition of each Series' portfolio of
             securities and investments, including cash, and the
                    purchase, retention and disposition thereof, in accordance
                  with each Series' investment objective or objectives and
               policies as stated in the Fund's current registration
               statement, which management may be provided by others
              selected by the Manager and approved by the Board of
                  Trustees as provided below or directly by the Manager as
  provided in Section 3 of this Agreement;

            (b)   In the event that the Manager wishes to select others to
                  render investment management services, the Manager shall
             analyze, select and recommend for consideration and
             approval by the Fund's Board of Trustees investment
                  advisory firms (however organized) to provide investment
                     advice to one or more of the Series, and, at the expense of
                  the Manager, engage (which engagement may also be by the
                   Fund) such investment advisory firms to render investment
                  advice and manage the investments of such Series and the
                  composition of each such Series' portfolio of securities
            and investments, including cash, and the purchase,
                     retention and disposition thereof, or any offering thereof,
                in accordance with the Series' investment objective or
                 objectives and policies as stated in the Fund's current
                registration statement (any such firms approved by the
              Board of Trustees and engaged by the Fund and/or the
            Manager are referred to herein as "Sub-Advisers");

              (c)   Periodically  monitor  and  evaluate  the  performance  of
                    the Sub-Advisers with respect to the investment objectives
and policies of the Series;           

               (d)   Monitor the Sub-Advisers for compliance with the investment
                    objective or objectives, policies and restrictions of each
                    Series, the 1940 Act, Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue
                     Code, and if applicable, regulations under such provisions,
and other applicable law;             

              (e)   If appropriate, analyze and recommend for consideration by
                     the Fund's Board of Trustees termination of a contract with
            a Sub-Adviser under which the Sub-Adviser provides
                    investment advisory services to one or more of the Series;

            (f)   Supervise Sub-Advisers with respect to the services that
              such Sub-Advisers provide under respective portfolio
           management agreements ("Sub-Adviser Agreements");

A-1

               (g)   Render to the Board of  Trustees of the Fund such  periodic
                  and special reports as the Board may reasonably request;
and                                   

             (h)   Make available its officers and employees to the Board of
                Trustees and officers of the Fund for consultation and
                    discussions regarding the administration and management of
                 the Series and services provided to the Fund under this
Agreement.                            

    3.    Investment  Management  Authority.  In the event the Manager
           wishes to render investment management services directly to a
        Series, then with respect to any such Series, the Manager,
              subject to the supervision of the Fund's Board of Trustees, will
               provide a continuous investment program for the Series' portfolio
        and determine the composition of the assets of the Series'
               portfolio, including determination of the purchase, retention, or
       sale, or any offering, of the securities, cash, and other
              investments contained in the portfolio. The Manager will provide
     investment research and conduct a continuous program of
            evaluation, investment, sales, and reinvestment of the Series'
             assets by determining the securities and other investments that
            shall be purchased, entered into, sold, closed, offered to the
          public, or exchanged for the Series, when these transactions
              should be executed, and what portion of the assets of the Series
               should be held in the various securities and other investments in
          which it may invest, and the Manager is hereby authorized to
               execute and perform such services on behalf of the Series. To the
            extent permitted by the investment policies of the Series, the
       Manager shall make decisions for the Series as to foreign
             currency matters and make determinations as to, and execute and
           perform, foreign currency exchange contracts on behalf of the
      Series. The Manager will provide the services under this
              Agreement in accordance with the Series' investment objective or
            objectives, policies, and restrictions as stated in the Fund's
           Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC"), as amended. Furthermore:  

        (a)   The Manager will manage the Series so that each will
                    qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter
                   M of the Internal Revenue Code. In managing the Series in
                  accordance with these requirements, the Manager shall be
                   entitled to receive and act upon advice of counsel to the
Fund or counsel to the Manager.       

            (b)   The Manager will conform with the 1940 Act and all rules
                  and regulations thereunder, all other applicable federal
             and state laws and regulations, with any applicable
                     procedures adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, and the
                    provisions of the Registration Statement of the Fund under
         the Securities Act of 1933 and the 1940 Act, as
supplemented or amended.              

            (c)   On  occasions  when the Manager  deems the  purchase  or
                     sale of a security to be in the best interest of the Series
               as well as any other investment advisory clients, the
                     Manager may, to the extent permitted by applicable laws and
                  regulations and any applicable procedures adopted by the
                  Fund's Board of Trustees, but shall not be obligated to,
                  aggregate the securities to be so sold or purchased with
                  those of its other clients where such aggregation is not
         inconsistent with the policies set forth in the
                  Registration Statement. In such event, allocation of the
                  securities so purchased or sold, as well as the expenses
                     incurred in the transaction, will be made by the Manager in
                    a manner that is fair and equitable in the judgment of the
                     Manager in the exercise of its fiduciary obligations to the
Fund and to such other clients.       

             (d)   In connection with the purchase and sale of securities of
                   the Series, the Manager will arrange for the transmission
                 to the custodian for the Fund on a daily basis, of such
              confirmation, trade tickets, and other documents and
                   information, including, but not limited to, Cusip, Cedel,
                   or other numbers that identify securities to be purchased
               or sold on behalf of the Series, as may be reasonably
          necessary to enable the custodian to perform its
                administrative and recordkeeping responsibilities with
                     respect to the Series. With respect to portfolio securities
              to be purchased or sold through the Depository Trust
          Company, the Manager will arrange for the prompt
                transmission of the confirmation of such trades to the
Fund's custodian.                     

      (e)   The Manager will assist the custodian or portfolio
                  accounting agent for the Fund in determining, consistent
                     with the procedures and policies stated in the Registration
              Statement for the Fund and any applicable procedures
                   adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees, the value of any
                portfolio securities or other assets of the Series for
                 which the custodian or portfolio accounting agent seeks
assistance or review from the Manager.

              (f)   The Manager will make available to the Fund, promptly upon
                 request, any of the Series' or the Manager's investment
                    records and ledgers as are necessary to assist the Fund in
                     complying with the requirements of the 1940 Act, as well as
            other applicable laws. The Manager will furnish to
                   regulatory authorities having the requisite authority any
                information or reports in connection with its services
                  which may be requested in order to ascertain whether the
                operations of the Fund are being conducted in a manner
          consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

            (g)   The Manager will regularly report to the Fund's Board of
                   Trustees on the investment program for the Series and the
           issuers and securities represented in the Series'
                  portfolio, and will furnish the Fund's Board of Trustees
              with respect to the Series such periodic and special
         reports as the Trustees may reasonably request.

        (h)   In connection with its  responsibilities  under this
                    Section 3, the Manager is responsible for decisions to buy
                   and sell securities and other investments for the Series'
                portfolio, broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of
brokerage                             

A-2

                  commission rates. The Manager's primary consideration in
                     effecting a security transaction will be to obtain the best
                   execution for the Series, taking into account the factors
                    specified in the Prospectus and/or Statement of Additional
                  Information for the Fund, which include price (including
                    the applicable brokerage commission or dollar spread), the
             size of the order, the nature of the market for the
                  security, the timing of the transaction, the reputation,
                 experience and financial stability of the broker-dealer
                 involved, the quality of the service, the difficulty of
           execution, execution capabilities and operational
                  facilities of the firms involved, and the firm's risk in
                   positioning a block of securities. Accordingly, the price
                     to the Series in any transaction may be less favorable than
                     that available from another broker-dealer if the difference
                    is reasonably justified, in the judgment of the Manager in
                   the exercise of its fiduciary obligations to the Fund, by
                    other aspects of the portfolio execution services offered.
               Subject to such policies as the Board of Trustees may
            determine and consistent with Section 28(e) of the
                  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Manager
                 shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have
                  breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise
                   solely by reason of its having caused the Series to pay a
            broker-dealer for effecting a portfolio investment
                   transaction in excess of the amount of commission another
             broker-dealer would have charged for effecting that
                   transaction, if the Manager determines in good faith that
                     such amount of commission was reasonable in relation to the
                  value of the brokerage and research services provided by
            such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either that
         particular transaction or the Manager's overall
                responsibilities with respect to the Series and to its
           other clients as to which it exercises investment
                   discretion. To the extent consistent with these standards
                and in accordance with Section 11(a) of the Securities
                 Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 11a2-2(T) thereunder, the
                     Manager is further authorized to allocate the orders placed
               by it on behalf of the Series to the Manager if it is
           registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, to an
                  affiliated broker-dealer, or to such brokers and dealers
                    who also provide research or statistical material or other
                    services to the Series, the Manager or an affiliate of the
               Manager. Such allocation shall be in such amounts and
                    proportions as the Manager shall determine consistent with
                  the above standards, and the Manager will report on said
                   allocation regularly to the Board of Trustees of the Fund
                 indicating the broker-dealers to which such allocations
have been made and the basis therefor.

       4.    Conformity with Applicable Law. The Manager, in the performance
              of its duties and obligations under this Agreement, shall act in
             conformity with the Registration Statement of the Fund and with
             the instructions and directions of the Board of Trustees of the
            Fund and will conform to, and comply with, the requirements of
              the 1940 Act and all other applicable federal and state laws and
regulations.                                      

       5.    Exclusivity. The services of the Manager to the Fund under this
               Agreement are not to be deemed exclusive, and the Manager, or any
            affiliate thereof, shall be free to render similar services to
          other investment companies and other clients (whether or not
              their investment objectives and policies are similar to those of
              any of the Series) and to engage in other activities, so long as
its services hereunder are not impaired thereby.  

    6.    Records. The Fund agrees to maintain and to preserve for the
           periods prescribed under the 1940 Act any such records as are
              required to be maintained by the Fund with respect to the Series
             by the 1940 Act. The Manager further agrees that all records of
             the Series are the property of the Fund and, to the extent held
            by the Manager, it will promptly surrender any of such records
upon request.                                     

        7.    Expenses.  During the term of this  Agreement,  the Manager will
               pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities
              under this Agreement, except such expenses as are assumed by the
             Fund under this Agreement and such expenses as are assumed by a
              Sub-Adviser under its Sub-Adviser Agreement. The Manager further
           agrees to pay all fees payable to the Sub-Advisers, executive
       salaries and expenses of the Trustees of the Fund who are
            employees of the Manager or its affiliates, and office rent of
          the Fund. The Fund shall be responsible for all of the other
            expenses of its operations, including, without limitation, the

      8.    Compensation. For the services provided by the Manager to each
         Series pursuant to this Agreement, the Fund will pay to the
          Manager an annual fee equal to the amount specified for such
              Series in Schedule A hereto, payable monthly in arrears. Payment
              of the above fees shall be in addition to any amount paid to the
             Manager for the salary of its employees for performing services
               which are an obligation of the Fund as provided in Section 7. The
             fee will be appropriately pro-rated to reflect any portion of a
             calendar month that this Agreement is not in effect between us.

9.    Liability  of the  Manager.  The  Manager  may rely on  
      information reasonably believed by it to be accurate and
              reliable. Except as may otherwise be required by the 1940 Act or
             the rules thereunder, neither the Manager nor its stockholders,
              officers, trustees, employees, or agents shall be subject to any
            liability for, or any damages, expenses, or losses incurred in
            connection with, any act or omission connected with or arising
          out of any services rendered under this Agreement, except by
            reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or negligence in the
           performance of the Manager's duties, or by reason of reckless
          disregard of the Manager's obligations and duties under this
               Agreement. Except as may otherwise be required by the 1940 Act or
             the rules thereunder, neither the Manager nor its stockholders,
              officers, trustees, employees, or agents shall be subject to any
            liability for, or any damages, expenses, or losses incurred in
             connection with, any act or omission by a Sub-Adviser or any of
             the Sub-Adviser's stockholders or partners, officers, trustees,
       employees, or agents connected with or arising out of any
               services rendered under a Sub-Adviser Agreement, except by reason
     of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or negligence in the
             performance of the Manager's duties under this Agreement, or by
           reason of reckless disregard of the Manager's obligations and
              duties under this Agreement. The debts, liabilities, obligations
              and expenses incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with
             respect to a Series shall be enforceable against the assets and
         property of that Series only, and not against the assets or
property of any other series of the Fund.         

     10.   Continuation  and  Termination.  This Agreement  shall become
       effective on the date first written above, subject to the
               condition that the Fund's Board of Trustees, including a majority
               of those Trustees who are not interested persons (as such term is
              defined in the 1940 Act) of the Manager, and the shareholders of
     each Series, shall have approved this Agreement. Unless
            terminated as provided herein, the Agreement shall continue in
       full force and effect through December 31, 2002 and shall
               continue from year to year thereafter with respect to each Series
           so long as such continuance is specifically approved at least
             annually (i) by the vote of a majority of the Board of Trustees
           of the Fund, or (ii) by vote of a majority of the outstanding
           voting shares of the Series (as defined in the 1940 Act), and
             provided continuance is also approved by the vote of a majority
              of the Board of Trustees of the Fund who are not parties to this
               Agreement or "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of
             the Fund or the Manager, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose of voting on such approval.           

         However, any approval of this Agreement by the holders of a
             majority of the outstanding shares (as defined in the 1940 Act)
        of a Series shall be effective to approve or continue this
            Agreement with respect to such Series notwithstanding (i) that
               this Agreement has not been approved by the holders of a majority
             of the outstanding shares of any other Series or (ii) that this
              Agreement has not been approved by the vote of a majority of the
           outstanding shares of the Fund, unless such approval shall be
               required by any other applicable law or otherwise. This Agreement
           may be terminated by the Fund at any time, in its entirety or
              with respect to a Series, without the payment of any penalty, by
             vote of a majority of the Board of Trustees of the Fund or by a
              vote of a majority of the outstanding voting shares of the Fund,
       or with respect to a Series, by vote of a majority of the
           outstanding voting shares of such Series, on sixty (60) days'
           written notice to the Manager, or by the Manager at any time,
             without the payment of any penalty, on sixty (60) days' written
       notice to the Fund. This Agreement will automatically and
       immediately terminate in the event of its "assignment" as
described in the 1940 Act.                        

  11.   Amendments. No provision of this Agreement may be changed,
     waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by an
     instrument in writing signed by the party against which
            enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or termination is
               sought. If shareholder approval of an amendment is required under
          the 1940 Act, no such amendment shall become effective until
             approved by a vote of the majority of the outstanding shares of
           the Fund. Otherwise, a written amendment of this Agreement is
          effective upon the approval of the Board of Trustees and the
Manager.                                          

      12.   Use of Names. It is understood that the names "ING," "Pilgrim"
           and "ING Pilgrim Investments, LLC" or any derivatives thereof
               (including the name "ING Pilgrim") or logos associated with those
               names is the valuable property of the Manager and its affiliates,
            and that the Fund and/or the Series have the right to use such
            names (or derivatives or logos) only so long as this Agreement
          shall continue with respect to such Fund and/or Series. Upon
       termination of this Agreement, the Fund (or Series) shall
              forthwith cease to use such names (or derivatives or logos) and,
           in the case of the Fund, shall promptly amend its Articles of
          Incorporation to change its name (if such names are included
therein).                                         

      13.   Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be executed in one or more
            counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original.

             (a)   This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State
                     of Arizona, provided that nothing herein shall be construed
                    in a manner inconsistent with the 1940 Act, the Investment
                Advisers Act of 1940, or any rules or order of the SEC
thereunder.

               the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected
             thereby and, to this extent, the provisions of this
    Agreement shall be deemed to be severable.

               (c)   The captions of this Agreement are included for convenience
                  only and in no way define or limit any of the provisions
                  hereof or otherwise affect their construction or effect.

  15.    Limitation of Liability for Claims. The Manager is hereby
             expressly put on notice of the limitation of liability as set
                forth in the Declaration and agrees that the obligations assumed
               by the Trust on behalf of the Series pursuant to this Agreement

               assets, and the Manager shall not seek satisfaction of any such
          obligation from the shareholders or any shareholder of the
             Series or any other Series of the Trust, or from any trustee,
                officer, employee or agent of the Trust. The Manager understands
        that the rights and obligations of each Series under the
               Declaration are separate and distinct from those of any and all
  other Series. [Massachusetts business trusts only]

 EXHIBIT B
FORM OF SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT

AGREEMENT made this ____ day of ________, 2001 between ING Pilgrim Investments, 
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Manager"), and Aeltus Investment
Management, Inc. a [corporate form] (the "Sub-Adviser").                        

WHEREAS, [Name of Registrant] (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment   
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as an open-end, management    
investment company;                                                             

WHEREAS, the Fund is authorized to issue separate series, each series having its
own investment objective or objectives, policies, and limitations;              

WHEREAS, the Fund may offer shares of additional series in the future;          

WHEREAS, pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement, dated the date hereof  
(the "Management Agreement"), a copy of which has been provided to the          
Sub-Adviser, the Fund has retained the Manager to render advisory and management
services with respect to certain of the Fund's series; and                      

WHEREAS, pursuant to authority granted to the Manager in the Management         
Agreement, the Manager wishes to retain the Sub-Adviser to furnish investment   
advisory services to one or more of the series of the Fund, and the Sub-Adviser 
is willing to furnish such services to the Fund and the Manager;                

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the promises and mutual    
covenants herein contained, it is agreed between the Manager and the Sub-Adviser
as follows:                                                                     

         1.   Appointment. The Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser to act as
            the investment adviser and manager to the series of the Fund set
            forth on Schedule A hereto (the "Series") for the periods and on
          the terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts
          such appointment and agrees to furnish the services herein set
forth for the compensation herein provided.         

           In the event the Fund designates one or more series (other than
              the Series) with respect to which the Manager wishes to retain the
            Sub-Adviser to render investment advisory services hereunder, it
          shall notify the Sub-Adviser in writing. If the Sub-Adviser is
           willing to render such services, it shall notify the Manager in
           writing, whereupon such series shall become a Series hereunder,
and be subject to this Agreement.                   

    2.   Sub-Adviser Duties.  Subject to the supervision of the Fund's
             Board of Trustees and the Manager, the Sub-Adviser will provide a
        continuous investment program for each Series' portfolio and
             determine in its discretion the composition of the assets of each
       Series' portfolio, including determination of the purchase,
             retention, or sale of the securities, cash, and other investments
    contained in the portfolio. The Sub-Adviser will provide
   investment research and conduct a continuous program of
           evaluation, investment, sales, and reinvestment of each Series'
           assets by determining the securities and other investments that
            shall be purchased, entered into, sold, closed, or exchanged for
            the Series, when these transactions should be executed, and what
             portion of the assets of the Series should be held in the various
           securities and other investments in which it may invest. To the
           extent permitted by the investment policies of each Series, the
         Sub-Adviser shall make decisions for the Series as to foreign
          currency matters and make determinations as to and execute and
        perform foreign currency exchange contracts on behalf of the
        Series. The Sub-Adviser will provide the services under this
             Agreement in accordance with each Series' investment objective or
          objectives, policies, and restrictions as stated in the Fund's
         Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
            Commission ("SEC"), as amended, copies of which shall be sent to
            the Sub-Adviser by the Manager prior to the commencement of this
    Agreement and promptly following any such amendment. The
Sub-Adviser further agrees as follows:              

            (a) The Sub-Adviser will conform with the 1940 Act and all rules
                and regulations thereunder, all other applicable federal and
              state laws and regulations, with any applicable procedures
        adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees of which the
               Sub-Adviser has been sent a copy, and the provisions of the
                 Registration Statement of the Fund filed under the Securities
                  Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and the 1940 Act, as supplemented
                 or amended, of which the Sub-Adviser has received a copy, and
               with the Manager's portfolio manager operating policies and
                procedures as in effect on the date hereof, as such policies
               and procedures may be revised or amended by the Manager and
                  agreed to by the Sub-Adviser. In carrying out its duties under
               the Sub-Adviser Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will comply with
the following policies and procedures:      

                  (i)   The Sub-Adviser will manage each Series so that it meets
                    the income and asset diversification requirements of
         Section 851 of the Internal Revenue Code.

               (ii)  The Sub-Adviser will vote all proxies solicited by or
                      with respect to the issuers of securities which assets
              of the Series are invested consistent with any
                        procedures or guidelines promulgated by the Board or the
             Manager, or if none, in the discretion of the
                        Sub-Adviser based upon the best interests of the Series.
                 The Sub-Adviser will maintain appropriate records
                     detailing its voting of proxies on behalf of the Fund
and will provide to the Fund at 

B-1 

P-->DEFS14A62nd Page of 90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 62nd
                    least quarterly a report setting forth the proposals
                        voted on and how the Series' shares were voted since the
                     prior report, including the name of the corresponding
issuers.                        

                (iii) In connection with the purchase and sale of securities
                     for each Series, the Sub-Adviser will arrange for the
                      transmission to the custodian and portfolio accounting
           agent for the Series on a daily basis, such
                    confirmation, trade tickets, and other documents and
                  information, including, but not limited to, Cusip,
                      Cedel, or other numbers that identify securities to be
                    purchased or sold on behalf of the Series, as may be
                reasonably necessary to enable the custodian and
                        portfolio accounting agent to perform its administrative
                      and recordkeeping responsibilities with respect to the
                  Series. With respect to portfolio securities to be
                 settled through the Depository Trust Company, the
                       Sub-Adviser will arrange for the prompt transmission of
                       the confirmation of such trades to the Fund's custodian
and portfolio accounting agent. 

                 (iv)  The Sub-Adviser will assist the custodian and portfolio
               accounting agent for the Fund in determining or
                       confirming, consistent with the procedures and policies
                    stated in the Registration Statement for the Fund or
                  adopted by the Board of Trustees, the value of any
                      portfolio securities or other assets of the Series for
                        which the custodian and portfolio accounting agent seeks
               assistance from or identifies for review by the
             Sub-Adviser. The parties acknowledge that the
                        Sub-Adviser is not a custodian of the Series' assets and
                   will not take possession or custody of such assets.

                 (v)   The Sub-Adviser will provide the Manager, no later than
                   the 20th day following the end of each of the first
                     three fiscal quarters of each Series and the 45th day
                       following the end of each Series' fiscal year, a letter
                       to shareholders (to be subject to review and editing by
                     the Manager) containing a discussion of those factors
                 referred to in Item 5(a) of 1940 Act Form N-1A in
                        respect of both the prior quarter and the fiscal year to
date.                           

                  (vi)  The Sub-Adviser will complete and deliver to the Manager
                        a written compliance checklist in a form provided by the
                       Manager for each month by the 10th day of the following
month.                          

                 (vii) The parties agree that in the event that the Manager or
               an affiliated person of the Manager sends sales
               literature or other promotional material to the
                        Sub-Adviser for its approval and the Sub-Adviser has not
                        commented within 10 days, the Manager and its affiliated
                       persons may use and distribute such sales literature or
other promotional material.     

       (b) The Sub-Adviser will make available to the Fund and the
                 Manager, promptly upon request, any of the Series' investment
                  records and ledgers maintained by the Sub-Adviser (which shall
         not include the records and ledgers maintained by the
                custodian or portfolio accounting agent for the Fund) as are
               necessary to assist the Fund and the Manager to comply with
                requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act
             of 1940 (the "Advisers Act"), as well as other applicable
                laws. The Sub-Adviser will furnish to regulatory authorities
                having the requisite authority any information or reports in
                connection with such services in respect to the Series which
                 may be requested in order to ascertain whether the operations
               of the Fund are being conducted in a manner consistent with
applicable laws and regulations.            

           (c) The Sub-Adviser will provide reports to the Fund's Board of
              Trustees for consideration at meetings of the Board on the
          investment program for each Series and the issuers and
              securities represented in each Series' portfolio, and will
             furnish the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to each
                Series such periodic and special reports as the Trustees and
the Manager may reasonably request.         

      3.   Broker-Dealer  Selection.  The  Sub-Adviser  is  authorized  to
           make decisions to buy and sell securities and other investments
    for each Series' portfolio, broker-dealer selection, and
             negotiation of brokerage commission rates in effecting a security
             transaction. The Sub-Adviser's primary consideration in effecting
           a security transaction will be to obtain the best execution for
        the Series, taking into account the factors specified in the
         prospectus and/or statement of additional information for the
        Fund, and determined in consultation with the Manager, which
           include price (including the applicable brokerage commission or
           dollar spread), the size of the order, the nature of the market
            for the security, the timing of the transaction, the reputation,
       the experience and financial stability of the broker-dealer
              involved, the quality of the service, the difficulty of execution,
            and the execution capabilities and operational facilities of the
        firm involved, and the firm's risk in positioning a block of
             securities. Accordingly, the price to a Series in any transaction
  may be less favorable than that available from another
           broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably justified, in the
        judgment of the Sub-Adviser in the exercise of its fiduciary
      obligations to the Fund, by other aspects of the portfolio
              execution services offered. Subject to such policies as the Fund's
          Board of Trustees or Manager may determine and consistent with
     Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
          Sub-Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully or to
         have breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise
   solely by reason of its having caused a Series to pay a
             broker-dealer for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in
          excess of the amount of commission another broker-dealer would
           have charged for effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser
       determines in good faith that such amount of commission was
             reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research
              services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either
             that particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser's or the Manager's
            overall responsibilities with respect to the Series and to their
respective other clients as to which they exercise  

B-2 

P-->DEFS14A63rd Page of 90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 63rd
        investment discretion. The Sub-Adviser will consult with the
         Manager to the end that portfolio transactions on behalf of a
          Series are directed to broker-dealers on the basis of criteria
           reasonably considered appropriate by the Manager. To the extent
       consistent with these standards, the Sub-Adviser is further
         authorized to allocate the orders placed by it on behalf of a
            Series to the Sub-Adviser if it is registered as a broker-dealer
            with the SEC, to an affiliated broker-dealer, or to such brokers
             and dealers who also provide research or statistical material, or
             other services to the Series, the Sub-Adviser, or an affiliate of
         the Sub-Adviser. Such allocation shall be in such amounts and
              proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall determine consistent with the
    above standards, and the Sub-Adviser will report on said
           allocation regularly to the Fund's Board of Trustees indicating
           the broker-dealers to which such allocations have been made and
the basis therefor.                                 

       4.   Disclosure  about  Sub-Adviser.  The  Sub-Adviser  has  reviewed
        the most recent Post-Effective Amendment to the Registration
              Statement for the Fund filed with the SEC that contains disclosure
         about the Sub-Adviser, and represents and warrants that, with
          respect to the disclosure about the Sub-Adviser or information
      relating, directly or indirectly, to the Sub-Adviser, such
             Registration Statement contains, as of the date hereof, no untrue
             statement of any material fact and does not omit any statement of
      a material fact which was required to be stated therein or
           necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light of
             the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
         Sub-Adviser further represents and warrants that it is a duly
         registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act and will
           maintain such registration so long as this Agreement remains in
           effect. The Sub-Adviser will provide the Manager with a copy of
           the Sub-Adviser's Form ADV, Part II at the time the Form ADV is
filed with the SEC.                                 

     5.   Expenses.  During the term of this Agreement,  the Sub-Adviser
            will pay all expenses incurred by it and its staff and for their
         activities in connection with its portfolio management duties
              under this Agreement. The Manager or the Fund shall be responsible
for all the expenses of the Fund's operations.      

     6.   Compensation.  For the services  provided to each Series,  the
              Manager will pay the Sub-Adviser an annual fee equal to the amount
              specified for such Series in Schedule A hereto, payable monthly in
          arrears. The fee will be appropriately prorated to reflect any
            portion of a calendar month that this Agreement is not in effect
       among the parties. In accordance with the provisions of the
           Management Agreement, the Manager is solely responsible for the
             payment of fees to the Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser agrees to
       seek payment of its fees solely from the Manager; provided,
       however, that if the Fund fails to pay the Manager all or a
              portion of the management fee under said Management Agreement when
          due, and the amount that was paid is insufficient to cover the
              Sub-Adviser's fee under this Agreement for the period in question,
           then the Sub-Adviser may enforce against the Fund any rights it
      may have as a third-party beneficiary under the Management
           Agreement and the Manager will take all steps appropriate under
      the circumstances to collect the amount due from the Fund.

7.   Compliance.                                              

              (a) The Sub-Adviser agrees to use reasonable compliance techniques
                as the Manager or the Board of Trustees may adopt, including
any written compliance procedures.          

        (b) The Sub-Adviser agrees that it shall promptly notify the
          Manager and the Fund (1) in the event that the SEC has
         censured the Sub-Adviser; placed limitations upon its
                 activities, functions or operations; suspended or revoked its
           registration as an investment adviser; or has commenced
             proceedings or an investigation that may result in any of
            these actions, or (2) upon having a reasonable basis for
                believing that the Series has ceased to qualify or might not
                qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M
                of the Internal Revenue Code. The Sub-Adviser further agrees
               to notify the Manager and the Fund promptly of any material
               fact known to the Sub-Adviser respecting or relating to the
         Sub-Adviser that is not contained in the Registration
             Statement or prospectus for the Fund (which describes the
              Series), or any amendment or supplement thereto, or if any
          statement contained therein that becomes untrue in any
material respect.                           

    (c) The Manager agrees that it shall promptly notify the
              Sub-Adviser (1) in the event that the SEC has censured the
                Manager or the Fund; placed limitations upon either of their
                  activities, functions, or operations; suspended or revoked the
           Manager's registration as an investment adviser; or has
                commenced proceedings or an investigation that may result in
               any of these actions, or (2) upon having a reasonable basis
                for believing that the Series has ceased to qualify or might
                  not qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter
M of the Internal Revenue Code.             

        8.   Books and Records. The Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that all records
              which it maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund and
        further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any of such
          records upon the Fund's or the Manager's request in compliance
            with the requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, although
              the Sub-Adviser may, at its own expense, make and retain a copy of
            such records. The Sub-Adviser further agrees to preserve for the
           periods prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records
       required to be maintained by Rule 31a-l under the 1940 Act.

    9.   Cooperation;  Confidentiality.  Each party to this  Agreement
             agrees to cooperate with the other party and with all appropriate
      governmental authorities having the requisite jurisdiction
           (including, but not limited to, the SEC) in connection with any
            investigation or inquiry relating to this Agreement or the Fund.
    Subject to the foregoing, the Sub-Adviser shall treat as

B-3 

P-->DEFS14A64th Page of 90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 64th
              confidential all information pertaining to the Fund and actions of
            the Fund, the Manager and the Sub-Adviser, and the Manager shall
            treat as confidential and use only in connection with the Series
       all information furnished to the Fund or the Manager by the
          Sub-Adviser, in connection with its duties under the agreement
        except that the aforesaid information need not be treated as
             confidential if required to be disclosed under applicable law, if
         generally available to the public through means other than by
              disclosure by the Sub-Adviser or the Manager, or if available from
      a source other than the Manager, Sub-Adviser or this Fund.

      10.  Representations Respecting Sub-Adviser. The Manager agrees that
             neither the Manager, nor affiliated persons of the Manager, shall
             give any information or make any representations or statements in
           connection with the sale of shares of the Series concerning the
   Sub-Adviser or the Series other than the information or
    representations contained in the Registration Statement,
             prospectus, or statement of additional information for the Fund's
             shares, as they may be amended or supplemented from time to time,
       or in reports or proxy statements for the Fund, or in sales
           literature or other promotional material approved in advance by
    the Sub-Adviser, except with the prior permission of the
Sub-Adviser.                                        

        11.  Control. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, it
            is understood and agreed that the Fund shall at all times retain
        the ultimate responsibility for and control of all functions
              performed pursuant to this Agreement and has reserved the right to
             reasonably direct any action hereunder taken on its behalf by the
Sub-Adviser.                                        

        12.  Liability. Except as may otherwise be required by the 1940 Act or
            the rules thereunder or other applicable law, the Manager agrees
           that the Sub-Adviser, any affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser,
             and each person, if any, who, within the meaning of Section 15 of
   the 1933 Act controls the Sub-Adviser (1) shall bear no
            responsibility and shall not be subject to any liability for any
           act or omission respecting any series of the Fund that is not a
            Series hereunder, and (2) shall not be liable for, or subject to
           any damages, expenses, or losses in connection with, any act or
           omission connected with or arising out of any services rendered
              under this Agreement, except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
        faith, or negligence in the performance of the Sub-Adviser's
           duties, or by reason of reckless disregard of the Sub-Adviser's
obligations and duties under this Agreement.        

13.  Indemnification.                                         

     (a) The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
              Sub-Adviser, any affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser, and
                 each person, if any, who, within the meaning of Section 15 of
                the 1933 Act controls ("controlling person") the Sub-Adviser
          (all of such persons being referred to as "Sub-Adviser
             Indemnified Persons") against any and all losses, claims,
                  damages, liabilities, or litigation (including legal and other
                  expenses) to which a Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person may become
               subject under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act,
                under any other statute, at common law or otherwise, arising
               out of the Manager's responsibilities to the Fund which (1)
       may be based upon the Manager's negligence, willful
              misfeasance, or bad faith in the performance of its duties
          (which could include a negligent action or a negligent
            omission to act), or by reason of the Manager's reckless
                 disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement,
            or (2) may be based upon any untrue statement or alleged
        untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
               Registration Statement or prospectus covering shares of the
                  Fund or any Series, or any amendment thereof or any supplement
                 thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein
                 a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
           make the statements therein not misleading, unless such
               statement or omission was made in reliance upon information
             furnished to the Manager or the Fund or to any affiliated
              person of the Manager by a Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person;
                  provided however, that in no case shall the indemnity in favor
              of the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person be deemed to protect
              such person against any liability to which any such person
                would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance,
            bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its
                 duties, or by reason of its reckless disregard of obligations
and duties under this Agreement.            

             (b) Notwithstanding Section 12 of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser
          agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Manager, any
                affiliated person of the Manager, and any controlling person
            of the Manager (all of such persons being referred to as
              "Manager Indemnified Persons") against any and all losses,
                claims, damages, liabilities, or litigation (including legal
                 and other expenses) to which a Manager Indemnified Person may
                  become subject under the 1933 Act, 1940 Act, the Advisers Act,
                under any other statute, at common law or otherwise, arising
               out of the Sub-Adviser's responsibilities as Sub-Adviser of
            the Series which (1) may be based upon the Sub-Adviser's
        negligence, willful misfeasance, or bad faith in the
              performance of its duties (which could include a negligent
               action or a negligent omission to act), or by reason of the
                  Sub-Adviser's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties
             under this Agreement, or (2) may be based upon any untrue
            statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
                  contained in the Registration Statement or prospectus covering
             the shares of the Fund or any Series, or any amendment or
              supplement thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to
                 state therein a material fact known or which should have been
                  known to the Sub-Adviser and was required to be stated therein
                  or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if
          such a statement or omission was made in reliance upon
          information furnished to the Manager, the Fund, or any
                  affiliated person of the Manager or Fund by the Sub-Adviser or
                any affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser; provided, however,
             that in no case shall the indemnity in favor of a Manager
               Indemnified Person be deemed to protect such person against
any liability to which any such person would

B-4 

P-->DEFS14A65th Page of 90TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 65th
              otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
                faith, gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or
              by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and
duties under this Agreement.                

           (c) The Manager shall not be liable under Paragraph (a) of this
       Section 13 with respect to any claim made against a
          Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person unless such Sub-Adviser
                 Indemnified Person shall have notified the Manager in writing
             within a reasonable time after the summons or other first
               legal process giving information of the nature of the claim
            shall have been served upon such Sub-Adviser Indemnified
              Person (or after such Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person shall
                  have received notice of such service on any designated agent),
                 but failure to notify the Manager of any such claim shall not
               relieve the Manager from any liability which it may have to
                  the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person against whom such action is
                 brought except to the extent the Manager is prejudiced by the
            failure or delay in giving such notice. In case any such
                 action is brought against the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person,
           the Manager will be entitled to participate, at its own
           expense, in the defense thereof or, after notice to the
                  Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person, to assume the defense thereof,
            with counsel satisfactory to the Sub-Adviser Indemnified
                 Person. If the Manager assumes the defense of any such action
                and the selection of counsel by the Manager to represent the
                  Manager and the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person would result in
            a conflict of interests and therefore, would not, in the
              reasonable judgment of the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person,
         adequately represent the interests of the Sub-Adviser
             Indemnified Person, the Manager will, at its own expense,
               assume the defense with counsel to the Manager and, also at
             its own expense, with separate counsel to the Sub-Adviser
                  Indemnified Person, which counsel shall be satisfactory to the
          Manager and to the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person. The
          Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person shall bear the fees and
              expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and the
              Manager shall not be liable to the Sub-Adviser Indemnified
               Person under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses
               subsequently incurred by the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person
              independently in connection with the defense thereof other
                 than reasonable costs of investigation. The Manager shall not
            have the right to compromise on or settle the litigation
        without the prior written consent of the Sub-Adviser
                  Indemnified Person if the compromise or settlement results, or
            may result in a finding of wrongdoing on the part of the
Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person.             

          (d) The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable under Paragraph (b) of
            this Section 13 with respect to any claim made against a
              Manager Indemnified Person unless such Manager Indemnified
                  Person shall have notified the Sub-Adviser in writing within a
                  reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process
                 giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been
              served upon such Manager Indemnified Person (or after such
                 Manager Indemnified Person shall have received notice of such
               service on any designated agent), but failure to notify the
       Sub-Adviser of any such claim shall not relieve the
           Sub-Adviser from any liability which it may have to the
                  Manager Indemnified Person against whom such action is brought
             except to the extent the Sub-Adviser is prejudiced by the
            failure or delay in giving such notice. In case any such
                 action is brought against the Manager Indemnified Person, the
           Sub-Adviser will be entitled to participate, at its own
           expense, in the defense thereof or, after notice to the
              Manager Indemnified Person, to assume the defense thereof,
                with counsel satisfactory to the Manager Indemnified Person.
                 If the Sub-Adviser assumes the defense of any such action and
                 the selection of counsel by the Sub-Adviser to represent both
            the Sub-Adviser and the Manager Indemnified Person would
                  result in a conflict of interests and therefore, would not, in
              the reasonable judgment of the Manager Indemnified Person,
                 adequately represent the interests of the Manager Indemnified
                Person, the Sub-Adviser will, at its own expense, assume the
                defense with counsel to the Sub-Adviser and, also at its own
             expense, with separate counsel to the Manager Indemnified
                  Person, which counsel shall be satisfactory to the Sub-Adviser
                  and to the Manager Indemnified Person. The Manager Indemnified
             Person shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional
            counsel retained by it, and the Sub-Adviser shall not be
                 liable to the Manager Indemnified Person under this Agreement
                for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
               Manager Indemnified Person independently in connection with
      the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
              investigation. The Sub-Adviser shall not have the right to
            compromise on or settle the litigation without the prior
            written consent of the Manager Indemnified Person if the
                compromise or settlement results, or may result in a finding
                of wrongdoing on the part of the Manager Indemnified Person.

             indicated above, subject to the condition that the Fund's
                 Board of Trustees, including a majority of those Trustees who
              are not interested persons (as such term is defined in the
        1940 Act) of the Manager or the Sub-Adviser, and the
         shareholders of each Series, shall have approved this
         Agreement. Unless terminated as provided herein, this
           Agreement shall remain in full force and effect through
                December 31, 2002 and continue on an annual basis thereafter
          with respect to each Series covered by this Agreement;
                  provided that such annual continuance is specifically approved
                 each year by (a) the Board of Trustees of the Fund, or by the
               vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as
                  defined in the 1940 Act) of each Series, and (b) the vote of a
          majority of those Trustees who are not parties to this
               Agreement or interested persons (as such term is defined in
             the 1940 Act) of any such party to this Agreement cast in
                person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such
            approval. However, any approval of this Agreement by the
                  holders of a majority of the outstanding shares (as defined in
                 the 1940 Act) of a Series shall be effective to continue this
                  Agreement with respect to such Series notwithstanding (i) that
            this Agreement has not been approved by the holders of a
                  majority of the outstanding shares of any other Series or (ii)
that this agreement has

                  not been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding
                 shares of the Fund, unless such approval shall be required by
              any other applicable law or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
               foregoing, this Agreement may be terminated with respect to
               any Series covered by this Agreement: (a) by the Manager at
         any time, upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the
                Sub-Adviser and the Fund, (b) at any time without payment of
                 any penalty by the Fund, by the Fund's Board of Trustees or a
                 majority of the outstanding voting securities of each Series,
               upon sixty (60) days' written notice to the Manager and the
                 Sub-Adviser, or (c) by the Sub-Adviser upon three (3) months'
          written notice unless the Fund or the Manager requests
                 additional time to find a replacement for the Sub-Adviser, in
              which case the Sub-Adviser shall allow the additional time
            requested by the Fund or Manager not to exceed three (3)
           additional months beyond the initial three-month notice
                 period; provided, however, that the Sub-Adviser may terminate
              this Agreement at any time without penalty, effective upon
            written notice to the Manager and the Fund, in the event
                either the Sub-Adviser (acting in good faith) or the Manager
              ceases to be registered as an investment adviser under the
          Advisers Act or otherwise becomes legally incapable of
            providing investment management services pursuant to its
                  respective contract with the Fund, or in the event the Manager
               becomes bankrupt or otherwise incapable of carrying out its
              obligations under this Agreement, or in the event that the
              Sub-Adviser does not receive compensation for its services
                 from the Manager or the Fund as required by the terms of this
agreement.                                  

              In the event of termination for any reason, all records of
           each Series for which the Agreement is terminated shall
                  promptly be returned to the Manager or the Fund, free from any
           claim or retention of rights in such record by the Sub-
              Adviser, although the Sub-Adviser may, at its own expense,
                make and retain a copy of such records. This Agreement shall
              automatically terminate in the event of its assignment (as
              such term is described in the 1940 Act). In the event this
            Agreement is terminated or is not approved in the manner
                  described above, the Sections or Paragraphs numbered 8, 9, 10,
              11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall remain in effect, as
                well as any applicable provision of this Section numbered 14
        and, to the extent that only amounts are owed to the
               Sub-Adviser as compensation for services rendered while the
agreement was in effect, Section 6.

 EXHIBIT C
FORM OF SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENT

AGREEMENT made this ____ day of ________, 2001 between ING Pilgrim Investments, 
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Manager"), and Elijah Asset     
Management, LLC a [corporate form] (the "Sub-Adviser").                         

WHEREAS, [Name of Registrant] (the "Fund") is registered under the Investment   
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as an open-end, management    
investment company;                                                             

WHEREAS, the Fund is authorized to issue separate series, each series having its
own investment objective or objectives, policies, and limitations;              

WHEREAS, the Fund may offer shares of additional series in the future;          

WHEREAS, pursuant to an Investment Management Agreement, dated the date hereof  
(the "Management Agreement"), a copy of which has been provided to the          
Sub-Adviser, the Fund has retained the Manager to render advisory and management
services with respect to certain of the Fund's series; and                      

WHEREAS, pursuant to authority granted to the Manager in the Management         
Agreement, the Manager wishes to retain the Sub-Adviser to furnish investment   
advisory services to one or more of the series of the Fund, and the Sub-Adviser 
is willing to furnish such services to the Fund and the Manager;                

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the promises and mutual    
covenants herein contained, it is agreed between the Manager and the Sub-Adviser
as follows:                                                                     

    1.    Appointment. The Manager hereby appoints the Sub-Adviser to act as
        the investment adviser and manager to the series of the Fund set
            forth on Schedule A hereto (the "Series") for the periods and on the
       terms set forth in this Agreement. The Sub-Adviser accepts such
           appointment and agrees to furnish the services herein set forth for
the compensation herein provided.                       

           In the event the Fund designates one or more series (other than the
      Series) with respect to which the Manager wishes to retain the
        Sub-Adviser to render investment advisory services hereunder, it
      shall notify the Sub-Adviser in writing. If the Sub-Adviser is
       willing to render such services, it shall notify the Manager in
           writing, whereupon such series shall become a Series hereunder, and
be subject to this Agreement.                           

    2.    Sub-Adviser Duties. Subject to the supervision of the Fund's Board
   of Trustees and the Manager, the Sub-Adviser will provide a
    continuous investment program for each Series' portfolio and
         determine in its discretion the composition of the assets of each
   Series' portfolio, including determination of the purchase,
         retention, or sale of the securities, cash, and other investments
           contained in the portfolio. The Sub-Adviser will provide investment
            research and conduct a continuous program of evaluation, investment,
         sales, and reinvestment of each Series' assets by determining the
         securities and other investments that shall be purchased, entered
   into, sold, closed, or exchanged for the Series, when these
          transactions should be executed, and what portion of the assets of
     the Series should be held in the various securities and other
          investments in which it may invest. To the extent permitted by the
      investment policies of each Series, the Sub-Adviser shall make
        decisions for the Series as to foreign currency matters and make
     determinations as to and execute and perform foreign currency
        exchange contracts on behalf of the Series. The Sub-Adviser will
         provide the services under this Agreement in accordance with each
 Series' investment objective or objectives, policies, and
         restrictions as stated in the Fund's Registration Statement filed
        with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), as amended,
       copies of which shall be sent to the Sub-Adviser by the Manager
          prior to the commencement of this Agreement and promptly following
      any such amendment. The Sub-Adviser further agrees as follows:

          (a)   The Sub-Adviser will conform with the 1940 Act and all rules
                and regulations thereunder, all other applicable federal and
              state laws and regulations, with any applicable procedures
        adopted by the Fund's Board of Trustees of which the
               Sub-Adviser has been sent a copy, and the provisions of the
                 Registration Statement of the Fund filed under the Securities
                  Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") and the 1940 Act, as supplemented
                 or amended, of which the Sub-Adviser has received a copy, and
               with the Manager's portfolio manager operating policies and
                procedures as in effect on the date hereof, as such policies
               and procedures may be revised or amended by the Manager and
                  agreed to by the Sub-Adviser. In carrying out its duties under
               the Sub-Adviser Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will comply with
the following policies and procedures:      

                  (i)   The Sub-Adviser will manage each Series so that it meets
                    the income and asset diversification requirements of
         Section 851 of the Internal Revenue Code.

               (ii)  The Sub-Adviser will vote all proxies solicited by or
                      with respect to the issuers of securities which assets
              of the Series are invested consistent with any
                        procedures or guidelines promulgated by the Board or the
             Manager, or if none, in the discretion of the
                        Sub-Adviser based upon the best interests of the Series.
                 The Sub-Adviser will maintain appropriate records
                     detailing its voting of proxies on behalf of the Fund
                        and will provide to the Fund at least quarterly a report
                        setting forth the proposals voted on and how the Series'
                       shares were voted since the prior report, including the
  name of the corresponding issuers.

                (iii) In connection with the purchase and sale of securities
                     for each Series, the Sub-Adviser will arrange for the
                      transmission to the custodian and portfolio accounting
           agent for the Series on a daily basis, such
                    confirmation, trade tickets, and other documents and
                  information, including, but not limited to, Cusip,
                      Cedel, or other numbers that identify securities to be
                    purchased or sold on behalf of the Series, as may be
                reasonably necessary to enable the custodian and
                        portfolio accounting agent to perform its administrative
                      and recordkeeping responsibilities with respect to the
                  Series. With respect to portfolio securities to be
                 settled through the Depository Trust Company, the
                       Sub-Adviser will arrange for the prompt transmission of
                       the confirmation of such trades to the Fund's custodian
and portfolio accounting agent. 

                 (iv)  The Sub-Adviser will assist the custodian and portfolio
               accounting agent for the Fund in determining or
                       confirming, consistent with the procedures and policies
                    stated in the Registration Statement for the Fund or
                  adopted by the Board of Trustees, the value of any
                      portfolio securities or other assets of the Series for
                        which the custodian and portfolio accounting agent seeks
               assistance from or identifies for review by the
             Sub-Adviser. The parties acknowledge that the
                        Sub-Adviser is not a custodian of the Series' assets and
                   will not take possession or custody of such assets.

                 (v)   The Sub-Adviser will provide the Manager, no later than
                   the 20th day following the end of each of the first
                     three fiscal quarters of each Series and the 45th day
                       following the end of each Series' fiscal year, a letter
                       to shareholders (to be subject to review and editing by
                     the Manager) containing a discussion of those factors
                 referred to in Item 5(a) of 1940 Act Form N-1A in
                        respect of both the prior quarter and the fiscal year to
date.                           

                  (vi)  The Sub-Adviser will complete and deliver to the Manager
                        a written compliance checklist in a form provided by the
                       Manager for each month by the 10th day of the following
month.                          

                 (vii) The parties agree that in the event that the Manager or
               an affiliated person of the Manager sends sales
               literature or other promotional material to the
                        Sub-Adviser for its approval and the Sub-Adviser has not
                        commented within 10 days, the Manager and its affiliated
                       persons may use and distribute such sales literature or
other promotional material.     

     (b)   The Sub-Adviser will make available to the Fund and the
                 Manager, promptly upon request, any of the Series' investment
                  records and ledgers maintained by the Sub-Adviser (which shall
         not include the records and ledgers maintained by the
                custodian or portfolio accounting agent for the Fund) as are
               necessary to assist the Fund and the Manager to comply with
                requirements of the 1940 Act and the Investment Advisers Act
             of 1940 (the "Advisers Act"), as well as other applicable
                laws. The Sub-Adviser will furnish to regulatory authorities
                having the requisite authority any information or reports in
                connection with such services in respect to the Series which
                 may be requested in order to ascertain whether the operations
               of the Fund are being conducted in a manner consistent with
applicable laws and regulations.            

         (c)   The Sub-Adviser will provide reports to the Fund's Board of
              Trustees for consideration at meetings of the Board on the
          investment program for each Series and the issuers and
              securities represented in each Series' portfolio, and will
             furnish the Fund's Board of Trustees with respect to each
                Series such periodic and special reports as the Trustees and
the Manager may reasonably request.         

3.    Broker-Dealer Selection. The Sub-Adviser is authorized to make
           decisions to buy and sell securities and other investments for each
      Series' portfolio, broker-dealer selection, and negotiation of
           brokerage commission rates in effecting a security transaction. The
   Sub-Adviser's primary consideration in effecting a security
        transaction will be to obtain the best execution for the Series,
          taking into account the factors specified in the prospectus and/or
           statement of additional information for the Fund, and determined in
         consultation with the Manager, which include price (including the
          applicable brokerage commission or dollar spread), the size of the
           order, the nature of the market for the security, the timing of the
           transaction, the reputation, the experience and financial stability
      of the broker-dealer involved, the quality of the service, the
   difficulty of execution, and the execution capabilities and
           operational facilities of the firm involved, and the firm's risk in
      positioning a block of securities. Accordingly, the price to a
           Series in any transaction may be less favorable than that available
  from another broker-dealer if the difference is reasonably
            justified, in the judgment of the Sub-Adviser in the exercise of its
            fiduciary obligations to the Fund, by other aspects of the portfolio
          execution services offered. Subject to such policies as the Fund's
      Board of Trustees or Manager may determine and consistent with
Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of         

C-2

          1934, the Sub-Adviser shall not be deemed to have acted unlawfully
           or to have breached any duty created by this Agreement or otherwise
solely by reason of its having caused a Series to pay a 
         broker-dealer for effecting a portfolio investment transaction in
           excess of the amount of commission another broker-dealer would have
  charged for effecting that transaction, if the Sub-Adviser
   determines in good faith that such amount of commission was
         reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research
          services provided by such broker-dealer, viewed in terms of either
         that particular transaction or the Sub-Adviser's or the Manager's
        overall responsibilities with respect to the Series and to their
     respective other clients as to which they exercise investment
            discretion. The Sub-Adviser will consult with the Manager to the end
         that portfolio transactions on behalf of a Series are directed to
     broker-dealers on the basis of criteria reasonably considered
       appropriate by the Manager. To the extent consistent with these
        standards, the Sub-Adviser is further authorized to allocate the
          orders placed by it on behalf of a Series to the Sub-Adviser if it
       is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, to an affiliated
      broker-dealer, or to such brokers and dealers who also provide
          research or statistical material, or other services to the Series,
            the Sub-Adviser, or an affiliate of the Sub-Adviser. Such allocation
         shall be in such amounts and proportions as the Sub-Adviser shall
          determine consistent with the above standards, and the Sub-Adviser
       will report on said allocation regularly to the Fund's Board of
        Trustees indicating the broker-dealers to which such allocations
have been made and the basis therefor.                  

     4.    Disclosure about Sub-Adviser. The Sub-Adviser has reviewed the most
         recent Post-Effective Amendment to the Registration Statement for
      the Fund filed with the SEC that contains disclosure about the
          Sub-Adviser, and represents and warrants that, with respect to the
          disclosure about the Sub-Adviser or information relating, directly
      or indirectly, to the Sub-Adviser, such Registration Statement
            contains, as of the date hereof, no untrue statement of any material
         fact and does not omit any statement of a material fact which was
         required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
         were made, not misleading. The Sub-Adviser further represents and
          warrants that it is a duly registered investment adviser under the
        Advisers Act and will maintain such registration so long as this
     Agreement remains in effect. The Sub-Adviser will provide the
         Manager with a copy of the Sub-Adviser's Form ADV, Part II at the
time the Form ADV is filed with the SEC.                

   5.    Expenses. During the term of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser will
   pay all expenses incurred by it and its staff and for their
           activities in connection with its portfolio management duties under
            this Agreement. The Manager or the Fund shall be responsible for all
the expenses of the Fund's operations.                  

     6.    Compensation. For the services provided to each Series, the Manager
            will pay the Sub-Adviser an annual fee equal to the amount specified
         for such Series in Schedule A hereto, payable monthly in arrears.
          The fee will be appropriately prorated to reflect any portion of a
     calendar month that this Agreement is not in effect among the
    parties. In accordance with the provisions of the Management
            Agreement, the Manager is solely responsible for the payment of fees
         to the Sub-Adviser, and the Sub-Adviser agrees to seek payment of
        its fees solely from the Manager; provided, however, that if the
            Fund fails to pay the Manager all or a portion of the management fee
         under said Management Agreement when due, and the amount that was
      paid is insufficient to cover the Sub-Adviser's fee under this
      Agreement for the period in question, then the Sub-Adviser may
        enforce against the Fund any rights it may have as a third-party
            beneficiary under the Management Agreement and the Manager will take
           all steps appropriate under the circumstances to collect the amount
due from the Fund.                                      

7.    Compliance.                                                   

            (a)   The Sub-Adviser agrees to use reasonable compliance techniques
                as the Manager or the Board of Trustees may adopt, including
any written compliance procedures.          

      (b)   The Sub-Adviser agrees that it shall promptly notify the
          Manager and the Fund (1) in the event that the SEC has
         censured the Sub-Adviser; placed limitations upon its
                 activities, functions or operations; suspended or revoked its
           registration as an investment adviser; or has commenced
             proceedings or an investigation that may result in any of
            these actions, or (2) upon having a reasonable basis for
                believing that the Series has ceased to qualify or might not
                qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M
                of the Internal Revenue Code. The Sub-Adviser further agrees
               to notify the Manager and the Fund promptly of any material
               fact known to the Sub-Adviser respecting or relating to the
         Sub-Adviser that is not contained in the Registration
             Statement or prospectus for the Fund (which describes the
              Series), or any amendment or supplement thereto, or if any
          statement contained therein that becomes untrue in any
material respect.                           

  (c)   The Manager agrees that it shall promptly notify the
              Sub-Adviser (1) in the event that the SEC has censured the
                Manager or the Fund; placed limitations upon either of their
                  activities, functions, or operations; suspended or revoked the
           Manager's registration as an investment adviser; or has
                commenced proceedings or an investigation that may result in
               any of these actions, or (2) upon having a reasonable basis
                for believing that the Series has ceased to qualify or might
                  not qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter
M of the Internal Revenue Code.

   8.    Books and Records. The Sub-Adviser hereby agrees that all records
          which it maintains for the Series are the property of the Fund and
            further agrees to surrender promptly to the Fund any of such records
       upon the Fund's or the Manager's request in compliance with the
   requirements of Rule 31a-3 under the 1940 Act, although the
           Sub-Adviser may, at its own expense, make and retain a copy of such
           records. The Sub-Adviser further agrees to preserve for the periods
           prescribed by Rule 31a-2 under the 1940 Act the records required to
be maintained by Rule 31a-l under the 1940 Act.         

      9.    Cooperation; Confidentiality. Each party to this Agreement agrees to
            cooperate with the other party and with all appropriate governmental
         authorities having the requisite jurisdiction (including, but not
            limited to, the SEC) in connection with any investigation or inquiry
         relating to this Agreement or the Fund. Subject to the foregoing,
   the Sub-Adviser shall treat as confidential all information
           pertaining to the Fund and actions of the Fund, the Manager and the
        Sub-Adviser, and the Manager shall treat as confidential and use
           only in connection with the Series all information furnished to the
      Fund or the Manager by the Sub-Adviser, in connection with its
        duties under the agreement except that the aforesaid information
       need not be treated as confidential if required to be disclosed
          under applicable law, if generally available to the public through
            means other than by disclosure by the Sub-Adviser or the Manager, or
         if available from a source other than the Manager, Sub-Adviser or
this Fund.                                              

 10.   Representations Respecting Sub-Adviser. The Manager agrees that
         neither the Manager, nor affiliated persons of the Manager, shall
         give any information or make any representations or statements in
       connection with the sale of shares of the Series concerning the
Sub-Adviser or the Series other than the information or 
            representations contained in the Registration Statement, prospectus,
        or statement of additional information for the Fund's shares, as
            they may be amended or supplemented from time to time, or in reports
         or proxy statements for the Fund, or in sales literature or other
           promotional material approved in advance by the Sub-Adviser, except
with the prior permission of the Sub-Adviser.           

      11.   Control. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, it is
         understood and agreed that the Fund shall at all times retain the
          ultimate responsibility for and control of all functions performed
           pursuant to this Agreement and has reserved the right to reasonably
           direct any action hereunder taken on its behalf by the Sub-Adviser.

   12.   Liability. Except as may otherwise be required by the 1940 Act or
        the rules thereunder or other applicable law, the Manager agrees
           that the Sub-Adviser, any affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser, and
         each person, if any, who, within the meaning of Section 15 of the
          1933 Act controls the Sub-Adviser (1) shall bear no responsibility
         and shall not be subject to any liability for any act or omission
         respecting any series of the Fund that is not a Series hereunder,
   and (2) shall not be liable for, or subject to any damages,
   expenses, or losses in connection with, any act or omission
         connected with or arising out of any services rendered under this
         Agreement, except by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or
        negligence in the performance of the Sub-Adviser's duties, or by
         reason of reckless disregard of the Sub-Adviser's obligations and
duties under this Agreement.                            

13.   Indemnification.                                              

   (a)   The Manager agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
              Sub-Adviser, any affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser, and
                 each person, if any, who, within the meaning of Section 15 of
                the 1933 Act controls ("controlling person") the Sub-Adviser
          (all of such persons being referred to as "Sub-Adviser
             Indemnified Persons") against any and all losses, claims,
                  damages, liabilities, or litigation (including legal and other
                  expenses) to which a Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person may become
               subject under the 1933 Act, the 1940 Act, the Advisers Act,
                under any other statute, at common law or otherwise, arising
               out of the Manager's responsibilities to the Fund which (1)
       may be based upon the Manager's negligence, willful
              misfeasance, or bad faith in the performance of its duties
          (which could include a negligent action or a negligent
            omission to act), or by reason of the Manager's reckless
                 disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement,
            or (2) may be based upon any untrue statement or alleged
        untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
               Registration Statement or prospectus covering shares of the
                  Fund or any Series, or any amendment thereof or any supplement
                 thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to state therein
                 a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
           make the statements therein not misleading, unless such
               statement or omission was made in reliance upon information
             furnished to the Manager or the Fund or to any affiliated
              person of the Manager by a Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person;
                  provided however, that in no case shall the indemnity in favor
              of the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person be deemed to protect
              such person against any liability to which any such person
                would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance,
            bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its
                 duties, or by reason of its reckless disregard of obligations
and duties under this Agreement.            

           (b)   Notwithstanding Section 12 of this Agreement, the Sub-Adviser
          agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Manager, any
                affiliated person of the Manager, and any controlling person
            of the Manager (all of such persons being referred to as
              "Manager Indemnified Persons") against any and all losses,
                claims, damages, liabilities, or litigation (including legal
                 and other expenses) to which a Manager Indemnified Person may
                  become subject under the 1933 Act, 1940 Act, the Advisers Act,
                under any other statute, at common law or otherwise, arising
out of the Sub-Adviser's responsibilities as

             Sub-Adviser of the Series which (1) may be based upon the
                  Sub-Adviser's negligence, willful misfeasance, or bad faith in
                  the performance of its duties (which could include a negligent
               action or a negligent omission to act), or by reason of the
                  Sub-Adviser's reckless disregard of its obligations and duties
             under this Agreement, or (2) may be based upon any untrue
            statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
                  contained in the Registration Statement or prospectus covering
             the shares of the Fund or any Series, or any amendment or
              supplement thereto, or the omission or alleged omission to
                 state therein a material fact known or which should have been
                  known to the Sub-Adviser and was required to be stated therein
                  or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, if
          such a statement or omission was made in reliance upon
          information furnished to the Manager, the Fund, or any
                  affiliated person of the Manager or Fund by the Sub-Adviser or
                any affiliated person of the Sub-Adviser; provided, however,
             that in no case shall the indemnity in favor of a Manager
               Indemnified Person be deemed to protect such person against
             any liability to which any such person would otherwise be
              subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
                negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of
              its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under
this Agreement.                             

         (c)   The Manager shall not be liable under Paragraph (a) of this
       Section 13 with respect to any claim made against a
          Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person unless such Sub-Adviser
                 Indemnified Person shall have notified the Manager in writing
             within a reasonable time after the summons or other first
               legal process giving information of the nature of the claim
            shall have been served upon such Sub-Adviser Indemnified
              Person (or after such Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person shall
                  have received notice of such service on any designated agent),
                 but failure to notify the Manager of any such claim shall not
               relieve the Manager from any liability which it may have to
                  the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person against whom such action is
                 brought except to the extent the Manager is prejudiced by the
            failure or delay in giving such notice. In case any such
                 action is brought against the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person,
           the Manager will be entitled to participate, at its own
           expense, in the defense thereof or, after notice to the
                  Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person, to assume the defense thereof,
            with counsel satisfactory to the Sub-Adviser Indemnified
                 Person. If the Manager assumes the defense of any such action
                and the selection of counsel by the Manager to represent the
                  Manager and the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person would result in
            a conflict of interests and therefore, would not, in the
              reasonable judgment of the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person,
         adequately represent the interests of the Sub-Adviser
             Indemnified Person, the Manager will, at its own expense,
               assume the defense with counsel to the Manager and, also at
             its own expense, with separate counsel to the Sub-Adviser
                  Indemnified Person, which counsel shall be satisfactory to the
          Manager and to the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person. The
          Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person shall bear the fees and
              expenses of any additional counsel retained by it, and the
              Manager shall not be liable to the Sub-Adviser Indemnified
               Person under this Agreement for any legal or other expenses
               subsequently incurred by the Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person
              independently in connection with the defense thereof other
                 than reasonable costs of investigation. The Manager shall not
            have the right to compromise on or settle the litigation
        without the prior written consent of the Sub-Adviser
                  Indemnified Person if the compromise or settlement results, or
            may result in a finding of wrongdoing on the part of the
Sub-Adviser Indemnified Person.             

        (d)   The Sub-Adviser shall not be liable under Paragraph (b) of
            this Section 13 with respect to any claim made against a
              Manager Indemnified Person unless such Manager Indemnified
                  Person shall have notified the Sub-Adviser in writing within a
                  reasonable time after the summons or other first legal process
                 giving information of the nature of the claim shall have been
              served upon such Manager Indemnified Person (or after such
                 Manager Indemnified Person shall have received notice of such
               service on any designated agent), but failure to notify the
       Sub-Adviser of any such claim shall not relieve the
           Sub-Adviser from any liability which it may have to the
                  Manager Indemnified Person against whom such action is brought
             except to the extent the Sub-Adviser is prejudiced by the
            failure or delay in giving such notice. In case any such
                 action is brought against the Manager Indemnified Person, the
           Sub-Adviser will be entitled to participate, at its own
           expense, in the defense thereof or, after notice to the
              Manager Indemnified Person, to assume the defense thereof,
                with counsel satisfactory to the Manager Indemnified Person.
                 If the Sub-Adviser assumes the defense of any such action and
                 the selection of counsel by the Sub-Adviser to represent both
            the Sub-Adviser and the Manager Indemnified Person would
                  result in a conflict of interests and therefore, would not, in
              the reasonable judgment of the Manager Indemnified Person,
                 adequately represent the interests of the Manager Indemnified
                Person, the Sub-Adviser will, at its own expense, assume the
                defense with counsel to the Sub-Adviser and, also at its own
             expense, with separate counsel to the Manager Indemnified
                  Person, which counsel shall be satisfactory to the Sub-Adviser
                  and to the Manager Indemnified Person. The Manager Indemnified
             Person shall bear the fees and expenses of any additional
            counsel retained by it, and the Sub-Adviser shall not be
                 liable to the Manager Indemnified Person under this Agreement
                for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
               Manager Indemnified Person independently in connection with
      the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
              investigation. The Sub-Adviser shall not have the right to
            compromise on or settle the litigation without the prior
            written consent of the Manager Indemnified Person if the
                compromise or settlement results, or may result in a finding
                of wrongdoing on the part of the Manager Indemnified Person.

     (a)   This Agreement shall become effective on the date first
             indicated above, subject to the condition that the Fund's
                 Board of Trustees, including a majority of those Trustees who

        1940 Act) of the Manager or the Sub-Adviser, and the
         shareholders of each Series, shall have approved this
         Agreement. Unless terminated as provided herein, this
           Agreement shall remain in full force and effect through
                December 31, 2002 and continue on an annual basis thereafter
          with respect to each Series covered by this Agreement;
                  provided that such annual continuance is specifically approved
                 each year by (a) the Board of Trustees of the Fund, or by the
               vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as
                  defined in the 1940 Act) of each Series, and (b) the vote of a
          majority of those Trustees who are not parties to this
               Agreement or interested persons (as such term is defined in
             the 1940 Act) of any such party to this Agreement cast in
                person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such
            approval. However, any approval of this Agreement by the
                  holders of a majority of the outstanding shares (as defined in
                 the 1940 Act) of a Series shall be effective to continue this
                  Agreement with respect to such Series notwithstanding (i) that
            this Agreement has not been approved by the holders of a
                  majority of the outstanding shares of any other Series or (ii)
              that this agreement has not been approved by the vote of a
               majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund, unless such
             approval shall be required by any other applicable law or
                otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may
            be terminated with respect to any Series covered by this
              Agreement: (a) by the Manager at any time, upon sixty (60)
                days' written notice to the Sub-Adviser and the Fund, (b) at
               any time without payment of any penalty by the Fund, by the
             Fund's Board of Trustees or a majority of the outstanding
           voting securities of each Series, upon sixty (60) days'
                written notice to the Manager and the Sub-Adviser, or (c) by
                the Sub-Adviser upon three (3) months' written notice unless
              the Fund or the Manager requests additional time to find a
                  replacement for the Sub-Adviser, in which case the Sub-Adviser
            shall allow the additional time requested by the Fund or
                Manager not to exceed three (3) additional months beyond the
                  initial three-month notice period; provided, however, that the
                Sub-Adviser may terminate this Agreement at any time without
                 penalty, effective upon written notice to the Manager and the
             Fund, in the event either the Sub-Adviser (acting in good
                  faith) or the Manager ceases to be registered as an investment
               adviser under the Advisers Act or otherwise becomes legally
                  incapable of providing investment management services pursuant
                 to its respective contract with the Fund, or in the event the
               Manager becomes bankrupt or otherwise incapable of carrying
                  out its obligations under this Agreement, or in the event that
                  the Sub-Adviser does not receive compensation for its services
                 from the Manager or the Fund as required by the terms of this
agreement.                                  

              In the event of termination for any reason, all records of
           each Series for which the Agreement is terminated shall
                  promptly be returned to the Manager or the Fund, free from any
      claim or retention of rights in such record by the
                  Sub-Adviser, although the Sub-Adviser may, at its own expense,
                make and retain a copy of such records. This Agreement shall
              automatically terminate in the event of its assignment (as
              such term is described in the 1940 Act). In the event this
            Agreement is terminated or is not approved in the manner
                  described above, the Sections or Paragraphs numbered 8, 9, 10,
              11, 12 and 13 of this Agreement shall remain in effect, as

of the Corporation and shall include those set forth [end strikethru]as 
follows:                                                                

           (a)   Assets Belonging to the Series. All consideration received by

              in which such consideration is invested or reinvested, all
                  income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof, including any
              proceeds derived from the sale, exchange or liquidation of
           such assets, and any funds or payments derived from any
               reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever form the same may
               be, shall irrevocably belong to the [begin strikethru]S[end
                  strikethru]Series for all purposes, subject only to the rights
                  of creditors OF THAT SERIES AND TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
                EACH CLASS (IF ANY) OF THAT SERIES, and shall be so recorded
        upon the books and accounts of the Corporation. Such
                 consideration, assets, income, earnings, profits and proceeds
          thereof, including any proceeds derived from the sale,

          which are not readily identifiable as belonging to any
        particular [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series
                (collectively, "General Items"), such General Items shall be
         allocated by or under the supervision of the Board of

              particular [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series shall
                  belong to that [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series. Each
                 such allocation by the Board of Directors shall be conclusive
and binding for all purposes.               

 (b)   Liabilities Belonging to [begin strikethru]the [end

                 strikethru]Series and which shall be allocated and charged by
             or under the supervision of the Board of Directors to and
        among any one or more of the [begin strikethru]S[end
                  strikethru]Series of the Corporation from time to time in such
              manner and on such basis as the Board of Directors, in its
                 sole discretion, deems fair and equitable; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
          THAT IDENTIFIED COSTS, EXPENSES, CHARGES, RESERVES AND
             LIABILITIES PROPERLY ALLOCABLE TO A PARTICULAR CLASS OF A
             SERIES, AS DETERMINED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SHALL BE
               CHARGED TO AND BORNE SOLELY BY SUCH CLASS. The liabilities,
                  expenses, costs, charges and reserves allocated and so charged
                 to the [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS are
               herein referred to as "liabilities belonging to" the [begin

             liabilities, expenses, costs, charges and reserves by the
              Board of Directors shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes.                                   

        (c)   Income Belonging to [begin strikethru]the [end strikethru]

                  and each such determination and allocation shall be conclusive
                  and binding. "Income belonging to" the [begin strikethru]S[end
                strikethru]Series OR CLASS includes all income, earnings and
       profits derived from assets belonging to the [begin
         strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS, less any
                expenses, costs, charges or reserves belonging to the [begin
                 strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS, for the relevant
time period.                                

(d)   Dividends. Dividends and distributions on [begin  
strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of [begin
             strikethru]the [end strikethru] A [begin strikethru]S[end

              frequency, in such form and in such amount as the Board of
               Directors may from time to time determine. Dividends may be
                 declared daily or otherwise pursuant to a standing resolution
                  or resolutions adopted only once or with such frequency as the
                Board of Directors may determine, after providing for actual
   and accrued liabilities belonging to the [begin
strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS.

         All dividends on Shares of [begin strikethru]the [end
             strikethru]A [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR
               CLASS shall be paid only out of the income belonging to the
           [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS, and
       capital gains distributions on Shares of the [begin

               strikethru]Series OR CLASS shall be distributed pro rata to
             the holders of such Shares in proportion to the number of

                 distributions, except that in connection with any dividend or
                 distribution program or procedure, the Board of Directors may
                  determine that no dividend or distribution shall be payable on
              Shares as to which the shareholder's purchase order and/or
       payment have not been received by the time or times
               established by the Board of Directors under such program or
procedure.                                  

            The Board of Directors shall have the power, in its sole
              discretion, to distribute in any fiscal year as dividends,
                 including dividends designated in whole or in part as capital

                 the authority of the Board of Directors to make distributions
                  greater than or less than the amount necessary to qualify as a
              regulated investment company and to avoid liability of the
               Corporation or [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR
CLASS for such tax.

                 to any program that the Board of Directors may have in effect
                 at the time. Any such dividend or distribution paid in [begin

                 DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS DECLARED AND PAID WITH RESPECT TO

                with respect to which a separate vote of a particular [begin
                  strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS is required by the
                  1940 Act or by the MGCL[begin strikethru] Maryland Corporation
                Code[end strikethru], such requirement as to a separate vote
              by that [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS
                  shall apply in lieu of Single Series Voting; (ii) in the event
                 that the separate vote requirements referred to in clause (i)
  above apply with respect to one or more [begin
                  strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASSES, then subject to
   clause (iii) below, the [begin strikethru]s[end
          strikethru]Shares of all other [begin strikethru]S[end
               strikethru]Series AND CLASSES shall vote as a single [begin
                  strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series; and (iii) as to any matter
             which does not affect the interest of a particular [begin
                 strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS, only the holders
              of [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the one or
              more affected [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR
CLASSES shall be entitled to vote.          

(h)   Redemption by Shareholder. Each holder of [begin  
    strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the [begin
                 strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR ANY CLASS THEREOF shall
           have the right at such times as may be permitted by the
               Corporation to require the Corporation to redeem all or any
                part of his or her [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares
                 [begin strikethru]of a particular Series[end strikethru] at a
                 redemption price per [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Share
            equal to the net asset value per [begin strikethru]s[end
    strikethru]Share of that [begin strikethru]S[end
                  strikethru]Series OR CLASS next determined (in accordance with
                  subsection (i)[begin strikethru](h)[end strikethru]) after the
          [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares are properly
                  tendered for redemption. Payment of the proceeds of redemption
              shall be in cash unless the Board of Directors determines,
                  which determination shall be conclusive, that conditions exist
               which make payment wholly in cash unwise or undesirable. In
             the event of such determination, the Corporation may make
          payment wholly or partly in securities or other assets
                 belonging to the [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR
                CLASS at the value of such securities or assets used in such
         determination of net asset value. Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, the Corporation may postpone payment of the
                redemption price and may suspend the right to the holders of
         [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of a [begin
              strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS to require the
 Corporation to redeem [begin strikethru]s[end
     strikethru]Shares of that [begin strikethru]S[end
               strikethru]Series OR CLASS during any period or at any time
          when and to the extent permissible under the 1940 Act.

       (i)   Net Asset Value Per Share. The net asset value per [begin
    strikethru]s[end strikethru]Share of each [begin
               strikethru]S[end strikethru]series OR CLASS, AS APPLICABLE,
               shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the value of the
                net assets of that [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series
           (being the value of the assets belonging to that [begin
           strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series less the liabilities
                  belonging to that [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR
    CLASS) by the total number of outstanding [begin
    strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the [begin
               strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS, AS APPLICABLE.

            (j)   Equality. All [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the
                  [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR ANY CLASS THEREOF
                 shall represent an equal proportionate interest in the assets
              belonging to the [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series
       (subject to the liabilities belonging to the [begin
                strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS) and each [begin
   strikethru]s[end strikethru]Share of the [begin
                 strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS shall be equal to
    each other share of that [begin strikethru]S[end
               strikethru]Series OR CLASS. The Board of Directors may from
              time to time divide or combine the [begin strikethru]s[end
  strikethru]Shares of a [begin strikethru]S[end
                 strikethru]Series OR CLASS into a greater or lesser number of
            [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of that [begin
               strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS without thereby
                changing the proportionate beneficial interest in the assets
                 belonging to the [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series or
        in any way affecting the rights of holders of [begin
          strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of any other [begin
strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS.

           (k)   Conversion or Exchange Rights. Subject to compliance with the
              requirements of the 1940 Act, the Board of Directors shall
        have the authority to provide that holders of [begin
    strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the [begin
                 strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR ANY CLASS THEREOF shall
     have the right to convert or exchange said [begin
                 strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares into shares of one or more
              other [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASSES
                  THEREOF in accordance with such requirements and procedures as
 may be established by the Board of Directors.

       (l)   Redemption by the Corporation. The Board of Directors may
                  cause the Corporation to redeem at current net asset value the
           [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the [begin
                  strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series OR CLASS from a shareholder
           whose [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares have an
         aggregate current net asset value less than an amount
             established by the Board of Directors. No such redemption
          shall be effected unless the Corporation has given the
                shareholder reasonable notice of its intention to redeem the
                [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares and an opportunity
        to purchase a sufficient number of additional [begin
             strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares to bring the aggregate
                 current net asset value of his or her [begin strikethru]s[end
             strikethru]Shares to the minimum amount established. Upon
           redemption of [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares
                pursuant to this section, the Corporation shall cause prompt
                 payment of the full redemption price to be made to the holder
             of [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares so redeemed.

Eighth: The various classes of Shares of each [begin strikethru]S[end   
strikethru]Series designated and classified IN ARTICLE SIXTH shall be   
subject to all provisions of THE Charter of the Corporation relating to 
Shares of the Corporation generally, and those set forth as follows:    

   (a)   The assets of each class of a [begin strikethru]S[end
              strikethru]Series shall be invested in the same investment

      (b)   The dividends and distributions of investment income and
      capital gains with respect to each class of [begin
              strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares OF A SERIES shall be in
                 such amount as may be declared from time to time by the Board
             of Directors, and the dividends and distributions of each
                  class of [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares OF A SERIES
              may vary from the dividends and distributions of the other
                classes of [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares OF SUCH
                  SERIES to reflect differing allocations of the expenses of the
              Corporation among the holders of each class OF SHARES OF A
              SERIES and any resultant differences between the net asset
              value per [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Share of each
                  class OF A SERIES, to such extent and for such purposes as the
              Board of Directors may deem appropriate. The allocation of
       investment income or capital gains and expenses and
                 liabilities of the Corporation among the classes OF SHARES OF
                  EACH SERIES shall be determined by the Board of Directors in a
manner it deems appropriate.                

         (c)   The proceeds of the redemption of [begin strikethru]Class A
              [end strikethru]CERTAIN CLASSES OF [begin strikethru]s[end
     strikethru]Shares of each [begin strikethru]S[end
  strikethru]Series (including fractional [begin
             strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares) may be reduced by the
                  amount of any contingent deferred sales charge payable on such
            redemption pursuant to the terms of the issuance of such
               [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares, AS DETERMINED BY
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.                     

  (d)   The holders of each class of [begin strikethru]s[end
     strikethru]Shares of each [begin strikethru]S[end
                 strikethru]Series shall have (i) exclusive voting rights with
            respect to provisions of any service plan or service and
                 distribution plan adopted by the Corporation pursuant to Rule
         12b-1 under the 1940 Act (a "Plan") applicable to the
              respective class of the respective [begin strikethru]S[end
               strikethru]Series and (ii) no voting rights with respect to

       [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series of [begin
                  strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares or with regard to any other
             matter submitted to a vote of shareholders which does not
             affect holders of that respective class of the respective
       [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series of [begin
strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares.         

   Ninth: THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF SHARES OF AETNA PRINCIPAL PROTECTION FUNDS I,
    II, III AND IV ("APPF I," "APPF II," "APPF III" AND "APPF IV," RESPECTIVELY)
DESIGNATED AND CLASSIFIED IN ARTICLE SIXTH SHALL BE SUBJECT TO ALL      
PROVISIONS OF THE CHARTER OF THE CORPORATION RELATING TO SHARES OF THE  
CORPORATION GENERALLY, AND THOSE SET FORTH AS FOLLOWS:                  

    (a)   In addition to the preferences, rights, voting powers,
              restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications,
            conversion rights and terms and conditions of redemption
              described [begin strikethru]therein [end strikethru]IN THE
           CHARTER OF THE CORPORATION, all [begin strikethru]s[end
               strikethru]Shares of the APPLICABLE [begin strikethru]S[end
                strikethru]Series will be subject to mandatory redemption by
      the Corporation on the Maturity Date of the [begin

          FOR APPF III AND SEPTEMBER 6, 2005 FOR APPF IV. On the
         Maturity Date, the APPLICABLE [begin strikethru]S[end
               strikethru]Series shall have the obligation, subject to the
       conditions and limitations set forth in this [begin
              strikethru]Article FOURTH[end strikethru] PARAGRAPH (A) OF
           ARTICLE NINTH, to pay to each shareholder of the [begin
             strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series, in redemption of such
                  shareholder's [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the
                 [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series, the greater of (i)
   the net asset value per [begin strikethru]s[end
                  strikethru]Share of such shareholder's [begin strikethru]s[end
    strikethru]Shares of the [begin strikethru]S[end
         strikethru]Series as of the Maturity Date or (ii) the
                 Guarantee Per Share, the calculation of which is described in
            the Corporation's Registration Statement (as referred to
               below), multiplied by the number of [begin strikethru]s[end
    strikethru]Shares of the [begin strikethru]S[end
              strikethru]Series held by such shareholder on the Maturity
                  Date. [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares redeemed prior

               strikethru]s[end strikethru]Share net asset value as of the
                 date of redemption but shall not be entitled to the Guarantee
      Per Share. The obligation of the APPLICABLE [begin

                 preceding sentence shall be payable solely from the assets of

              strikethru]Series and issued by MBIA Insurance Corporation
                  ("MBIA"). The aforesaid insurance policy provides, among other
              things, that if on the Maturity Date the APPLICABLE [begin
              strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series has insufficient assets
               (excluding the insurance policy and the proceeds therefrom)
                  available to pay shareholders amounts upon redemption of their
                [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares in accordance with
            the aforesaid obligation, MBIA will make payments to the
                 [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series under the insurance
       policy in an amount sufficient to permit the [begin
               strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series to fulfill the aforesaid
               obligation. Nothing herein shall entitle any shareholder of
               the APPLICABLE [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series or
                 MBIA to any assets of the Corporation other than those of the
            [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series, or impose any
                  liability on the Corporation or its directors by reason of any
           breach or default by MBIA under the aforesaid insurance
               policy. All capitalized terms not otherwise defined IN THIS
                  CHARTER OF THE CORPORATION shall have the meanings ascribed to
             them in the Registration Statement on Form N-1A (File No.

  Exchange Commission with respect to the [begin

               the [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the [begin

               [begin strikethru]therein[end strikethru] IN THE CHARTER OF
                  THE CORPORATION, the [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares
                 of the [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series, and of each
                [begin strikethru]C[end strikethru]Class thereof, shall have
                  the preferences, rights and terms and conditions of redemption
           set forth in this [begin strikethru]Article FOURTH [end
               strikethru]PARAGRAPH (A) OF ARTICLE TENTH. On the Guarantee

                such [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the [begin
                  strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series, the greater of (i) the net

                such [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the [begin
          strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series as of the Guarantee
                  Maturity Date or (ii) the Guarantee Per Share, the calculation
           of which is described in the Corporation's Registration
                 Statement (as referred to below), multiplied by the number of
           [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Shares of the [begin

                 strikethru]Share net asset value as of the date of redemption
             but shall not be entitled to the Guarantee Per Share. The
               obligation of the [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Series
               described in the second preceding sentence shall be payable
         solely from the assets of the [begin strikethru]S[end
                  strikethru]Series, which include an insurance policy purchased
             and maintained by the Corporation on behalf of the [begin

       strikethru] MBIA Insurance Corporation ("MBIA")[end
               strikethru]. The aforesaid insurance policy provides, among
                other things, that if on the Guarantee Maturity Date the per
               [begin strikethru]s[end strikethru]Share net asset value is
                 less than the Guarantee Per Share, MBIA will make payments to

  the Corporation other than those of the [begin
                  strikethru]S[end strikethru]series, or impose any liability on
               the Corporation or its directors by reason of any breach or

                  capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this CHARTER OF THE

               THEREOF, but no less frequently than once each week, to
                require the Corporation to redeem all or any part of its

                   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation may postpone
                  payment or deposit of the redemption price and may suspend
            the right of the [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]

            (b) The Corporation shall have the right, exercisable at the
                 discretion of the Board of Directors, to redeem Shares of
                    any [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Shareholder for their
                  then current net asset value per Share if at such time the
                  [begin strikethru]S[end strikethru]Shareholder owns Shares
                   having an aggregate net asset value of less than the amount

          Article THIRTEENTH [begin strikethru]Eleventh [end
             strikethru]of the Charter at any time if the Board of
                  Directors, in its sole discretion, determines that failure
                   to so redeem may result in the Corporation OR ANY SERIES OR
                    CLASS THEREOF being classified as a personal holding company
                 as defined in the [begin strikethru]Internal Revenue [end

               thereof at any time during normal business hours of the
                    Corporation unless the Board of Directors of the Corporation
              determines, in its sole discretion, that allowing such
               transfer may result in the Corporation OR ANY SERIES OR
                    CLASS THEREOF being classified as a personal holding company
                 as defined in the [begin strikethru]Internal Revenue [end

                   against any liability to the Corporation or to its security
                   holders to which he would otherwise be subject by reason of

office.                                 

            (d) The Corporation shall indemnify its Officers, Directors,
             employees and agents and any person who serves at the

                  v)   In the absence of a final decision on the merits by a

                       brought, an indemnification payment will not be made,
                        except as provided in paragraph (vi) of this paragraph
                  (d), unless in the absence of such a decision, a
                      reasonable determination based upon a factual review
                     has been made (1) by a majority vote of a quorum of
                       non-party Directors who are not interested persons of
                         the Corporation, or (2) by independent legal counsel in
                      a written opinion that the indemnitee was not liable
                     for an act of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross
              negligence, or reckless disregard of duties.

                   vi)  The Corporation further undertakes that advancement of
                        expenses incurred in the defense of a proceeding (upon

                         determined that indemnification is appropriate) against
                   an Officer, Director or controlling person of the
                        Corporation will not be made absent the fulfillment of

                      the Corporation is insured against losses arising by
                        reason of any lawful advances or (iii) a majority of a
                quorum of disinterested non-party Directors or
                        independent legal counsel in a written opinion makes a
                         factual determination that there is a reason to believe
                     the indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification.

                   vii) NEITHER THE AMENDMENT NOR REPEAL OF THIS PARAGRAPH (D)
                OF ARTICLE FOURTEENTH, NOR THE ADOPTION OF ANY
                    AMENDMENT OF ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THE CHARTER OR

                       PARAGRAPH (D) OF ARTICLE FOURTEENTH SHALL APPLY TO OR
                AFFECT IN ANY RESPECT THE APPLICABILITY OF THE
                         PRECEDING PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACT OR FAILURE
                       TO ACT WHICH OCCURRED PRIOR TO SUCH AMENDMENT, REPEAL
OR ADOPTION.                  

                (e) The Board of Directors shall, subject to the General Laws of
                the State of Maryland, have the power to determine, from

             CLASS THEREOF, [begin strikethru]or any of them, [end
            strikethru]shall be open to the inspection of [begin
 strikethru]S[end strikethru]Shareholders.

            (f) Notwithstanding any provision of law requiring a greater
                 proportion than a majority of the votes of all classes of
                   Shares entitled to be cast to take or authorize any action,
                  the Corporation may take or authorize any such action upon
                    the concurrence of a majority of the aggregate number of the
votes entitled to be cast thereon.      

                (g) The Corporation reserves the right from time to time to make
                   any amendment of its Charter now or hereafter authorized by
                law, including any amendment which alters the rights, as
              expressly set forth in its Charter, of any outstanding
               Shares, except that no action affecting the validity or
               assessability of such Shares shall be taken without the
             unanimous approval of the outstanding Shares affected
thereby.                                

               (h) In addition to the Powers and authority conferred upon them
                  by the Charter of the Corporation or By-Laws, the Board of
                   Directors may exercise all such powers and authority and do

               applicable state law and the Charter and By-Laws of the
Corporation.                            

               (i) The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to determine
                   in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
             and practices what constitutes net profits, earnings,

View Detailed Performance






The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See above “Average Annual Total Returns %” for performance information current to the most recent month-end. Returns for the other share classes will vary due to different charges and expenses. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a purchase at net asset value at the beginning of the period and a sale at net asset value at the end of the period; and assumes reinvestment of dividends, capital gain distributions and return of capital distributions/allocations, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the dividend reinvestment plan. Net asset value equals total Fund assets net of Fund expenses such as operating costs and management fees. Total investment return at net asset value is not annualized for periods less than one year.



Benchmark Disclosures

S&P 500 Index
The Standard and Poor's 500 Index is an unmanaged capitalization-weighted index of 500 stocks designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks representing all major industries. The index does not reflect fees, brokerage commissions, taxes or other expenses of investing. Investors cannot invest directly in an index.




Principal Risks
All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. Investing in funds that are concentrated in a smaller number of holdings poses greater risk than funds with a larger number of holdings because each investment has a greater effect on the Fund's performance. The value of a participation fluctuates with the market value of the underlying portfolio securities of the Trust. The dividend income, if any, from the portfolio securities is subject to fluctuation which in turn will affect the amounts of distributions made to participants. An investor in the Trust has no assurance against loss in a declining market, and redemption at a time when the market value of the participations is less than their cost will result in a loss to the investor.Taxation: For Federal income tax purposes, (1) the Trust will be treated as a fixed investment trust and will not be subject to Federal income tax, (2) each participant will be treated as the owner of his pro rata portion of the common stock of the corporations held by the Trust, (3) each participant will be required to include in his gross income his pro rata portion of the dividends and interest received by the Trust (including the amounts of such dividends and interest that are not distributed to participants but are used to pay the fees and expenses of the Trust), at the time such dividends and interest are received by the Trust, not at the later time such dividends and interests are distributed to participants or reinvested in additional participations, and (4) each individual participant who itemizes deductions may deduct his pro rata portion of the fees and expenses of the Trust only to the extent such amount, together with his other miscellaneous itemized deductions, exceeds 2% of his adjusted gross income. Please see the prospectus for further information.
