Holland has produced more than 100 feature films including Hurricane Streets which was the first film ever to win three Sundance Film Festival awards in 1997 as well as the Cannes Film Festival selection Inside/Out, the Independent Spirit Awards winner Sweet Land and nominee Dear Jesse (also nominated for an Emmy), the Gotham Awards nominee Spring Forward, FLOW: For Love of Water which was short-listed for an Academy Award,[1] and 2017 SXSW winners The Seer (re-titled Look and See: A Portrait of Wendell Berry) and Most Beautiful Island.

He was an editor[5] before he sold cineBLAST! in 2000 at the height of the tech boom.[2] Before that he worked for three years at the French Film Office / Unifrance after a brief stint at October Films.[6]

The company moved with Holland to Louisville in 2006.[8]
Together with his wife, Augusta Brown Holland, Gill Holland developed The Green Building.[9][10] This renovation of a historic building opened in the Fall of 2008 in the area that he dubbed NuLu[10][11][12] (a.k.a. the East Market District), the heart of Louisville's arts district.

His biggest achievement would be The Green Building.[2][9][10][14][15] The building has become a staple of the movement in the NuLu. His goal with this district is to create a locally run area that showcases local restaurants, locally grown food and buildings that use sustainable resources. Holland was quoted by The Lane Report saying "There's a saying that the Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stone," he said. "The coal age is not going to end because we run out of coal. I'm all about incentivizing people to change, (but) not mandating it or telling them (they have) to do it." about the green movement. The Green Building (Louisville, Kentucky) was only step one. Now Holland, who is the poster child for the green movement in Kentucky, has more plans to make Kentucky a green state as well. He was instrumental in helping Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer hire its first Director of Sustainability. He wrote the forward to Sally van Winkle Campbell's "Saving Kentucky: Greening the Bluegrass."

Documents reveal a legal latticework shielding the Brown family’s $6 billion whiskey fortune




By Jim Hopkins
Boulevard Publisher
When Brown-Forman stockholders gathered in July at the whiskey giant’s Georgian Revival headquarters west of downtown, the outcome of a crucial vote — re-electing 12 directors to the governing board — was anything but a surprise.
This has been the founding Brown family’s company for nearly 150 years. Six of the directors were Browns, including board Chairman George Garvin Brown IV — a great-great grandson of the founder — and the rest were unquestionably family loyalists.
Stockholders outside the family knew what Brown-Forman has disclosed for years in an annual statement soliciting their votes: 13 individual Browns and family groups hold 67% of all the voting shares in “a variety of family trusts and entities, with multiple family members often sharing voting control and investment power.”
Much less has been known about the scope of those entities, leaving more than 5,600 other stockholders in the dark about exactly how the Browns divvy up nearly $6 billion in shares among a core group of relatives.
Founder Brown.
But now, documents filed by the Browns with the Securities and Exchange Commission detail how complex their ownership has grown since the pharmaceuticals salesman George Garvin Brown founded the company in 1870. They shed light on how the Browns have deployed extensive trust accounts, business partnerships, and other legal vehicles to pass down Brown-Forman stock through six generations. That’s an exceptional legacy in American business: Just 12% of family-owned companies survive into the third generation, and a slim 3% survive to the fourth and beyond.
The documents also point to a network of boutique consulting firms and other white-shoe professionals advising the city’s wealthiest families on everything from investments to taxes and charitable giving, hiring housekeepers and gardeners — even organizing vacation travel and family gatherings. Paid tens of thousands of dollars a year in fees, the firms are the backbone of a larger, multibillion-dollar economy serving the area’s uber-rich.
Clockwise from top left: Garvin Brown IV, Campbell Brown, Christy Brown, Laura Frazier, Sandra Frazier and Mac Brown.
The documents were filed over the past 18 months by  Continue reading “Documents reveal a legal latticework shielding the Brown family’s $6 billion whiskey fortune” →

In FoodPort’s sudden failure, a rare defeat for Louisville’s blue-chip philanthropists: the Brown family

Boulevard Publisher
For the past two years, developers of the West Louisville FoodPort worked mightily to bring urban farming and as many as 250 good jobs to the heart of a neighborhood yearning for a better future. Mayor Greg Fischer said the project would “change the look and feel of Russell forever.” Their ambitious, $35 million plan was going so well, one of the world’s foremost advocates of organic food paid a headline-grabbing visit last year: Prince Charles, heir to the British throne.
Reily
But yesterday, the entire enterprise collapsed when the non-profit developers, Seed Capital Kentucky, abruptly announced they’d lost a linchpin partner, and without enough time to find a replacement. “We don’t have a way to put it together,” Seed Capital co-founder Stephen Reily said. “We are deeply disappointed.”
Many, many other people were disappointed as well: the mayor, who’d pushed the project as a centerpiece for revitalizing the Russell neighborhood, only to see it steadily scaled back amid community infighting; some 150 residents who helped shepherd the project past months of political hurdles, and the Russell councilwoman, Cheri Bryant Hamilton, “heartbroken” last night over its failure, The Courier-Journal said.
But less publicized was the distress almost certainly felt by a high-profile Louisville family who had invested heavily in its development: the Browns, founders of the spirits giant Brown-Forman. It was an unusual defeat for a family that’s often in the vanguard of high-profile causes ending in resounding success.
Brown
The Browns were there at critical junctures for the FoodPort, including last year’s goodwill tour by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. In a speech at the Cathedral of the Assumption on that overcast Friday in March, the CJ reported at the time, “the prince credited his visit to the persuasive powers of Louisville philanthropist Christina Lee Brown, matriarch of the family that controls Brown-Forman.”
Indeed, in 0ne photo with the newspaper’s online story, the unidentified woman in an orange coat and strands of pearls, beaming in the royal couple’s wake during one of their walkabouts, is Christina, known to many in Louisville as Christy.
Holland
As one of the city’s best-known philanthropists, she and her immediate family have formed the core of the extended Brown family’s support of Seed Capital. Her daughter, Augusta Brown Holland, an urban planner and investor, is one of the non-profit’s six board members. Another daughter, Brooke Brown Barzun, has a more direct line to Buckingham Palace: Her husband, Matthew Barzun, is U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom.
A tale of IRS tax returns
The Browns donate multimillions of dollars annually to charities from coast to coast, although especially in Louisville. But they don’t often seek attention for their contributions.
On the CJ: Camilla, Christy and Charles.
In fact, Seed Capital only hints at the family’s hefty financial support,
on a difficult-to-find page of its website with a barebones alphabetical roster of “funders.” Of the 16 names listed, six are Brown family members or their personal charitable foundations. A seventh is the source of their $6 billion fortune: Brown-Forman, the nearly 150-year-old producer of Jack Daniel’s and other well-known brands. And an eighth, the Community Foundation of Louisville, is home to at least 10 individual Brown donor-advised funds.
Brown family foundation public IRS tax returns fill in details. In 2012-2015, six of the foundations donated a combined  Continue reading “In FoodPort’s sudden failure, a rare defeat for Louisville’s blue-chip philanthropists: the Brown family” →

Brown-Forman discloses director election tally, and support wasn’t uniform across the board




Brown
The director-by-director vote tallies filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission followed last Thursday’s annual meeting, where the Louisville-based spirits giant said only that the full slate of 12 directors had been re-elected.
As is often the case, directors received varying degrees of support. Here’s the tally of “for” votes each one got; names are listed in order of those getting the highest to lowest share of all eligible votes. Board Chairman George Garvin Brown IV won the most: 95.72%.

The Brown family controls the nearly 150-year-old company through their 67% ownership of all voting class A shares.
Updated 8:40 p.m. Also today, Garvin Brown and newly re-elected Director Augusta Brown Holland were among a group of officers and executives who filed updated stock ownership notices with the SEC. The 22 separate Form 4 documents are in the SEC filings section of the company’s investor relations webpage.

Ind. Kindred exec accused of child molestation found dead; layoffs hit Deutsch ad agency that lost Pizza Hut account; GE Firstbuild’s cold-brew coffee maker set for 2017 release




A news summary focused on 10 big employers; updated 7:42 p.m.
KINDRED: The Johnson County Sheriff’s Office says Kindred Greenwood hospital CFO William Brenner was found dead inside his home near Indianapolis yesterday, 10 days after authorities accused him of molesting a 6-year-old boy he was fostering in 2014 and 2015.
Brenner
Police say there was no evidence of a struggle and no weapons were found near the body. Investigators believe he may have had a medical episode and had died several days earlier. His body was found in a hallway and was badly decomposed (WIBC).
Brenner, 49, faced four counts of felony child molesting and one count of felony dissemination of matter harmful to minors, according to the Indianapolis Star. The Greenwood facility is one of Louisville-based Kindred’s 95 transitional care and rehabilitation hospitals. Greenwood is 12 miles south of Indianapolis.
Also today, Kindred said it would release its second-quarter financial results on Aug. 4 after stock markets close. The following day, it will host a teleconference with Wall Street analysts to discuss the report (press release).
In downtown Louisville, construction is picking up at Kindred’s new headquarters expansion at Broadway and Fourth streets after a relatively slow start. The $36 million project financed with substantial public incentives will add 142,000 square feet and around 500 new jobs. Plans also include around 7,000 square feet of restaurant space (Broken Sidewalk).

PIZZA HUT: Advertising agency Deutsch went through a round of layoffs at its Los Angeles office last week directly related to the loss of the Pizza Hut account last spring. A Deutsch spokesperson would say only that less than 2% of the L.A.-based team had been affected. Deutsch won the struggling Yum unit’s account two years ago and went on to create the agency’s debut campaign (which essentially said, “We’re Italian”); video, top. Last December, the pizza chain started shopping the account, eventually choosing the independent Droga5 agency in May — its fifth agency of record in six years. Multiple sources have told Adweek that Pizza Hut is not the world’s most agreeable client. It’s not yet clear when Droga5’s first work for the chain will appear (Adweek).
Prisma.
GE: A cold-brew coffeemaker developed by GE Appliances’ Firstbuild laboratory in Louisville is scheduled to reach the market next summer, after first passing through a crowdfunding round on IndieGoGo. The lab is using unconventional funding for the coffee maker, called Prisma, not so much as a financial requirement as it is an awareness-raising launchpad. “We believe crowdfunding is a great way to validate products with the early adopter community,” Firstbuild Senior Design Engineer Justin Brown told Daily Coffee News. The Prisma can make anywhere from five to 25 ounces of ready-to-drink cold coffee (Daily Coffee News).
AMAZON has reportedly fired one of its delivery men Continue reading “Ind. Kindred exec accused of child molestation found dead; layoffs hit Deutsch ad agency that lost Pizza Hut account; GE Firstbuild’s cold-brew coffee maker set for 2017 release” →

Brown-Forman – Brown Family Continues a Multi-Year Transition Brown-Forman Board

Brown Family Continues a Multi-Year Transition Brown-Forman Board

Louisville, KY, May 21, 2015 – Brown-Forman Corporation announced today that its Board of Directors has elected Augusta Brown Holland and Stuart R. Brown to become directors of the company, effective today.  Both are fifth generation descendants of George Garvin Brown, who founded Brown-Forman in 1870. They join three other fifth generation family directors, Sandra A. Frazier, Martin S. Brown, Jr., and Geo. Garvin Brown IV, the chairman of the board. The Brown family has controlled a majority of the voting stock of the company since its founding.
The election of Augusta Brown Holland and Stuart R. Brown continues an on-going multi-year evolution of Brown family representation on the board.  As part of this process, Dace Brown Stubbs, the last member of the family’s fourth generation to serve on the board, has elected not to stand for re-election at the annual stockholders’ meeting in July, after sixteen years of service as a director. 
“Like so many in her generation, Dace Brown Stubbs has dedicated much of her time and energy to Brown-Forman in order to secure the long-term success and prosperity of the company, its shareholders, and its stakeholders,” said Chairman Garvin Brown. “On behalf of her fellow directors and the Brown family, I would like to offer Dace our heartfelt thanks for her sixteen years of board service, including her commitment to stay on the board for the last decade. During that time, her wisdom, engagement, and stewardship have helped ensure a smooth transition from the fourth to fifth generation.” 
Paul Varga, chief executive officer of Brown-Forman, noted that “Dace thoughtfully encouraged the company to evolve its portfolio and deploy its capital with a very long-term
view.  Her balance and optimism in the board room were key contributors during a period of exceptional progress for Brown-Forman.”
Augusta Brown Holland is a developer and founding partner at Haystack Partners, LLC, known for its nationally acclaimed work on The Green Building in NuLu, the East Market Street District of Louisville, KY.  She earned a master’s degree in urban planning from Columbia University and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Virginia.  She is also the daughter of Owsley Brown II, the company’s chief executive officer from 1993 to 2005 and chairman from 1995 until his retirement in 2007. 
Stuart R. Brown is the managing partner of Typha Partners, LLC of Cambridge, MA, a private equity fund, and the president of Dendrifund, Inc., an environmental sustainability charitable foundation established by Brown-Forman. He holds a bachelor’s degree from the University of Georgia, and an MBA from Vanderbilt University. Previously, he served the company in sales and marketing roles in the 1990s. He is also the son of W.L. Lyons Brown, the company’s chief executive officer from 1975 to 1993, and chairman from 1982 until his retirement in 1995. 
“As co-chairs of the Brown-Forman Brown Family Shareholders Committee, Paul and I have enjoyed working alongside Augusta and Stuart since 2007, when they joined other cousins as founding members of the Family Shareholders Committee.  In that time, they have each helped build on the strong and enduring relationship between long-term shareholders and the company, work which we know they will continue to enjoy on the board,” remarked Garvin Brown. 
For more than 140 years, Brown-Forman Corporation has enriched the experience of life by responsibly building fine quality beverage alcohol brands, including Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Honey, Southern Comfort, Finlandia, Jack Daniel’s & Cola, Canadian Mist, Korbel, Gentleman Jack, el Jimador, Herradura, Sonoma-Cutrer, Chambord, New Mix, Tuaca, and Woodford Reserve. Brown-Forman’s brands are supported by nearly 4,200 employees and sold in approximately 160 countries worldwide. For more information about the company, please visit https://www.brown-forman.com/.
