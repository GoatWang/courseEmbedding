E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, commonly referred to as DuPont, is an American conglomerate that was founded in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill by American chemist and industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont.
In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.
In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization[3] and eighth based on revenue.[4] Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

History[edit]

Establishment: 1802[edit]
DuPont was founded in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. It began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.
Expansion: 1902 to 1912[edit]
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.[5] The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel).[6] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[7]
In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional, inefficient means.[8]
DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on cellulose chemistry, lacquers and other non-explosive products. DuPont Central Research was established at the DuPont Experimental Station, across the Brandywine Creek from the original powder mills.
Automotive investments: 1914[edit]
In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.
Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s[edit]

In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on materials science, hiring Wallace Carothers to work on polymers in 1928. Carothers invented neoprene, a synthetic rubber;[9] the first polyester superpolymer; and, in 1935, nylon. The invention of Teflon followed a few years later. DuPont introduced phenothiazine as an insecticide in 1935.[10]
Second World War: 1941 to 1945[edit]
DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.[11] As the inventor and manufacturer of nylon, DuPont helped produce the raw materials for parachutes, powder bags,[12] and tires.[13]
DuPont also played a major role in the Manhattan Project in 1943, designing, building and operating the Hanford plutonium producing plant in Hanford, Washington. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.
Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970[edit]
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.[citation needed]
DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make flak jackets. With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.[citation needed]
Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999[edit]
In 1981, DuPont acquired Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.[14]
In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with Phillips Petroleum Company, and acquired the Pioneer Hi-Bred agricultural seed company.

DuPont describes itself as a global science company that employs more than 60,000 people worldwide and has a diverse array of product offerings.[1] The company ranks 86th in the Fortune 500 on the strength of nearly $36 billion in revenues, $4.848 billion in profits in 2013.[16] In April 2014, Forbes ranked DuPont 171st on its Global 2000, the listing of the world's top public companies.[17]
DuPont businesses are organized into the following five categories, known as marketing "platforms": Electronic and Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, Coatings and Color Technologies, Safety and Protection, and Agriculture and Nutrition.
The agriculture division, DuPont Pioneer makes and sells hybrid seed and genetically modified seed, some of which goes on to become genetically modified food. Genes engineered into their products include LibertyLink, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite Herbicide/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects; the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.[18] In 2010, DuPont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75 percent. Plenish provides a product with no trans fat, 20 percent less saturated fat than regular soybean oil, and more stabile oil with greater flexibility in food and industrial applications."[19] Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."[20]
In October 2001, the company sold its pharmaceutical business to Bristol Myers Squibb for $7.798 billion.[21]
In 2002, the company sold the Clysar(R)business to Bemis Company for $143 million.[22][23]
In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.
In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry.[24]
DuPont has 150 research and development facilities located in China, Brazil, India, Germany, and Switzerland with an average investment of $2 billion annually in a diverse range of technologies for many markets including agriculture, genetic traits, biofuels, automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and industrial materials. DuPont employs more than 10,000 scientists and engineers around the world.[1]
On January 9, 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Danish company Danisco for US$6.3 billion.[25] On May 16, 2011, DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.[26]
On May 1, 2012, DuPont announced that it had acquired from Bunge full ownership of the Solae joint venture, a soy-based ingredients company. DuPont previously owned 72 percent of the joint venture while Bunge owned the remaining 28 percent.[27]
In February 2013, DuPont Performance Coatings was sold to the Carlyle Group and rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems.[28]
In October 2015, DuPont sold the Neoprene chloroprene rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, a joint venture of Denka and Mitsui.[29]
Chemours[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its Performance Chemicals business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[30] The company filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called The Chemours Company.[31] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[32]
DuPont will focus on production of GMO seeds, materials for solar panels, and alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemours becomes responsible for the cleanup of 171 former DuPont sites, which DuPont says will cost between $295 million and $945 million.[33]
Merger with Dow[edit]
Main article: Dow DuPont merger
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected in the first quarter of 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries.[34][35] Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth.[35] The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene.[35] They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.[36] This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger is now targeted to close in mid-2017.[37]
Locations[edit]

On October 5, 2015, DuPont announced that Ellen Kullman would retire as Chair and CEO on October 16, 2015.[42] Breen was appointed CEO in November 2015 replacing Kullman.[43][44][45]
Environmental record[edit]
In the 1990s, DuPont was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development with then DuPont CEO Chad Holliday as chairman of the WBCSD from 2000 to 2001.[46] The organization has developed guidelines for measuring sustainability cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council[47] and the Environmental Defense Fund,[48] and its Vision 2050 blueprint for slowing and reversing environmental damage has been highlighted by The Guardian.[49]
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine, in conjunction with the Climate Group, ranked DuPont as the best-practice leader in cutting their carbon gas emissions. DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65 percent from the 1990 levels while using 7 percent less energy and producing 30 percent more product.[50][51]
In May 2007 the $2.1 million DuPont Nature Center at Mispillion Harbor Reserve, a wildlife observatory and interpretive center on the Delaware Bay near Milford, Delaware was opened to enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary. The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).[52][53]
In 2010, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ranked DuPont as the fourth largest corporate source of air pollution in the United States.[54] DuPont released a statement that 2012 total releases and transfers were 13% lower than 2011 levels, and 70% lower than 1987 levels.[55] Data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database included in the Political Economy Research Institute studies likewise show a reduction in DuPont’s emissions from 12.4 million lbs of air releases and 22.4 million lbs of toxic incinerator transfers in 2006[56] to 10.94 million lbs and 22.0 million pounds respectively in 2010. Over the same period, the Political Economy Research Institutes Toxic score for DuPont increased from 122,426 to 7,086,303.[57]
One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways.[58] In 2016, Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, where the facility is located, initiated a $1.1 billion lawsuit against the corporation, accusing it of divesting a unprofitable company with out first remediating the property as required by law.[59]
In 2012 DuPont was named to the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 Leadership Index. Inclusion is based on company performance on sustainability metrics, emissions reduction goals, and environmental performance transparency.[60] In 2014 DuPont was the top scoring company in the chemical sector according to CDP, with a score of "A" or "B" in every evaluation area except for supply chain management.[61]
Between 2007 and 2014 there were 34 accidents resulting in toxic releases at DuPont plants across the U.S., with no fewer than 8 fatalities.[62] Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000 kg) of methyl mercaptan.[63] As a result, the company became the largest of the 450 businesses placed into the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "severe violator program" in July 2015. The program was established for companies OSHA says have repeatedly failed to address safety infractions.[45][64]
DuPont was part of Global Climate Coalition, a group that lobbied against taking action on climate change.[65]
Recognition[edit]
DuPont has been awarded the National Medal of Technology four times: first in 1990, for its invention of "high-performance man-made polymers such as nylon, neoprene rubber, "Teflon" fluorocarbon resin, and a wide spectrum of new fibers, films, and engineering plastics"; the second in 2002 "for policy and technology leadership in the phaseout and replacement of chlorofluorocarbons". DuPont scientist George Levitt was honored with the medal in 1993 for the development of sulfonylurea herbicides. In 1996, DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was recognized for the discovery and development of Kevlar.
On the company's 200th anniversary in 2002, it was presented with the Honor Award by the National Building Museum in recognition of DuPont's "products that directly influence the construction and design process in the building industry."[66]
Controversies[edit]
Genetically modified foods[edit]
Main article: Genetically modified food controversies
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont subsidiary, manufactures genetically modified seeds, other tools, and agricultural technologies used to increase crop yield.
Chlorofluorocarbons[edit]
Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.[67] CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.[68]
In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,[69] DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.
In February 1988, United States Senator Max Baucus, along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge. The Los Angeles Times reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."[68] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".[70]
On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.[71] On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production. The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.[72] In 2003, DuPont was awarded the National Medal of Technology, recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.[73]
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8)[edit]
DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia.[74] PFOA-contaminated drinking water led to increased levels of the compound in the bodies of residents who lived in the surrounding area. A court-appointed C8 Science Panel investigated "whether or not there is a probable link between C8 exposure and disease in the community."[75] They eventually concluded that there is a probable link between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.[76] Water contamination in the Netherlands and links to cancer are also being investigated.[77] A PFOA water contamination interactive maps has been published by ewg.org.[78]
DuPont agreed to sharply reduce its output of PFOA,[79] and was one of eight companies to sign on with the USEPA's 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. The agreement called for the reduction of "facility emissions and product content of PFOA and related chemicals on a global basis by 95 percent by 2010 and to work toward eliminating emissions and product content of these chemicals by 2015."[80] DuPont phased out PFOA entirely in 2013.
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, Perfluorooctanoic acid persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.[81] In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.[82] One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10.5 million.[83] This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA "reasonably and responsibly" based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.[84]
Imprelis[edit]
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called Imprelis, for control of certain plants in turf areas. DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.[85][86]
Price fixing[edit]
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products using neoprene, a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.[87]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]




Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship


DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:

Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.[88]

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by AARP Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,[89] and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "Axalta Coating Systems", to The Carlyle Group[28] in a deal worth $4.9 billion.[90]
In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race).[91] In the Busch Series, the company sponsored Ricky Craven's RC Racing team in the early 1990s.[92]

E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, commonly referred to as DuPont, is an American conglomerate that was founded in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill by American chemist and industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont.
In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.
In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization[3] and eighth based on revenue.[4] Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

History[edit]

Working powder mills on Brandywine Creek, about 1905


Establishment: 1802[edit]
DuPont was founded in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. It began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.
Expansion: 1902 to 1912[edit]
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.[5] The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel).[6] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[7]
In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional, inefficient means.[8]
DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on cellulose chemistry, lacquers and other non-explosive products. DuPont Central Research was established at the DuPont Experimental Station, across the Brandywine Creek from the original powder mills.
Automotive investments: 1914[edit]
In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.
Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s[edit]

In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on materials science, hiring Wallace Carothers to work on polymers in 1928. Carothers invented neoprene, a synthetic rubber;[9] the first polyester superpolymer; and, in 1935, nylon. The invention of Teflon followed a few years later. DuPont introduced phenothiazine as an insecticide in 1935.[10]
Second World War: 1941 to 1945[edit]
DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.[11] As the inventor and manufacturer of nylon, DuPont helped produce the raw materials for parachutes, powder bags,[12] and tires.[13]
DuPont also played a major role in the Manhattan Project in 1943, designing, building and operating the Hanford plutonium producing plant in Hanford, Washington. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.
Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970[edit]
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.[citation needed]
DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make flak jackets. With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.[citation needed]
Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999[edit]
In 1981, DuPont acquired Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.[14]
In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with Phillips Petroleum Company, and acquired the Pioneer Hi-Bred agricultural seed company.

DuPont describes itself as a global science company that employs more than 60,000 people worldwide and has a diverse array of product offerings.[1] The company ranks 86th in the Fortune 500 on the strength of nearly $36 billion in revenues, $4.848 billion in profits in 2013.[16] In April 2014, Forbes ranked DuPont 171st on its Global 2000, the listing of the world's top public companies.[17]
DuPont businesses are organized into the following five categories, known as marketing "platforms": Electronic and Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, Coatings and Color Technologies, Safety and Protection, and Agriculture and Nutrition.
The agriculture division, DuPont Pioneer makes and sells hybrid seed and genetically modified seed, some of which goes on to become genetically modified food. Genes engineered into their products include LibertyLink, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite Herbicide/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects; the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.[18] In 2010, DuPont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75 percent. Plenish provides a product with no trans fat, 20 percent less saturated fat than regular soybean oil, and more stabile oil with greater flexibility in food and industrial applications."[19] Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."[20]
In October 2001, the company sold its pharmaceutical business to Bristol Myers Squibb for $7.798 billion.[21]
In 2002, the company sold the Clysar(R)business to Bemis Company for $143 million.[22][23]
In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.
In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry.[24]
DuPont has 150 research and development facilities located in China, Brazil, India, Germany, and Switzerland with an average investment of $2 billion annually in a diverse range of technologies for many markets including agriculture, genetic traits, biofuels, automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and industrial materials. DuPont employs more than 10,000 scientists and engineers around the world.[1]
On January 9, 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Danish company Danisco for US$6.3 billion.[25] On May 16, 2011, DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.[26]
On May 1, 2012, DuPont announced that it had acquired from Bunge full ownership of the Solae joint venture, a soy-based ingredients company. DuPont previously owned 72 percent of the joint venture while Bunge owned the remaining 28 percent.[27]
In February 2013, DuPont Performance Coatings was sold to the Carlyle Group and rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems.[28]
In October 2015, DuPont sold the Neoprene chloroprene rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, a joint venture of Denka and Mitsui.[29]
Chemours[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its Performance Chemicals business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[30] The company filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called The Chemours Company.[31] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[32]
DuPont will focus on production of GMO seeds, materials for solar panels, and alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemours becomes responsible for the cleanup of 171 former DuPont sites, which DuPont says will cost between $295 million and $945 million.[33]
Merger with Dow[edit]
Main article: Dow DuPont merger
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected in the first quarter of 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries.[34][35] Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth.[35] The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene.[35] They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.[36] This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger is now targeted to close in mid-2017.[37]
Locations[edit]




Entrance to Washington Works in Washington, West Virginia formerly owned by DuPont, now owned by Chemours.


The company's corporate headquarters are located in Wilmington, Delaware. The company’s manufacturing, processing, marketing, and research and development facilities, as well as regional purchasing offices and distribution centers are located throughout the world.[38] Major manufacturing sites include the Spruance plant near Richmond, Virginia, (currently the company's largest plant), the Washington Works site in Washington, West Virginia, the Mobile Manufacturing Center (MMC) in Axis, Alabama, the Bayport plant near Houston, Texas, the Mechelen site in Belgium, and the Changshu site in China.[39] Other locations include the Yerkes Plant on the Niagara River at Tonawanda, New York, the Sabine River Works Plant in Orange, Texas, and the Parlin Site in Sayreville, New Jersey. The facilities in Vadodara, Gujarat and Hyderabad, Telangana in India constitute the DuPont Services Center and DuPont Knowledge Center respectively.

On October 5, 2015, DuPont announced that Ellen Kullman would retire as Chair and CEO on October 16, 2015.[42] Breen was appointed CEO in November 2015 replacing Kullman.[43][44][45]
Environmental record[edit]
In the 1990s, DuPont was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development with then DuPont CEO Chad Holliday as chairman of the WBCSD from 2000 to 2001.[46] The organization has developed guidelines for measuring sustainability cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council[47] and the Environmental Defense Fund,[48] and its Vision 2050 blueprint for slowing and reversing environmental damage has been highlighted by The Guardian.[49]
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine, in conjunction with the Climate Group, ranked DuPont as the best-practice leader in cutting their carbon gas emissions. DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65 percent from the 1990 levels while using 7 percent less energy and producing 30 percent more product.[50][51]
In May 2007 the $2.1 million DuPont Nature Center at Mispillion Harbor Reserve, a wildlife observatory and interpretive center on the Delaware Bay near Milford, Delaware was opened to enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary. The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).[52][53]
In 2010, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ranked DuPont as the fourth largest corporate source of air pollution in the United States.[54] DuPont released a statement that 2012 total releases and transfers were 13% lower than 2011 levels, and 70% lower than 1987 levels.[55] Data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database included in the Political Economy Research Institute studies likewise show a reduction in DuPont’s emissions from 12.4 million lbs of air releases and 22.4 million lbs of toxic incinerator transfers in 2006[56] to 10.94 million lbs and 22.0 million pounds respectively in 2010. Over the same period, the Political Economy Research Institutes Toxic score for DuPont increased from 122,426 to 7,086,303.[57]
One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways.[58] In 2016, Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, where the facility is located, initiated a $1.1 billion lawsuit against the corporation, accusing it of divesting a unprofitable company with out first remediating the property as required by law.[59]
In 2012 DuPont was named to the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 Leadership Index. Inclusion is based on company performance on sustainability metrics, emissions reduction goals, and environmental performance transparency.[60] In 2014 DuPont was the top scoring company in the chemical sector according to CDP, with a score of "A" or "B" in every evaluation area except for supply chain management.[61]
Between 2007 and 2014 there were 34 accidents resulting in toxic releases at DuPont plants across the U.S., with no fewer than 8 fatalities.[62] Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000 kg) of methyl mercaptan.[63] As a result, the company became the largest of the 450 businesses placed into the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "severe violator program" in July 2015. The program was established for companies OSHA says have repeatedly failed to address safety infractions.[45][64]
DuPont was part of Global Climate Coalition, a group that lobbied against taking action on climate change.[65]
Recognition[edit]
DuPont has been awarded the National Medal of Technology four times: first in 1990, for its invention of "high-performance man-made polymers such as nylon, neoprene rubber, "Teflon" fluorocarbon resin, and a wide spectrum of new fibers, films, and engineering plastics"; the second in 2002 "for policy and technology leadership in the phaseout and replacement of chlorofluorocarbons". DuPont scientist George Levitt was honored with the medal in 1993 for the development of sulfonylurea herbicides. In 1996, DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was recognized for the discovery and development of Kevlar.
On the company's 200th anniversary in 2002, it was presented with the Honor Award by the National Building Museum in recognition of DuPont's "products that directly influence the construction and design process in the building industry."[66]
Controversies[edit]
Genetically modified foods[edit]
Main article: Genetically modified food controversies
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont subsidiary, manufactures genetically modified seeds, other tools, and agricultural technologies used to increase crop yield.
Chlorofluorocarbons[edit]
Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.[67] CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.[68]
In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,[69] DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.
In February 1988, United States Senator Max Baucus, along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge. The Los Angeles Times reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."[68] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".[70]
On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.[71] On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production. The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.[72] In 2003, DuPont was awarded the National Medal of Technology, recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.[73]
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8)[edit]
DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia.[74] PFOA-contaminated drinking water led to increased levels of the compound in the bodies of residents who lived in the surrounding area. A court-appointed C8 Science Panel investigated "whether or not there is a probable link between C8 exposure and disease in the community."[75] They eventually concluded that there is a probable link between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.[76] Water contamination in the Netherlands and links to cancer are also being investigated.[77] A PFOA water contamination interactive maps has been published by ewg.org.[78]
DuPont agreed to sharply reduce its output of PFOA,[79] and was one of eight companies to sign on with the USEPA's 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. The agreement called for the reduction of "facility emissions and product content of PFOA and related chemicals on a global basis by 95 percent by 2010 and to work toward eliminating emissions and product content of these chemicals by 2015."[80] DuPont phased out PFOA entirely in 2013.
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, Perfluorooctanoic acid persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.[81] In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.[82] One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10.5 million.[83] This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA "reasonably and responsibly" based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.[84]
Imprelis[edit]
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called Imprelis, for control of certain plants in turf areas. DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.[85][86]
Price fixing[edit]
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products using neoprene, a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.[87]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]




Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship


DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:

Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.[88]

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by AARP Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,[89] and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "Axalta Coating Systems", to The Carlyle Group[28] in a deal worth $4.9 billion.[90]
In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race).[91] In the Busch Series, the company sponsored Ricky Craven's RC Racing team in the early 1990s.[92]

E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, commonly referred to as DuPont, is an American conglomerate that was founded in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill by American chemist and industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont.
In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.
In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization[3] and eighth based on revenue.[4] Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

History[edit]

Working powder mills on Brandywine Creek, about 1905


Establishment: 1802[edit]
DuPont was founded in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. It began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.
Expansion: 1902 to 1912[edit]
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.[5] The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel).[6] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[7]
In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional, inefficient means.[8]
DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on cellulose chemistry, lacquers and other non-explosive products. DuPont Central Research was established at the DuPont Experimental Station, across the Brandywine Creek from the original powder mills.
Automotive investments: 1914[edit]
In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.
Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s[edit]

In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on materials science, hiring Wallace Carothers to work on polymers in 1928. Carothers invented neoprene, a synthetic rubber;[9] the first polyester superpolymer; and, in 1935, nylon. The invention of Teflon followed a few years later. DuPont introduced phenothiazine as an insecticide in 1935.[10]
Second World War: 1941 to 1945[edit]
DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.[11] As the inventor and manufacturer of nylon, DuPont helped produce the raw materials for parachutes, powder bags,[12] and tires.[13]
DuPont also played a major role in the Manhattan Project in 1943, designing, building and operating the Hanford plutonium producing plant in Hanford, Washington. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.
Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970[edit]
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.[citation needed]
DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make flak jackets. With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.[citation needed]
Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999[edit]
In 1981, DuPont acquired Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.[14]
In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with Phillips Petroleum Company, and acquired the Pioneer Hi-Bred agricultural seed company.

DuPont describes itself as a global science company that employs more than 60,000 people worldwide and has a diverse array of product offerings.[1] The company ranks 86th in the Fortune 500 on the strength of nearly $36 billion in revenues, $4.848 billion in profits in 2013.[16] In April 2014, Forbes ranked DuPont 171st on its Global 2000, the listing of the world's top public companies.[17]
DuPont businesses are organized into the following five categories, known as marketing "platforms": Electronic and Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, Coatings and Color Technologies, Safety and Protection, and Agriculture and Nutrition.
The agriculture division, DuPont Pioneer makes and sells hybrid seed and genetically modified seed, some of which goes on to become genetically modified food. Genes engineered into their products include LibertyLink, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite Herbicide/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects; the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.[18] In 2010, DuPont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75 percent. Plenish provides a product with no trans fat, 20 percent less saturated fat than regular soybean oil, and more stabile oil with greater flexibility in food and industrial applications."[19] Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."[20]
In October 2001, the company sold its pharmaceutical business to Bristol Myers Squibb for $7.798 billion.[21]
In 2002, the company sold the Clysar(R)business to Bemis Company for $143 million.[22][23]
In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.
In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry.[24]
DuPont has 150 research and development facilities located in China, Brazil, India, Germany, and Switzerland with an average investment of $2 billion annually in a diverse range of technologies for many markets including agriculture, genetic traits, biofuels, automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and industrial materials. DuPont employs more than 10,000 scientists and engineers around the world.[1]
On January 9, 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Danish company Danisco for US$6.3 billion.[25] On May 16, 2011, DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.[26]
On May 1, 2012, DuPont announced that it had acquired from Bunge full ownership of the Solae joint venture, a soy-based ingredients company. DuPont previously owned 72 percent of the joint venture while Bunge owned the remaining 28 percent.[27]
In February 2013, DuPont Performance Coatings was sold to the Carlyle Group and rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems.[28]
In October 2015, DuPont sold the Neoprene chloroprene rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, a joint venture of Denka and Mitsui.[29]
Chemours[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its Performance Chemicals business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[30] The company filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called The Chemours Company.[31] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[32]
DuPont will focus on production of GMO seeds, materials for solar panels, and alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemours becomes responsible for the cleanup of 171 former DuPont sites, which DuPont says will cost between $295 million and $945 million.[33]
Merger with Dow[edit]
Main article: Dow DuPont merger
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected in the first quarter of 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries.[34][35] Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth.[35] The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene.[35] They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.[36] This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger is now targeted to close in mid-2017.[37]
Locations[edit]

On October 5, 2015, DuPont announced that Ellen Kullman would retire as Chair and CEO on October 16, 2015.[42] Breen was appointed CEO in November 2015 replacing Kullman.[43][44][45]
Environmental record[edit]
In the 1990s, DuPont was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development with then DuPont CEO Chad Holliday as chairman of the WBCSD from 2000 to 2001.[46] The organization has developed guidelines for measuring sustainability cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council[47] and the Environmental Defense Fund,[48] and its Vision 2050 blueprint for slowing and reversing environmental damage has been highlighted by The Guardian.[49]
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine, in conjunction with the Climate Group, ranked DuPont as the best-practice leader in cutting their carbon gas emissions. DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65 percent from the 1990 levels while using 7 percent less energy and producing 30 percent more product.[50][51]
In May 2007 the $2.1 million DuPont Nature Center at Mispillion Harbor Reserve, a wildlife observatory and interpretive center on the Delaware Bay near Milford, Delaware was opened to enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary. The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).[52][53]
In 2010, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ranked DuPont as the fourth largest corporate source of air pollution in the United States.[54] DuPont released a statement that 2012 total releases and transfers were 13% lower than 2011 levels, and 70% lower than 1987 levels.[55] Data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database included in the Political Economy Research Institute studies likewise show a reduction in DuPont’s emissions from 12.4 million lbs of air releases and 22.4 million lbs of toxic incinerator transfers in 2006[56] to 10.94 million lbs and 22.0 million pounds respectively in 2010. Over the same period, the Political Economy Research Institutes Toxic score for DuPont increased from 122,426 to 7,086,303.[57]
One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways.[58] In 2016, Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, where the facility is located, initiated a $1.1 billion lawsuit against the corporation, accusing it of divesting a unprofitable company with out first remediating the property as required by law.[59]
In 2012 DuPont was named to the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 Leadership Index. Inclusion is based on company performance on sustainability metrics, emissions reduction goals, and environmental performance transparency.[60] In 2014 DuPont was the top scoring company in the chemical sector according to CDP, with a score of "A" or "B" in every evaluation area except for supply chain management.[61]
Between 2007 and 2014 there were 34 accidents resulting in toxic releases at DuPont plants across the U.S., with no fewer than 8 fatalities.[62] Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000 kg) of methyl mercaptan.[63] As a result, the company became the largest of the 450 businesses placed into the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "severe violator program" in July 2015. The program was established for companies OSHA says have repeatedly failed to address safety infractions.[45][64]
DuPont was part of Global Climate Coalition, a group that lobbied against taking action on climate change.[65]
Recognition[edit]
DuPont has been awarded the National Medal of Technology four times: first in 1990, for its invention of "high-performance man-made polymers such as nylon, neoprene rubber, "Teflon" fluorocarbon resin, and a wide spectrum of new fibers, films, and engineering plastics"; the second in 2002 "for policy and technology leadership in the phaseout and replacement of chlorofluorocarbons". DuPont scientist George Levitt was honored with the medal in 1993 for the development of sulfonylurea herbicides. In 1996, DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was recognized for the discovery and development of Kevlar.
On the company's 200th anniversary in 2002, it was presented with the Honor Award by the National Building Museum in recognition of DuPont's "products that directly influence the construction and design process in the building industry."[66]
Controversies[edit]
Genetically modified foods[edit]
Main article: Genetically modified food controversies
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont subsidiary, manufactures genetically modified seeds, other tools, and agricultural technologies used to increase crop yield.
Chlorofluorocarbons[edit]
Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.[67] CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.[68]
In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,[69] DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.
In February 1988, United States Senator Max Baucus, along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge. The Los Angeles Times reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."[68] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".[70]
On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.[71] On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production. The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.[72] In 2003, DuPont was awarded the National Medal of Technology, recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.[73]
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8)[edit]
DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia.[74] PFOA-contaminated drinking water led to increased levels of the compound in the bodies of residents who lived in the surrounding area. A court-appointed C8 Science Panel investigated "whether or not there is a probable link between C8 exposure and disease in the community."[75] They eventually concluded that there is a probable link between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.[76] Water contamination in the Netherlands and links to cancer are also being investigated.[77] A PFOA water contamination interactive maps has been published by ewg.org.[78]
DuPont agreed to sharply reduce its output of PFOA,[79] and was one of eight companies to sign on with the USEPA's 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. The agreement called for the reduction of "facility emissions and product content of PFOA and related chemicals on a global basis by 95 percent by 2010 and to work toward eliminating emissions and product content of these chemicals by 2015."[80] DuPont phased out PFOA entirely in 2013.
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, Perfluorooctanoic acid persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.[81] In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.[82] One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10.5 million.[83] This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA "reasonably and responsibly" based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.[84]
Imprelis[edit]
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called Imprelis, for control of certain plants in turf areas. DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.[85][86]
Price fixing[edit]
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products using neoprene, a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.[87]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]




Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship


DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:

Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.[88]

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by AARP Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,[89] and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "Axalta Coating Systems", to The Carlyle Group[28] in a deal worth $4.9 billion.[90]
In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race).[91] In the Busch Series, the company sponsored Ricky Craven's RC Racing team in the early 1990s.[92]

E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, commonly referred to as DuPont, is an American conglomerate that was founded in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill by American chemist and industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont.
In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.
In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization[3] and eighth based on revenue.[4] Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

History[edit]

Establishment: 1802[edit]
DuPont was founded in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. It began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.
Expansion: 1902 to 1912[edit]
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.[5] The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel).[6] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[7]
In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional, inefficient means.[8]
DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on cellulose chemistry, lacquers and other non-explosive products. DuPont Central Research was established at the DuPont Experimental Station, across the Brandywine Creek from the original powder mills.
Automotive investments: 1914[edit]
In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.
Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s[edit]

In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on materials science, hiring Wallace Carothers to work on polymers in 1928. Carothers invented neoprene, a synthetic rubber;[9] the first polyester superpolymer; and, in 1935, nylon. The invention of Teflon followed a few years later. DuPont introduced phenothiazine as an insecticide in 1935.[10]
Second World War: 1941 to 1945[edit]
DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.[11] As the inventor and manufacturer of nylon, DuPont helped produce the raw materials for parachutes, powder bags,[12] and tires.[13]
DuPont also played a major role in the Manhattan Project in 1943, designing, building and operating the Hanford plutonium producing plant in Hanford, Washington. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.
Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970[edit]
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.[citation needed]
DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make flak jackets. With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.[citation needed]
Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999[edit]
In 1981, DuPont acquired Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.[14]
In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with Phillips Petroleum Company, and acquired the Pioneer Hi-Bred agricultural seed company.

DuPont describes itself as a global science company that employs more than 60,000 people worldwide and has a diverse array of product offerings.[1] The company ranks 86th in the Fortune 500 on the strength of nearly $36 billion in revenues, $4.848 billion in profits in 2013.[16] In April 2014, Forbes ranked DuPont 171st on its Global 2000, the listing of the world's top public companies.[17]
DuPont businesses are organized into the following five categories, known as marketing "platforms": Electronic and Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, Coatings and Color Technologies, Safety and Protection, and Agriculture and Nutrition.
The agriculture division, DuPont Pioneer makes and sells hybrid seed and genetically modified seed, some of which goes on to become genetically modified food. Genes engineered into their products include LibertyLink, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite Herbicide/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects; the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.[18] In 2010, DuPont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75 percent. Plenish provides a product with no trans fat, 20 percent less saturated fat than regular soybean oil, and more stabile oil with greater flexibility in food and industrial applications."[19] Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."[20]
In October 2001, the company sold its pharmaceutical business to Bristol Myers Squibb for $7.798 billion.[21]
In 2002, the company sold the Clysar(R)business to Bemis Company for $143 million.[22][23]
In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.
In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry.[24]
DuPont has 150 research and development facilities located in China, Brazil, India, Germany, and Switzerland with an average investment of $2 billion annually in a diverse range of technologies for many markets including agriculture, genetic traits, biofuels, automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and industrial materials. DuPont employs more than 10,000 scientists and engineers around the world.[1]
On January 9, 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Danish company Danisco for US$6.3 billion.[25] On May 16, 2011, DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.[26]
On May 1, 2012, DuPont announced that it had acquired from Bunge full ownership of the Solae joint venture, a soy-based ingredients company. DuPont previously owned 72 percent of the joint venture while Bunge owned the remaining 28 percent.[27]
In February 2013, DuPont Performance Coatings was sold to the Carlyle Group and rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems.[28]
In October 2015, DuPont sold the Neoprene chloroprene rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, a joint venture of Denka and Mitsui.[29]
Chemours[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its Performance Chemicals business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[30] The company filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called The Chemours Company.[31] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[32]
DuPont will focus on production of GMO seeds, materials for solar panels, and alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemours becomes responsible for the cleanup of 171 former DuPont sites, which DuPont says will cost between $295 million and $945 million.[33]
Merger with Dow[edit]
Main article: Dow DuPont merger
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected in the first quarter of 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries.[34][35] Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth.[35] The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene.[35] They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.[36] This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger is now targeted to close in mid-2017.[37]
Locations[edit]

On October 5, 2015, DuPont announced that Ellen Kullman would retire as Chair and CEO on October 16, 2015.[42] Breen was appointed CEO in November 2015 replacing Kullman.[43][44][45]
Environmental record[edit]
In the 1990s, DuPont was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development with then DuPont CEO Chad Holliday as chairman of the WBCSD from 2000 to 2001.[46] The organization has developed guidelines for measuring sustainability cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council[47] and the Environmental Defense Fund,[48] and its Vision 2050 blueprint for slowing and reversing environmental damage has been highlighted by The Guardian.[49]
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine, in conjunction with the Climate Group, ranked DuPont as the best-practice leader in cutting their carbon gas emissions. DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65 percent from the 1990 levels while using 7 percent less energy and producing 30 percent more product.[50][51]
In May 2007 the $2.1 million DuPont Nature Center at Mispillion Harbor Reserve, a wildlife observatory and interpretive center on the Delaware Bay near Milford, Delaware was opened to enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary. The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).[52][53]
In 2010, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ranked DuPont as the fourth largest corporate source of air pollution in the United States.[54] DuPont released a statement that 2012 total releases and transfers were 13% lower than 2011 levels, and 70% lower than 1987 levels.[55] Data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database included in the Political Economy Research Institute studies likewise show a reduction in DuPont’s emissions from 12.4 million lbs of air releases and 22.4 million lbs of toxic incinerator transfers in 2006[56] to 10.94 million lbs and 22.0 million pounds respectively in 2010. Over the same period, the Political Economy Research Institutes Toxic score for DuPont increased from 122,426 to 7,086,303.[57]
One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways.[58] In 2016, Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, where the facility is located, initiated a $1.1 billion lawsuit against the corporation, accusing it of divesting a unprofitable company with out first remediating the property as required by law.[59]
In 2012 DuPont was named to the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 Leadership Index. Inclusion is based on company performance on sustainability metrics, emissions reduction goals, and environmental performance transparency.[60] In 2014 DuPont was the top scoring company in the chemical sector according to CDP, with a score of "A" or "B" in every evaluation area except for supply chain management.[61]
Between 2007 and 2014 there were 34 accidents resulting in toxic releases at DuPont plants across the U.S., with no fewer than 8 fatalities.[62] Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000 kg) of methyl mercaptan.[63] As a result, the company became the largest of the 450 businesses placed into the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "severe violator program" in July 2015. The program was established for companies OSHA says have repeatedly failed to address safety infractions.[45][64]
DuPont was part of Global Climate Coalition, a group that lobbied against taking action on climate change.[65]
Recognition[edit]
DuPont has been awarded the National Medal of Technology four times: first in 1990, for its invention of "high-performance man-made polymers such as nylon, neoprene rubber, "Teflon" fluorocarbon resin, and a wide spectrum of new fibers, films, and engineering plastics"; the second in 2002 "for policy and technology leadership in the phaseout and replacement of chlorofluorocarbons". DuPont scientist George Levitt was honored with the medal in 1993 for the development of sulfonylurea herbicides. In 1996, DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was recognized for the discovery and development of Kevlar.
On the company's 200th anniversary in 2002, it was presented with the Honor Award by the National Building Museum in recognition of DuPont's "products that directly influence the construction and design process in the building industry."[66]
Controversies[edit]
Genetically modified foods[edit]
Main article: Genetically modified food controversies
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont subsidiary, manufactures genetically modified seeds, other tools, and agricultural technologies used to increase crop yield.
Chlorofluorocarbons[edit]
Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.[67] CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.[68]
In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,[69] DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.
In February 1988, United States Senator Max Baucus, along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge. The Los Angeles Times reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."[68] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".[70]
On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.[71] On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production. The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.[72] In 2003, DuPont was awarded the National Medal of Technology, recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.[73]
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8)[edit]
DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia.[74] PFOA-contaminated drinking water led to increased levels of the compound in the bodies of residents who lived in the surrounding area. A court-appointed C8 Science Panel investigated "whether or not there is a probable link between C8 exposure and disease in the community."[75] They eventually concluded that there is a probable link between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.[76] Water contamination in the Netherlands and links to cancer are also being investigated.[77] A PFOA water contamination interactive maps has been published by ewg.org.[78]
DuPont agreed to sharply reduce its output of PFOA,[79] and was one of eight companies to sign on with the USEPA's 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. The agreement called for the reduction of "facility emissions and product content of PFOA and related chemicals on a global basis by 95 percent by 2010 and to work toward eliminating emissions and product content of these chemicals by 2015."[80] DuPont phased out PFOA entirely in 2013.
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, Perfluorooctanoic acid persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.[81] In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.[82] One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10.5 million.[83] This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA "reasonably and responsibly" based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.[84]
Imprelis[edit]
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called Imprelis, for control of certain plants in turf areas. DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.[85][86]
Price fixing[edit]
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products using neoprene, a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.[87]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]




Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship


DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:

Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.[88]

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by AARP Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,[89] and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "Axalta Coating Systems", to The Carlyle Group[28] in a deal worth $4.9 billion.[90]
In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race).[91] In the Busch Series, the company sponsored Ricky Craven's RC Racing team in the early 1990s.[92]

E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, commonly referred to as DuPont, is an American conglomerate that was founded in July 1802 as a gunpowder mill by American chemist and industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont.
In the 20th century, DuPont developed many polymers such as Vespel, neoprene, nylon, Corian, Teflon, Mylar, Kapton, Kevlar, Zemdrain, M5 fiber, Nomex, Tyvek, Sorona, Corfam, and Lycra. DuPont developed Freon (chlorofluorocarbons) for the refrigerant industry, and later more environmentally friendly refrigerants. It also developed synthetic pigments and paints including ChromaFlair.
In 2014, DuPont was the world's fourth largest chemical company based on market capitalization[3] and eighth based on revenue.[4] Its stock price is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

History[edit]




Original DuPont powder wagon






Working powder mills on Brandywine Creek, about 1905


Establishment: 1802[edit]
DuPont was founded in 1802 by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, using capital raised in France and gunpowder machinery imported from France. The company was started at the Eleutherian Mills, on the Brandywine Creek, near Wilmington, Delaware, two years after he and his family left France to escape the French Revolution and religious persecutions against Huguenot protestants. It began as a manufacturer of gunpowder, as du Pont noticed that the industry in North America was lagging behind Europe. The company grew quickly, and by the mid-19th century had become the largest supplier of gunpowder to the United States military, supplying half the powder used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Eleutherian Mills site is now a museum and a National Historic Landmark.
Expansion: 1902 to 1912[edit]
DuPont continued to expand, moving into the production of dynamite and smokeless powder. In 1902, DuPont's president, Eugene du Pont, died, and the surviving partners sold the company to three great-grandsons of the original founder. Charles Lee Reese was appointed as director and the company began centralizing their research departments.[5] The company subsequently purchased several smaller chemical companies, and in 1912 these actions gave rise to government scrutiny under the Sherman Antitrust Act. The courts declared that the company's dominance of the explosives business constituted a monopoly and ordered divestment. The court ruling resulted in the creation of the Hercules Powder Company (later Hercules Inc. and now part of Ashland Inc.) and the Atlas Powder Company (purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and now part of AkzoNobel).[6] At the time of divestment, DuPont retained the single base nitrocellulose powders, while Hercules held the double base powders combining nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. DuPont subsequently developed the Improved Military Rifle (IMR) line of smokeless powders.[7]
In 1910, DuPont published a brochure entitled "Farming with Dynamite". The pamphlet was instructional, outlining the benefits to using their dynamite products on stumps and various other obstacles that would be easier to remove with dynamite as opposed to other more conventional, inefficient means.[8]
DuPont also established two of the first industrial laboratories in the United States, where they began the work on cellulose chemistry, lacquers and other non-explosive products. DuPont Central Research was established at the DuPont Experimental Station, across the Brandywine Creek from the original powder mills.
Automotive investments: 1914[edit]
In 1914, Pierre S. du Pont invested in the fledgling automobile industry, buying stock in General Motors (GM). The following year he was invited to sit on GM's board of directors and would eventually be appointed the company's chairman. The DuPont company would assist the struggling automobile company further with a $25 million purchase of GM stock. In 1920, Pierre S. du Pont was elected president of General Motors. Under du Pont's guidance, GM became the number one automobile company in the world. However, in 1957, because of DuPont's influence within GM, further action under the Clayton Antitrust Act forced DuPont to divest its shares of General Motors.
Major breakthroughs: 1920s–1930s[edit]

In the 1920s, DuPont continued its emphasis on materials science, hiring Wallace Carothers to work on polymers in 1928. Carothers invented neoprene, a synthetic rubber;[9] the first polyester superpolymer; and, in 1935, nylon. The invention of Teflon followed a few years later. DuPont introduced phenothiazine as an insecticide in 1935.[10]
Second World War: 1941 to 1945[edit]
DuPont ranked 15th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.[11] As the inventor and manufacturer of nylon, DuPont helped produce the raw materials for parachutes, powder bags,[12] and tires.[13]
DuPont also played a major role in the Manhattan Project in 1943, designing, building and operating the Hanford plutonium producing plant in Hanford, Washington. In 1950 DuPont also agreed to build the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina as part of the effort to create a hydrogen bomb.
Space Age developments: 1950 to 1970[edit]
After the war, DuPont continued its emphasis on new materials, developing Mylar, Dacron, Orlon, and Lycra in the 1950s, and Tyvek, Nomex, Qiana, Corfam, and Corian in the 1960s. DuPont materials were critical to the success of the Apollo Project of the United States space program.[citation needed]
DuPont has been the key company behind the development of modern body armor. In the Second World War DuPont's ballistic nylon was used by Britain's Royal Air Force to make flak jackets. With the development of Kevlar in the 1960s, DuPont began tests to see if it could resist a lead bullet. This research would ultimately lead to the bullet resistant vests that are the mainstay of police and military units in the industrialized world.[citation needed]
Conoco holdings: 1981 to 1999[edit]
In 1981, DuPont acquired Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company that gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont one of the top ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy back all the shares owned by Seagram.[14]
In 1999, DuPont sold all of its shares of Conoco, which merged with Phillips Petroleum Company, and acquired the Pioneer Hi-Bred agricultural seed company.

DuPont describes itself as a global science company that employs more than 60,000 people worldwide and has a diverse array of product offerings.[1] The company ranks 86th in the Fortune 500 on the strength of nearly $36 billion in revenues, $4.848 billion in profits in 2013.[16] In April 2014, Forbes ranked DuPont 171st on its Global 2000, the listing of the world's top public companies.[17]
DuPont businesses are organized into the following five categories, known as marketing "platforms": Electronic and Communication Technologies, Performance Materials, Coatings and Color Technologies, Safety and Protection, and Agriculture and Nutrition.
The agriculture division, DuPont Pioneer makes and sells hybrid seed and genetically modified seed, some of which goes on to become genetically modified food. Genes engineered into their products include LibertyLink, which provides resistance to Bayer's Ignite Herbicide/Liberty herbicides; the Herculex I Insect Protection gene which provides protection against various insects; the Herculex RW insect protection trait which provides protection against other insects; the YieldGard Corn Borer gene, which provides resistance to another set of insects; and the Roundup Ready Corn 2 trait that provides crop resistance against glyphosate herbicides.[18] In 2010, DuPont Pioneer received approval to start marketing Plenish soybeans, which contains "the highest oleic acid content of any commercial soybean product, at more than 75 percent. Plenish provides a product with no trans fat, 20 percent less saturated fat than regular soybean oil, and more stabile oil with greater flexibility in food and industrial applications."[19] Plenish is genetically engineered to "block the formation of enzymes that continue the cascade downstream from oleic acid (that produces saturated fats), resulting in an accumulation of the desirable monounsaturated acid."[20]
In October 2001, the company sold its pharmaceutical business to Bristol Myers Squibb for $7.798 billion.[21]
In 2002, the company sold the Clysar(R)business to Bemis Company for $143 million.[22][23]
In 2004, the company sold its textiles business, which included some of its best-known brands such as Lycra (Spandex), Dacron polyester, Orlon acrylic, Antron nylon and Thermolite, to Koch Industries.
In 2011, DuPont was the largest producer of titanium dioxide in the world, primarily provided as a white pigment used in the paper industry.[24]
DuPont has 150 research and development facilities located in China, Brazil, India, Germany, and Switzerland with an average investment of $2 billion annually in a diverse range of technologies for many markets including agriculture, genetic traits, biofuels, automotive, construction, electronics, chemicals, and industrial materials. DuPont employs more than 10,000 scientists and engineers around the world.[1]
On January 9, 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Danish company Danisco for US$6.3 billion.[25] On May 16, 2011, DuPont announced that its tender offer for Danisco had been successful and that it would proceed to redeem the remaining shares and delist the company.[26]
On May 1, 2012, DuPont announced that it had acquired from Bunge full ownership of the Solae joint venture, a soy-based ingredients company. DuPont previously owned 72 percent of the joint venture while Bunge owned the remaining 28 percent.[27]
In February 2013, DuPont Performance Coatings was sold to the Carlyle Group and rebranded as Axalta Coating Systems.[28]
In October 2015, DuPont sold the Neoprene chloroprene rubber business to Denka Performance Elastomers, a joint venture of Denka and Mitsui.[29]
Chemours[edit]
In October 2013, DuPont announced that it was planning to spin off its Performance Chemicals business into a new publicly traded company in mid-2015.[30] The company filed its initial Form 10 with the SEC in December 2014 and announced that the new company would be called The Chemours Company.[31] The spin-off to DuPont shareholders was completed on July 1, 2015 and Chemours stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on the same date.[32]
DuPont will focus on production of GMO seeds, materials for solar panels, and alternatives to fossil fuels. Chemours becomes responsible for the cleanup of 171 former DuPont sites, which DuPont says will cost between $295 million and $945 million.[33]
Merger with Dow[edit]
Main article: Dow DuPont merger
On December 11, 2015, DuPont announced that it would merge with the Dow Chemical Company, in an all-stock deal. The combined company, which will be known as DowDuPont, will have an estimated value of $130 billion, be equally held by the shareholders of both companies, and maintain their headquarters in Delaware and Michigan respectively. Within two years of the merger's closure, expected in the first quarter of 2017 and subject to regulatory approval, DowDuPont will be split into three separate public companies, focusing on the agricultural chemicals, materials science, and specialty product industries.[34][35] Commentators have questioned the economic viability of this plan because, of the three companies, only the specialty products industry has prospects for high growth.[35] The outlook on the profitability of the other two proposed companies has been questioned due to reduced crop prices and lower margins on plastics such as polyethylene.[35] They have also noted that the deal is likely to face antitrust scrutiny in several countries.[36] This eventually became the case, with two delays taking place due to regulatory approvals. The merger is now targeted to close in mid-2017.[37]
Locations[edit]

The company's corporate headquarters are located in Wilmington, Delaware. The company’s manufacturing, processing, marketing, and research and development facilities, as well as regional purchasing offices and distribution centers are located throughout the world.[38] Major manufacturing sites include the Spruance plant near Richmond, Virginia, (currently the company's largest plant), the Washington Works site in Washington, West Virginia, the Mobile Manufacturing Center (MMC) in Axis, Alabama, the Bayport plant near Houston, Texas, the Mechelen site in Belgium, and the Changshu site in China.[39] Other locations include the Yerkes Plant on the Niagara River at Tonawanda, New York, the Sabine River Works Plant in Orange, Texas, and the Parlin Site in Sayreville, New Jersey. The facilities in Vadodara, Gujarat and Hyderabad, Telangana in India constitute the DuPont Services Center and DuPont Knowledge Center respectively.

On October 5, 2015, DuPont announced that Ellen Kullman would retire as Chair and CEO on October 16, 2015.[42] Breen was appointed CEO in November 2015 replacing Kullman.[43][44][45]
Environmental record[edit]
In the 1990s, DuPont was a founding member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development with then DuPont CEO Chad Holliday as chairman of the WBCSD from 2000 to 2001.[46] The organization has developed guidelines for measuring sustainability cited by the Natural Resources Defense Council[47] and the Environmental Defense Fund,[48] and its Vision 2050 blueprint for slowing and reversing environmental damage has been highlighted by The Guardian.[49]
In 2005, BusinessWeek magazine, in conjunction with the Climate Group, ranked DuPont as the best-practice leader in cutting their carbon gas emissions. DuPont reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65 percent from the 1990 levels while using 7 percent less energy and producing 30 percent more product.[50][51]
In May 2007 the $2.1 million DuPont Nature Center at Mispillion Harbor Reserve, a wildlife observatory and interpretive center on the Delaware Bay near Milford, Delaware was opened to enhance the beauty and integrity of the Delaware Estuary. The facility will be state-owned and operated by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).[52][53]
In 2010, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute of the University of Massachusetts Amherst ranked DuPont as the fourth largest corporate source of air pollution in the United States.[54] DuPont released a statement that 2012 total releases and transfers were 13% lower than 2011 levels, and 70% lower than 1987 levels.[55] Data from the EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory database included in the Political Economy Research Institute studies likewise show a reduction in DuPont’s emissions from 12.4 million lbs of air releases and 22.4 million lbs of toxic incinerator transfers in 2006[56] to 10.94 million lbs and 22.0 million pounds respectively in 2010. Over the same period, the Political Economy Research Institutes Toxic score for DuPont increased from 122,426 to 7,086,303.[57]
One of DuPont's facilities was listed No. 4 on the Mother Jones Top 20 polluters of 2010, legally discharging over 5,000,000 pounds (2,300,000 kg) of toxic chemicals into New Jersey/Delaware waterways.[58] In 2016, Carneys Point Township, New Jersey, where the facility is located, initiated a $1.1 billion lawsuit against the corporation, accusing it of divesting a unprofitable company with out first remediating the property as required by law.[59]
In 2012 DuPont was named to the Carbon Disclosure Project Global 500 Leadership Index. Inclusion is based on company performance on sustainability metrics, emissions reduction goals, and environmental performance transparency.[60] In 2014 DuPont was the top scoring company in the chemical sector according to CDP, with a score of "A" or "B" in every evaluation area except for supply chain management.[61]
Between 2007 and 2014 there were 34 accidents resulting in toxic releases at DuPont plants across the U.S., with no fewer than 8 fatalities.[62] Four employees died of suffocation in a Houston, Texas accident involving leakage of nearly 24,000 pounds (11,000 kg) of methyl mercaptan.[63] As a result, the company became the largest of the 450 businesses placed into the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's "severe violator program" in July 2015. The program was established for companies OSHA says have repeatedly failed to address safety infractions.[45][64]
DuPont was part of Global Climate Coalition, a group that lobbied against taking action on climate change.[65]
Recognition[edit]
DuPont has been awarded the National Medal of Technology four times: first in 1990, for its invention of "high-performance man-made polymers such as nylon, neoprene rubber, "Teflon" fluorocarbon resin, and a wide spectrum of new fibers, films, and engineering plastics"; the second in 2002 "for policy and technology leadership in the phaseout and replacement of chlorofluorocarbons". DuPont scientist George Levitt was honored with the medal in 1993 for the development of sulfonylurea herbicides. In 1996, DuPont scientist Stephanie Kwolek was recognized for the discovery and development of Kevlar.
On the company's 200th anniversary in 2002, it was presented with the Honor Award by the National Building Museum in recognition of DuPont's "products that directly influence the construction and design process in the building industry."[66]
Controversies[edit]
Genetically modified foods[edit]
Main article: Genetically modified food controversies
Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont subsidiary, manufactures genetically modified seeds, other tools, and agricultural technologies used to increase crop yield.
Chlorofluorocarbons[edit]
Dupont, along with Frigidaire and General Motors, was a part of a collaborative effort to find a replacement for toxic refrigerants in the 1920s, resulting in the invention of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by Thomas Midgley in 1928.[67] CFCs are ozone-depleting chemicals that were used primarily in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. DuPont was the largest CFC producer in the world with a 25 percent market share in the 1980s, totaling $600 million in annual sales.[68]
In 1974, responding to public concern about the safety of CFCs,[69] DuPont promised to stop production of CFCs should they be proven to be harmful to the ozone layer.
In February 1988, United States Senator Max Baucus, along with two other Senators, wrote to DuPont reminding the company of its pledge. The Los Angeles Times reported that the letter was "generally regarded as an embarrassment for DuPont, which prides itself on its reputation as an environmentally conscious company."[68] The company responded with a strongly worded letter that the available evidence did not support a need to dramatically reduce CFC production and calling the proposal "unwarranted and counterproductive".[70]
On March 14 of the same year, scientists from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency announced the results of a study demonstrating a 2.3% decline in mid-latitude ozone levels between 1969 and 1986, along with evidence tying the decline to CFCs in the upper atmosphere.[71] On March 24, DuPont reversed its position, calling the NASA results "important new information" and announcing that it would phase out CFC production. The company further called for worldwide controls on CFC production and for additional countries to ratify the Montreal Protocol. DuPont's change of policy was widely praised by environmentalists.[72] In 2003, DuPont was awarded the National Medal of Technology, recognizing the company as the leader in developing CFC replacements.[73]
Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; C8)[edit]
DuPont has faced fines from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and litigation over releases of the Teflon-processing aid perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFOA, also known as C8) from their works in Washington, West Virginia.[74] PFOA-contaminated drinking water led to increased levels of the compound in the bodies of residents who lived in the surrounding area. A court-appointed C8 Science Panel investigated "whether or not there is a probable link between C8 exposure and disease in the community."[75] They eventually concluded that there is a probable link between PFOA and kidney cancer, testicular cancer, thyroid disease, high cholesterol, pre-eclampsia and ulcerative colitis.[76] Water contamination in the Netherlands and links to cancer are also being investigated.[77] A PFOA water contamination interactive maps has been published by ewg.org.[78]
DuPont agreed to sharply reduce its output of PFOA,[79] and was one of eight companies to sign on with the USEPA's 2010/2015 PFOA Stewardship Program. The agreement called for the reduction of "facility emissions and product content of PFOA and related chemicals on a global basis by 95 percent by 2010 and to work toward eliminating emissions and product content of these chemicals by 2015."[80] DuPont phased out PFOA entirely in 2013.
Unlike other persistent organic pollutants, Perfluorooctanoic acid persists indefinitely and is completely resistant to bio-degradation, remaining toxic. The only way to reduce levels in the body is by physical elimination rather than degradation.[81] In 2014, the International Agency for Research on Cancer designated PFOA as "possibly carcinogenic" in humans.[82] One Ohio resident was awarded $1.6 million when a jury in 2015 found that her kidney cancer was caused by PFOA in drinking water. In December 2016 $2 million was awarded when a jury found it caused the plaintiff’s testicular cancer and awarded punitive damages in the amount of $10.5 million.[83] This was the third case where a jury found DuPont liable for injuries resulting from exposure to PFOA in drinking water sources. There were 3,500 similar cases awaiting trial c. 2015. According to the co-lead counselor, internal documents revealed during trial showed DuPont had known of a link between PFOA and cancers since 1997. DuPont maintains it has always handled PFOA "reasonably and responsibly" based on the information they, and industry regulators, had available during its use. However, the jury concluded that DuPont did not act to prevent harm or inform the public, despite the information available.[84]
Imprelis[edit]
In October 2010 DuPont began marketing a herbicide called Imprelis, for control of certain plants in turf areas. DuPont voluntarily pulled Imprelis from the market in August 2011 before the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a mandatory stop-sale order on Imprelis after being alerted of numerous reports from golf courses to nurseries that the product was suspected of injuring and, in some cases, killing trees. Norway spruce, white pines and honey locust proved to be among the species of trees that were susceptible.[85][86]
Price fixing[edit]
In 2005, the company plead guilty to fixing prices of chemicals and products using neoprene, a synthetic rubber, resulting in an $84 million fine.[87]
NASCAR sponsorship[edit]




Jeff Gordon's car with the DuPont Cromax Pro sponsorship


DuPont is widely known for its sponsorship of former four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion Jeff Gordon and his Hendrick Motorsports No. 24 Chevrolet SS. DuPont sponsored him since he began in Sprint Cup (then Winston Cup) in 1992. DuPont said this about their sponsorship:

Our sponsorship of Jeff Gordon helps keep DuPont brands and products in the public eye. Branding is a key component of the DuPont knowledge intensity strategy for achieving sustainable growth.[88]

The partnership lasted 18 seasons before DuPont was replaced by AARP Drive to End Hunger as the No. 24 team's primary sponsor. DuPont continued as associate sponsor with a 12-race deal,[89] and the deal was extended to 14 races after DuPont sold its performance coatings business, now known as "Axalta Coating Systems", to The Carlyle Group[28] in a deal worth $4.9 billion.[90]
In addition to Gordon, DuPont sponsored Scott Lagasse in the SuperTruck Series presented by Craftsman during the 1995 season (including a one-off ride for Terry Labonte in the Skoal Bandit Copper World Classic, the inaugural Truck race).[91] In the Busch Series, the company sponsored Ricky Craven's RC Racing team in the early 1990s.[92]

Eleuthère Irénée du Pont
In 1802 E. I. du Pont broke ground on the banks of the Brandywine River and founded the DuPont Company, one of today's leading science and engineering enterprises.












 









Home / Learn / Historical Biographies
Eleuthère Irénée du Pont (1771–1834) was the son of Pierre Samuel du Pont, a French economist, government official, and publicist. When the du Pont family fled to the United States in 1799, Eleuthère Irénée found opportunity in America’s gunpowder industry.

Apprentice to Lavoisier
Pierre Du Pont was among those attempting moderate reforms to inequitable and inefficient institutions in the last years of the Old Regime and the early days of the French Revolution. He became friends with Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier because of their similar political agendas, and together they reorganized the Royal Gunpowder and Saltpeter Administration. Lavoisier, one of the agency’s four directors, soon hired Pierre’s younger son, Eleuthère Irénée, to work in the Essonne gunpowder factory, where he learned how to manufacture gunpowder.
Political Exile
During the French Revolution the du Ponts found themselves under attack, not least because they had personally protected the king and queen from a mob besieging the Tuileries Palace in Paris in 1792. Only changes in administration saved Pierre from the guillotine. In 1799 the entire family left for the United States, where they hoped to found a model community of French exiles—which never came to pass.
American Gunpowder
Eleuthère Irénée soon recognized a business opportunity in the poor quality of the gunpowder generally available in the United States, and in 1802 he set up a powder works on the banks of the Brandywine River near Wilmington, Delaware. Start-up was difficult, and despite significant growth during the War of 1812, for the 32 years of his leadership he carried substantial debt, including loans to pension the widows and orphans of 40 workers killed in a terrible explosion at the powder works in 1818. He nonetheless created a major American business enterprise, one that employed 140 men by 1827 and was producing over a million pounds of gunpowder per year by 1834, the year of his death. Du Pont's sons, Alfred and Henry, carried on E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company after his death.

Dupont - Facing the Corporate Roots of American Fascism


The du Pont Company
By Richard Sanders, Editor, Press for Conversion!
In the 1930s, the du Pont and Morgan
family empires dominated the American corporate elite and their
representatives were central figures in organizing and funding
the American
Liberty League. The du Pont family was so complicit in this
fascist organization that James Farley, FDR's postmaster general
and one of his closest advisors, said the American Liberty League
"ought to be called the American Cellophane League"
because "first it's a Du Pont product and second, you can
see right through it'" (Donald R. McCoy, Coming of Age).
Gerard Colby, in his book DuPont Dynasty, outlines the
family's pivotal role in creating and funding the League. (Click
here for an excerpt.) The Dickstein-McCormack
Committee learned that weapons and equipment for the fascist
plotters Croix
de feu-like superarmy could be obtained from the Remington
Arms Co., on credit through the Du Ponts. Du Pont had acquired
control of the arms company in 1932.
 The
du Pont Co., formed in 1802 by Elèuthere Irénée
du Pont de Nemours, dominated U.S. gunpowder sales for more than
a century. Elèuthere I. du Ponts father, Pierre Samuel,
a French economist, politician and publisher had helped negotiate
the Paris Treaty to end Americas revolution. His rightwing
views made French radicals very suspicious and they sentenced
him to the guillotine. Somehow, he and his son, Elèuthere,
were released and escaped to America, where they arrived January
1, 1800, with a vast fortune.
To challenge Englands domination of the global gunpowder
trade, Napoleon helped E.I. du Pont establish an American gunpowder
business in 1802. Pierre returned to France and negotiated the
French sale of about a million square miles of land to America
(Louisiana Purchase, 1803). Meanwhile, his son made his first
gunpowder sales to a close family friend, President Thomas Jefferson.
Du Pont produced only gunpowder. They were the main supplier
of this product during many wars, including:

* War of 1812 (supplying the U.S. against Britain/Canada)
* South American wars (supplying both Spain and Bolivars
  republics)
* Mexican-American War, 1846 (supplying the U.S.)
* Indian Wars, 1827-1896 (supplying Manifest Destinys
  genocidal westward expansion)
* Crimean War, 1854 (supplying both England and Russia)
* U.S. Civil war, 1861-1865 (supplying the Northern states)
* Spanish-American War, 1898 (supplying the U.S.)
* WWI, 1914-1918 (supplied all U.S. orders; 40% of the Allies
  needs)
In 1897, when they agreed with European competitors to divide
up the world, du Pont got exclusive control of gunpowder sales
in the Americas. By 1905, du Pont had assets of 60 million and
controlled all U.S. government orders. Du Pont bought out 100
of its American competitors and closed most of them down (1903-1907).
In 1907, U.S. anti-Trust laws created two competitors for du Pont
and in 1912 the government ordered du Pont to divest from some
explosives production. Du Pont then diversified into newspaper
publishing, chemicals, paints, varnishes, cellophane and rayon.
WWI was particularly profitable. Du Pont, the worlds largest
producer of dynamite and smokeless gunpowder, made unheard-of
net profits of $250 million.
Between the wars, du Pont was the worlds top manufacturer
of explosives, the worlds leading chemical company and the
top producer of cars and synthetic rubber, another strategic war
material. By the 1930s, it owned Mexican and Chilean explosive
companies and a Canadian chemical company. Although still the
top U.S. gunpowder supplier, this product represented only 2%
of its total production.
Du Ponts General Motors Co. funded a vigilante/terrorist
organization to stop unionization in its Midwestern factories.
Called the Black Legion, its members wore black robes
decorated with a white skull and crossbones. Concealed behind
their slitted hoods, this KKK-like network of white-supremacist
thugs threw bombs into union halls, set fire to labor activists
homes, tortured union organizers and killed at least 50 in Detroit
alone. Many of their victims were Blacks lured North by tales
of good auto-plant jobs. One of their victims, Rev. Earl Little,
was murdered in 1931. His son, later called Malcolm X, was then
six. An earlier memory, his first, was a night-time raid in 1929
when the Legion burnt down their house. Gerard Colby had this
to say about the Black Legion in his book Dupont Dynasty (1984):

"But corporate executives did not give up the tactic
  of vigilante groups, and on June 1, 1936, Cowdrick wrote Harry
  Anderson, G.M's labor relations director, to ask his opinion
  of the Sentinels
  of the Republic. Anderson was apparently unaware of Irénée
  du Pont's support of this organization, but offered his own home-brew
  alternative. "With reference to your letter of June 1 regarding
  the Sentinels of the Republic," he replied a few days later,
  "I have never heard of the organization. Maybe you could
  use a little Black Legion down in your country. It might help."
The "Black Legion" Anderson referred to was indeed
  a great help to General Motors in its struggle to prevent auto
  workers from unionizing. With members wearing black robes and
  slitted hoods adorned with white skull and crossbones, the Black
  Legion was the terror of Michigan and Ohio auto flelds, riding
  like Klansmen through the night in car caravans, bombing union
  halls, burning down homes of labor militants, and flogging and
  murdering union organizers. The organization was divided into
  arson squads, bombing squads, execution squads, and anti-communist
  squads, and membership discipline on pain of torture or death
  was strictly enforced. Legion cells filled G.M. factories, terrorizing
  workers and recruiting Ku Klux Klansmen.
Since 1933 the Black Legion's power had permeated police departments."
The Legion, claiming 200,000 members in Michigan, was divided
into distinct squads, each focused on a different aspect of their
work for du Pont: arson, bombing, execution and anti-communism.
The Legions cells within GM factories intimidated workers,
targeted Jews and recruited for the KKK. They worked together
to stop Reds and unions that demanded their labour rights.
Thanks to a Senate Munitions Investigating Committee (1934-1936)
that examined criminal, warprofit-eering practices of arms companies
during WWI, the public learned that du Pont had led munitions
companies in sabotaging a League of Nations disarmament
conference in Geneva. The committees chair, Gerald Nye,
said that once the munitions people of the world had made
the treaty a satisfactory one to themselves,...Colonel Simons
[of Du Pont] is reporting that even the State Department realized,
in effect, who controlled the Nation.
The du Ponts fought back against widespread public condemnation
that rightly labeled them merchants of death. They
claimed that communists were behind the Senate hearings, and blamed
the Committee for undermining U.S. military power. In response,
Chairman Nye, a Republican from North Dakota, pointing out that
du Pont had made six times as many millions of dollars during
WWI than during the preceding four years so naturally Mr.
du Pont sees red when he sees these profits attacked by international
peace. 
The du Pont Co., and particularly
GM, was a major contributor to Nazi military efforts to wipe communism
off the map of Europe. In 1929, GM bought Adam Opel, Germanys
largest car manufacturer. In 1974, a Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust
and Monopoly heard evidence from researcher Bradford Snell proving
that that in 1935, GM opened an Opel factory to supply the Nazis
with Blitz military trucks. In appreciation, for this
help, Adolf Hitler awarded GMs chief executive for overseas
operations, James Mooney, with the Order of the German Eagle (first
class). Besides military trucks, Germanys GM workers also
producing armored cars, tanks and bomber engines.
Du Ponts GM and Rockefellers
Standard Oil of New Jersey collaborated with I.G. Farben, the
Nazi chemical cartel, to form Ethyl GmbH. This subsidiary, now
called Ethyl Inc., built German factories to give the Nazis leaded
gas fuel (synthetic tetraethyl fuel) for their military vehicles
(1936-1939). Snell quotes from German records captured during
the war:

"The fact that since the beginning of the war we could
  produce lead-tetraethyl is entirely due to the circumstances
  that, shortly before, the Americans [Du Pont, GM and Standard
  Oil] had presented us with the production plants complete with
  experimental knowledge. Without lead-tetraethyl the present method
  of warfare would be unthinkable."
Since WWII, du Pont has continued to be an instrument of U.S.
government weapons production. Besides supplying plastics, rubber
and textiles to military contractors, it invented various new
forms of explosives and rocket propellants, manufactured numerous
chemical weapons and was instrumental in building the worlds
first plutonium production plant for the atomic bomb. It pumped
out Agent Orange and Napalm, thus destroying millions of lives,
livelihoods and whole ecosystems in Southeast Asia.
With 2,000 brand names, 100,000 employees and annual sales
of $25 billion in 1998, du Pont is one of the worlds biggest
corporations. Its 1939 slogan, Better Things for Better
LivingThrough Chemistry, belies a destructive legacy
that will last thousands of generations. One of the globes
worst polluters, it pioneered the creation, marketing and coverup
of almost every dangerous chemical toxin ever known. It now faces
countless lawsuits for the adverse health and environmental effects
of its products, the unsafe working conditions in its factories
and the foolhardy, disposal practices it flaunts as final solutions
for its waste products. Here is a small sampling of du Ponts
gifts to the planet:

* Sulphur dioxide and lead paint 
  * CFCs: 25% of the worlds supply and almost 50% of the
  U.S. market. 
  * Herbicides and pesticides: brain damage, hormone system disruption.

  * Formaldehyde: cancer and respiratory illnesses. 
  * Dioxins: Leading the way to create these carcinogens, du Pont
  then suppressed data on their deadly effects. 
  * Highly-processed, unnutritious products marketed as healthy
  food. 
  * Genetically modified foods and Terminator/Killer
  seeds threaten food security for 1.4 billion people who
  depend on farm-saved seeds. 
  * Patenting plant genes and stealing the Third Worlds genetic
  resources.
  * Using U.S. prison labour and factories in many oppressive regimes.

  * Its oil subsidiary, Conoco, provided petrochemical raw materials
  and caused environmental devastation.
  * Du Pont is one of the worlds biggest producers of green
  house gases. 
  * Sold for 33 years, the fungicide Benlate destroyed crops, shrimp
  farms and caused birth defects. 
  * Since the 1920s, du Pont produced leaded gas which is responsible
  for 80-90% of the worlds environmental lead contamination.
  Besides fueling Nazi war machines that rolled and flew across
  Europe killing tens of millions, this products legacy includes
  retarding childrens mental health and causing hypertension
  in adults. Du Ponts helped stop the U.S. ban until 1996,
  and then increased its overseas sales.

Irénée
du Pont (1876-1963)
By Charles Higham
Irénée, the most imposing and powerful member
of the du Pont clan, was obsessed with Hitlers principles.
He keenly followed the future Fuhrers career in the 1920s.
On Sept. 7, 1926, in a speech to the American Chemical Society,
he advocated a race of supermen, to be achieved by injecting special
drugs into them in boyhood to make their characters to order.
He insisted his men reach physical standards equivalent to that
of a Marine and have blood as pure as that in the veins of the
Vikings. Despite the fact that he had Jewish blood in his own
veins, his anti-Semitism matched that of Hitler.
In outright defiance of Roosevelts desire to improve
working conditions for the average man, GM and the Du Ponts instituted
the speedup systems. These forced men to work at terrifying speeds
on the assembly lines. Many died of the heat and pressure, increased
by fear of losing their jobs. Irénée paid almost
$1 million from his own pocket for armed and gas-equipped storm
troops modeled on the Gestapo to sweep through the plants and
beat up anyone who proved rebellious. He hired the Pinkerton Agency
to send its swarms of detectives through the whole [du Pont] chemicals,
munitions and auto empire to spy on left-wingers or other malcontents.

Thomas Jefferson PapersEleuthère I. du Pont de Nemours to Thomas Jefferson, 1 March 1811

		 From Eleuthère I. du Pont de Nemours

Eleutherian Mills March 1st 1811.Sir
  you have probably Seen in some of the federal papers an article pretended to be the extract of one of my father’s speech in the council of Elders; I will loose no time in contradicting this infamous, wicked and Slanderous publication, but in the mean time I think I owe to the frienship with which you have always honored my father to cancel your doubts, if you could have any about it, in sending you an extract of the said Speech as published in the Journal l’historien. I will have a translation made by a Sworn interpreter and will send it to Baltimore for the perusal of those who may wish to convince themselves of the wickedness of the autor of the publication.
with great respect I remain Sir Your most obedt Servt
 E. I. duPont de Nemours.



RC (DLC); at head of text: “Thomas Jefferson Esqre”; endorsed by TJ as received 6 Mar. 1811 and so recorded in SJL. Enclosure not found.


 Eleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours (1771–1834), gunpowder manufacturer, was born in Paris. He apprenticed at the Régie des Poudres et Salpêtres, 1787, before taking a position at the national powder works at Essones. In 1791 du Pont helped his father, Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours, run a printing house in Paris. The press was ransacked in 1797, and two years later the family sold it and moved to New York. Soon du Pont became convinced that he could turn a profit manufacturing gunpowder. After a trip to France and Spain to acquire equipment and investors, he established a factory near Wilmington, Delaware. TJ corresponded sporadically with du Pont beginning in 1803, and the following year he ordered his powder on behalf of the American government. By the War of 1812 du Pont had become the government’s principal supplier. He also diversified by investing in a woolen mill, a natural outgrowth of his pioneering efforts to breed merino sheep in America. Later du Pont served as a director of the Second Bank of the United States, 1823–25 and 1827–29, and became active in the American Colonization Society (ANB description begins John A. Garraty and Mark C. Carnes, eds., American National Biography, 1999, 24 vols. description ends ; DAB description begins Allen Johnson and Dumas Malone, eds., Dictionary of American Biography, 1928–36, 20 vols. description ends ; DBF description begins Dictionnaire de biographie française, 1933– , 19 vols. description ends ; Bessie G. Du Pont, Life of Eleuthère Irénée du Pont from Contemporary Correspondence, 12 vols. [1923–27]; du Pont to TJ, 20 July 1803 [DeGH: E. I. du Pont de Nemours Papers, Longwood Manuscripts]; TJ to du Pont, 23 Nov. 1804 [DLC]).
   On 1 Mar. 1811 the New-York Evening Post copied an article from the Baltimore Federal Republican that extracted a speech allegedly given by Pierre Samuel Du Pont de Nemours to the French Conseil d’Anciens “more than a dozen years ago.” In it he reputedly argued against implementing tobacco taxes, noting that Americans “are divided into French and British. The French is rising, the British declining. Let us then not corrupt the favourable progress of things by a paltry tax on tobacco—they are avaricious and foolish and will be vexed at it. Wait til the election is done, and then you may do as you please, for we shall have a president chosen from among our partisans—we shall have Mr. Jefferson and then the [council] of America will be ours.”

DuPont Company, in full E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company,  American corporation engaged primarily in biotechnology and the manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The company was founded by Éleuthère Irénée du Pont (1771–1834) in Delaware in 1802 to produce black powder and later other explosives, which remained the company’s main products until the 20th century, when it began to make many other chemicals as well. DuPont now makes a broad array of industrial chemicals, synthetic fibres, petroleum-based fuels and lubricants, pharmaceuticals, building materials, sterile and specialty packaging materials, cosmetics ingredients, and agricultural chemicals. It has plants, subsidiaries, and affiliates worldwide. Its headquarters are in Wilmington, Del.As a young French émigré, du Pont discovered that a good prospect for business in America would be the milling of gunpowder. Returning to Paris, he found investors, and on April 21, 1801, the articles of partnership were signed for E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company. On July 19, 1802, he settled along the Brandywine Creek near Wilmington, Del., and hired workmen to build his powder mills. The first black powder was marketed two years later. Sales rose yearly, especially during the War of 1812, and by the time of his death his mills were a major American enterprise.Blasting powders for industries, mines, and quarries were becoming more important, and in 1857 the company produced a “soda powder” that was the first strictly industrial explosive. In 1880 DuPont began manufacturing nitroglycerin and dynamite.The company first incorporated in 1899, after nearly a century as a partnership. In 1907 it became the target of a U.S. antitrust suit because of its near monopoly of the American explosives industry, and in 1912 DuPont was forced to divest itself of a major proportion of its gunpowder business. In 1917 the company began buying an interest in General Motors Corporation and owned 25 percent of the stock at the end of 1925. In 1962, after 13 years of antitrust litigation, DuPont was ordered to divest itself of GM stock.

In 1904, as a by-product of its manufacture of explosives, DuPont began producing a special nitrocellulose for lacquers, leather finishes, and so on. The firm expanded into the manufacture of nitrocellulose plastics in 1915, and DuPont’s purchase of a number of firms in 1917 added product lines such as dyestuffs, paints, acids, and heavy chemicals. Its history of creating synthetic polymers made DuPont a world leader in the development of commercial polymers. DuPont introduced neoprene synthetic rubber in 1931 and nylon in 1938. Some of the more better-known synthetic materials developed by DuPont include Lucite, Teflon, Lycra, Orlon, Mylar, Kevlar, Tyvek, and Dacron polyester.As the firm’s product lines changed, so did its corporate management. From 1802 to 1940, all heads of the company were members of the du Pont family, and all but one (a son-in-law, presiding 1834–37) bore the du Pont name. This control was reinforced in 1915 by creation of the Christiana Securities Company, whose major stockholders were du Ponts and which had effective control (28 percent) of the shares of E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (newly incorporated that year). However, by the 1970s, under the tax laws, the du Ponts found the setup disadvantageous and in 1977 succeeded (after lengthy litigation) in having Christiana merged into the DuPont Company. Direction of the company was passing to persons unrelated to the du Ponts, and the company’s structure was changing: after 1940 only one chief executive was a du Pont (1962–67), and the company underwent extensive departmental reorganizations in 1967 and 1973–76, largely to streamline operations in the face of stiffening foreign competition.

In the 1980s DuPont acquired Conoco, Inc. (Continental Oil Company; spun off in 1998), in what was then the largest merger in corporate history. Additional mergers were undertaken in DuPont’s effort to diversify further. In 1986 the company introduced its stain-resistant Stainmaster carpets, which were soon the best-selling carpet brand in the United States. DuPont entered the global seed market in 1999 with its acquisition of Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the first commercial producer of hybrid seed corn. DuPont subsequently became one of the world’s largest producers of hybrid and genetically engineered seed plants.

In 2004 the company was fined $16.5 million by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for violating the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) by withholding information concerning its release into drinking water in West Virginia of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; also known as C8), which is known to cause developmental problems in laboratory animals. The company also faced litigation and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection with that incident. In 2006 DuPont and seven other companies agreed with the EPA to cut their production of PFOA by 95 percent by 2010 and to eliminate production completely by 2015.In 2015 the company merged with former rival Dow Chemical to form DowDuPont.

In 1802, he started a gunpowder mill on the Brandywine River in Delaware. His profits exploded when the U.S. government placed orders with him for the troops fighting in the War of 1812. E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company lives on as DuPont, with headquarters in Delaware and offices around the world.Early LifeE.I. du Pont was born Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours on June 24, 1771, in Paris. His father, Pierre Du Pont de Nemours, was a watchmaker by trade and later a publisher. In the years before the French Revolution, Pierre advised the monarchy on economic matters and was connected to Louis XVI.   As a youth, du Pont was not interested in academics, but showed a fascination with explosives, engaging in his own independent research. At age 14, he entered the Royal College in Paris, where he worked as an apprentice to renowned French chemist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier. Lavoisier advanced the young du Pont's knowledge of chemistry as well as botany and agriculture. A few years later, du Pont left the apprenticeship to manage his father's publishing house. Around this time, du Pont met Sophie Madeleine Dalmas and was immediately smitten with her. After much persistence and convincing, du Pont was able to obtain Sophie's father's permission to marry her. They wed in 1791 and went on to have eight children. Danger and a New FutureLike his father, du Pont initially supported the French Revolution, believing that the government could go through a peaceful transition to democracy. As the Revolution spun out of control in 1792, du Pont and members of his family found themselves defending the king from a mob besieging the Tuileries Palace in Paris. Though they succeeded in saving the king, the action made enemies within the revolutionary movement. As the Reign of Terror raged, Pierre du Pont narrowly escaped the guillotine in 1794. The du Pont family home was ransacked in 1797.Two years later, Éleuthère Irénée and Pierre du Pont sailed to the United States to find safety for the family. They landed in Rhode Island on January 1, 1800, and eventually the rest of the family came over and settled in Delaware. While hunting with a friend, Colonel Louis de Toussard, Éleuthère noted that American-made gunpowder was poor in quality and very expensive. Sensing an opportunity, du Pont traveled back to France with his brother, Victor, to obtain plans, machinery and financial support to start a gunpowder business in the United States. In 1803, he established E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. on the Brandywine River near Wilmington, Delaware. Success and ExpansionDu Pont was vigilant about the quality of his product. His efforts paid off, and by 1811, his company was the largest manufacturer of gunpowder in the United States. The du Ponts diversified their business, opening a woolen mill on the Brandywine River, as well as a cotton mill and a tannery, all of which were very successful. With a big boost in business during the War of 1812, du Pont poured most of his profits into the expanding business. The company also had some setbacks, with two explosions between 1815 and 1818 that resulted in nearly 50 deaths and considerable financial loss. But the company rebounded and continued to prosper. Later Life and DeathDu Pont served as president of the company for 32 years. His beloved wife, Sophie, died in 1828, bringing him much sadness. On October 31, 1834, Éleuthère Irénée du Pont died of heart failure. His descendants continued to grow the business, making it the second largest chemical company in the world.Fact CheckWe strive for accuracy and fairness.
