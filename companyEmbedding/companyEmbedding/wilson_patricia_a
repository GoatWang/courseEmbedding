The need to ensure that your business stays successful is to secure access to consistent, transparent and timely data, backed by independent views and thematics. My responsibility within Bloomberg has expanded as we have continued to build out our stack of company and industry coverage. Bloomberg Industries has been renamed Bloomberg Intelligence and is fuelled by almost 200+ street analysts with an average of 17 years experience. What does this stack now include: Company, Industry, Government, Legislation, ESG and Credit for over 4k companies. This independent analysis is backed by Bloomberg fundamental and proprietary data, and over 300 third party relationships. Our aim is to provide our clients with access to that data in a format that is easy to consume and fits into everyday workflow. We have done this by building over 100+ industry dashboards that house all of the relevant peers for quick reference on either business or valuation metrics, themes/topics/analysis, indicators and data (Bloomberg and 3rd party) for that Industry. Having all this information in one place can then facilitate quicker and more in-depth investment decisions without trawling through multiple websites and spreadsheets. Please take a quick look and contact me with any questions.BI <go> for Bloomberg intelligence, Bill <go> for up to the minute government Bills by industry or company list. Liti <Go> for legislation.

Overview


Overview

The intimate relationship with God you've yearned for is well within your grasp—despite the chaos of juggling multiple roles, deadlines, and commitments in your stretched-to-the-max life. With Quiet Spaces, you can learn to calm your mind and listen for God's still, small voice in the midst of the tumult around you. Author and former professional speaker Patricia Wilson knows what it's like to struggle with finding a few minutes for herself. Through Quiet Spaces she shows how even a few stray minutes can become a blessed opportunity for a focused encounter with God. Each brief prayer interlude featured in this book has 5 parts:   Calming — a passage from the Psalms to calm the mind Centering — a practice to focus on God Praying — a prayer for a particular situation or occasion Listening — a passage from the Gospels with the words of Jesus Returning — a practice to anchor the prayer experience   On hold for a phone call? Waiting for an appointment? In traffic? The quiet spaces are all around you! Capture those 5-minute breaks and use them to touch the hand of God. You can find time to pray and connect with God—let this unique devotional book help you discover how.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREThe Nuclear Fuel Cycle: From Ore To Wastesby Wilson, Patricia Dreame (Edt)The subject of nuclear power is fraught with controversy, and it is often discussed with an inadequate understanding of the science behind today's reactor technology. This book covers the entire nuclear fuel cycle, from mining uranium ore to disposal of radioactive wastes. It is intended for a broad audience of nonspecialist readers. Basic principles are fully explained, and topics such as environmental radioactivity--both naturally occurring and man-made--and safety issues are explored. Anyone interested in the operation of today's nuclear power-generating plants will want to have a copy of this informative volume.Nuclear EnergyCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
