History[edit]
At its founding in 1980, the company was named AntiVirals, Inc.[4] After occupying several research laboratory spaces in Corvallis, the company opened a production laboratory in Corvallis, Oregon, in February 2002 and was renamed AVI BioPharma Inc.[5] The company made headlines in 2003 when it announced work on treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the West Nile virus.[5][6] In July 2009, the company announced they would move their headquarters from Portland, Oregon, north to Bothell, Washington, near Seattle.[7] At that time the company led by president and CEO Leslie Hudson had 83 employees and quarterly revenues of $3.2 million.[7] AVI had yet to turn a profit nor developed any commercial products as of July 2009.[7] The company lost $19.7 million in the second quarter of 2009,[8] and then won a $11.5 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Threat Reduction Agency in October 2009.[9] By this time the company had completed its headquarters move to Bothell.[7][9]
In 2012 the company moved a second time, to Cambridge, Massachusetts. At the time, CEO Chris Garabedian indicated the move was motivated by the need to recruit expertise in rare diseases.[10] The Corvallis laboratory facility was closed in 2016.
Products[edit]
Its primary products are Morpholino oligomers (PMOs), synthetic nucleic acid analogs that were conceived of by James Summerton and invented by Summerton with Dwight Weller, and are being developed under the name NeuGene Antisense. Since morpholino oligomers can form sequence-specific double-stranded complexes with RNA they are suitable use in antisense therapy. In this application a morpholino oligomer binds to messenger RNA produced by a known disease-causing gene to prevent it from being translated into protein. Morpholinos have been tested for a wide range of applications including prevention of cardiac restenosis after angioplasty, treatment of coronary artery bypass grafts, treatment of polycystic kidney disease, redirection of drug metabolism, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and infectious diseases. Their greatest success thus far has been in DMD and as antiviral agents.
The Morpholino drug eteplirsen, targeting exon 51 of the dystrophin mRNA, has been approved as a human therapeutic by the FDA in 2016[11] and clinical trials for Morpholinos targeting other exons are ongoing. Morpholinos have been used in preclinical studies to inhibit replication of a broad range of viruses, including influenza, West Nile Virus, SARS, Hepatitis C, dengue fever, Ebola and Calicivirus, all of which are single stranded RNA viruses. They are in advanced development for prevention and treatment of Ebola and Marburg viruses. In March 2013, the Company announced positive results from a non-human primate study of AVI-7288, the drug candidate for treatment of Marburg virus infection. The results showed that intramuscular administration of AVI-7288 resulted in survival rates up to 100 percent in monkeys exposed to this fatal virus. These results are similar to those in previous studies when the drug was given by intravenous injection.[12]
In addition to development of Morpholinos as therapeutics, AVI has conducted six human trials for colorectal and pancreatic cancers using their cancer vaccine AVICINE.

					Full Description



Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., incorporated on June 5, 2013, is a biopharmaceutical company. The Company focuses on the discovery and development of ribose nucleic acid (RNA)-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases. The Company operates through discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering therapies to patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The Company is primarily focused on the development of its disease-modifying DMD drug candidates.The Company has received accelerated approval for its product, EXONDYS 51, indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 is studied in clinical trials under the name of eteplirsen. The Company is in the process of planning several studies for eteplirsen and product candidates targeting skipping of exon 53 and/or exon 45. It is also conducting an open label extension of the Phase IIb study for which patients can transition to commercial drug after certain criteria are met (Study 4658-us-202), an open label study on ambulatory patients with a concurrent untreated control arm (Study 4658-301/PROMOVI), a study evaluating the safety and tolerability of eteplirsen in participants with advanced stage DMD (Study 4658-204) and a study evaluating the safety and tolerability of eteplirsen in participants with early stage DMD (Study 4658-203), each of which will allow for patients to transition to commercial drug after meeting certain criteria. The Company is also planning two additional Phase I studies.The Company is enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE (Study 4045-301), its Phase III placebo controlled confirmatory trial in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping using SRP-4045 and SRP-4053, respectively. SRP-4053, an exon 53-skipping product candidate that it has selected for development through the SKIP-NMD consortium, is in the clinic in European Union (EU) as part of a Phase I/II study. Part I has been completed and Part II, an open label portion of this study, is ongoing (Study 4053-101). It is also enrolling and dosing patients amenable to exon 45 skipping in ESSENCE, its placebo controlled study for eteplirsen. SRP-4045, an exon 45-skipping product candidate that it selected for development in collaboration with Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) in Washington, D.C. and the Carolinas Medical Center (CMC) in Charlotte, N.C. In addition to EXONDYS 51, the Company's DMD pipeline includes other product candidates, which are at various stages of development.The Company's next generation phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO)-based compounds are synthetic compounds that bind to complementary sequences of RNA by standard Watson-Crick nucleobase pairing. When targeted to messenger RNA (mRNA), PMO-based compounds down-regulate protein translation by steric blockade. Its PMO-based chemistries include peptide conjugated PMO (PPMO), PMO-X and PMOplus. PPMO technology features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of cellular delivery into the cytosol and the nucleus. PMOplus features the selective introduction of positive charges to the PMO backbone and it has potentially therapeutic applications, especially for anti-viral therapeutics. PMO-X incorporates chemical modifications to the PMO backbone linkages.

In March 2013, the Company announced positive results from a non-human primate study of AVI-7288, the drug candidate for treatment of Marburg virus infection. The results showed that intramuscular administration of AVI-7288 resulted in survival rates up to 100 percent in monkeys exposed to this fatal virus. These results are similar to those in previous studies when the drug was given by intravenous injection.[12]
In addition to development of Morpholinos as therapeutics, AVI has conducted six human trials for colorectal and pancreatic cancers using their cancer vaccine AVICINE.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Announce Execution of a Global Settlement and a License Agreement Resolving Exon Skipping Patent LitigationGlobeNewswire•July 18, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareCAMBRIDGE, Mass. and SAN RAFAEL, Calif., July 18, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (SRPT), a U.S. commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases, and BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN), a leading biotechnology company in therapies for rare genetic diseases, announced today that Sarepta and BioMarin executed a license agreement that provides Sarepta Therapeutics with global exclusive rights to BioMarin’s DMD patent estate for EXONDYS 51 and all future exon-skipping products. BioMarin retains the right to convert the license to a co-exclusive right in the event it decides to proceed with an exon-skipping therapy for DMD. In addition, Sarepta and BioMarin executed a settlement agreement, resolving the ongoing worldwide patent proceedings related to the use of EXONDYS 51 and all future exon-skipping products for the treatment of DMD. The effectiveness of the agreements is subject to closing conditions including execution of necessary approvals by Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (AZL) by July 24, 2017.Under the terms of the license and settlement agreements, Sarepta will make a one-time payment of $35 million to BioMarin and certain additional regulatory and commercial milestone payments for exons 51, 45, 53 and possibly on future exon-skipping products.In addition, Sarepta will pay royalties to BioMarin as follows:Exon-skipping compounds 51, 45, and 53 and possibly on future exon-skipping products: Sarepta will pay BioMarin 5 percent of net sales through the end of 2023 in the United States; andExon-skipping compounds 51, 45, and 53 and possibly on future exon-skipping products: Sarepta will pay BioMarin 8 percent of net sales through September 30, 2024 in the European Union and in other countries where certain BioMarin / AZL patents exist.“Upon their effectiveness, these global license and settlement agreements provide Sarepta worldwide freedom to operate for EXONDYS 51 and our future exon-skipping products,” said Douglas Ingram, Sarepta’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “The resolution of these legal matters provides us with more certainty to fully focus our resources and energy on our crucial mission of developing innovative medicines to improve the lives of those impacted by DMD around the world."“We are pleased to reach a global settlement and license agreement with Sarepta that fairly recognizes the important innovation by the Leiden University Medical Center and allows patients certainty that this issue will not create a barrier to access,” said G. Eric Davis, BioMarin’s Executive Vice President and General Counsel.About EXONDYS 51EXONDYS 51 uses Sarepta’s proprietary phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. EXONDYS 51 is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to allow for production of an internally truncated dystrophin protein. Data from clinical studies of EXONDYS 51 in a small number of DMD patients have demonstrated a consistent safety and tolerability profile. The pivotal trials were not designed to evaluate long-term safety and a clinical benefit of EXONDYS 51 has not been established.Important Safety InformationAdverse reactions in DMD patients (N=8) treated with EXONDYS 51 30 or 50 mg/kg/week by intravenous (IV) infusion with an incidence of at least 25% more than placebo (N=4) (Study 1, 24 weeks) were (EXONDYS 51, placebo): balance disorder (38%, 0%), vomiting (38%, 0%) and contact dermatitis (25%, 0%). The most common adverse reactions were balance disorder and vomiting. Because of the small numbers of patients, these represent crude frequencies that may not reflect the frequencies observed in practice. The 50 mg/kg once weekly dosing regimen of EXONDYS 51 is not recommended.In the 88 patients who received ≥30 mg/kg/week of EXONDYS 51 for up to 208 weeks in clinical studies, the following events were reported in ≥10% of patients and occurred more frequently than on the same dose in Study 1: vomiting, contusion, excoriation, arthralgia, rash, catheter site pain, and upper respiratory tract infection.There have been reports of transient erythema, facial flushing, and elevated temperature occurring on the day of EXONDYS 51 infusion.About Sarepta TherapeuticsSarepta Therapeutics is a U.S. commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases.
