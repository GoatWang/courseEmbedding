(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements, related notes, and other detailed information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), contemplate that we will continue as a going concern, and do not contain any adjustments that might result if we were unable to continue as a going concern, however, our independent registered public accounting firm has added explanatory paragraphs in Note 1 of each of our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Certain information contained below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information regarding our plans and strategy for our business, constitute forward-looking statements. See "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."  Overview  We are a development stage company organized under the laws of the State of Nevada in January 2006. Our business is to develop and operate Internet websites and mobile phone applications and we intend to earn revenues through advertisements sold on these websites and mobile platforms. Our goal is to become the largest network of consumer-based websites and iPhone applications and similar mobile platforms targeting viewers in the Hong Kong and Greater China Basin with contents on travel, food, entertainment, activities and city life. We plan to develop additional websites and mobile phone applications. We generate advertising revenues through banner and pay-per-click advertisements, as well as through application user fees.  Results of Operations  Two Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015  Net Sales  We generated revenues of $7,538 for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $8,292 for fiscal 2015. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to discounts offered to our advertisers. Our principal source of revenues is from advertising banners on our websites. We also intend to generate future revenues from advertising and user fees related to our mobile phone applications.  Net Income (Loss)  We have incurred a net loss of $79,929 in 2016 compared to a net loss of $74,008 in 2015, principally due to a substantial increase in our administrative expenses as discussed below.  We had other income of $11,077 in 2016 and $nil in 2015, attributable to the write-off of accrued director fees and secretary fees.  We incurred general, administrative and operating expenses of $98,544 in 2016 and $82,300 in 2015. Of these amounts, $nil and $31,500 related to the value of director fees to our directors in each of 2016 and 2015, respectively, in lieu of cash compensation for services rendered. In addition, a substantial portion of our expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to accounting service fees, legal service fees and professional service fees, and for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to accounting service fees and professional service fees.  Taxes  Due to our lack of revenues, we have not incurred any tax obligations since inception. However, we would anticipate that income tax obligations will arise as we begin to generate significant revenue in the future.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  At December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7,833, compared to $39 at December 31, 2015, an increase of $7,794. This increase is principally due to the increase in cash provided in operation.  Currently, we have limited operating capital. We expect that our current capital and our other existing resources will be sufficient only to provide a limited amount of working capital, and the revenues, if any, generated from our business operations alone may not be sufficient to fund our operations or planned growth. We will likely require additional capital to continue to operate our business, and to further expand our business.  We expect our cash flow needs over the next 12 months to be approximately $80,000. However, this amount may be materially increased if market conditions are favorable for a more rapid expansion of our business model or if we adjust our model to exploit strategic acquisition opportunities. In addition, we may require additional cash flow to support our public company reporting requirements in the United States. Although our average monthly expenditures to date have averaged less than $6,700, we expect this rate to increase exponentially as our business expands. To date, we have been financed principally by our directors; however, we expect to secure third party financing or bank loans as necessary until we secure sufficient revenues, principally from advertisers on our websites, to sustain our ongoing operations.  Sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements with third parties may include equity or debt financing, bank loans or revolving credit facilities. We may not be successful in locating suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all, and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. Our inability to raise additional funds when required may have a negative impact on our operations, business development and financial results.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. As the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase, these judgments become even more subjective and complex. We have identified the following accounting policies, described below, as the most critical to an understanding of our current financial condition and results of operations.  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  The Company accounts for the impairment of long-lived assets, such as plant and equipment, leasehold land and intangible assets, under the provisions of FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 360 ("ASC 360") "Property, Plant and Equipment - Overall" (formerly known as SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets" ("SFAS 144")). ASC 360 establishes the accounting for impairment of long-lived tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill and for the disposal of a business. Pursuant to ASC 360, the Company periodically evaluates, at least annually, whether facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long-lived asset, or the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. In the event that the carrying amount of long-lived assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, then the carrying amount of such assets is adjusted to their fair value. The Company reports an impairment cost as a charge to operations at the time it is recognized.  Income Taxes  The Company utilizes FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 740 ("ASC 740") "Income taxes" (formerly known as SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"), which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  ASC 740 "Income taxes" (formerly known as Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("FIN 48")) clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. This interpretation requires that an entity recognizes in the financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgement occurs. The Company has elected to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits, if and when required, as part of income tax expense in the statements of operations. The adoption of ASC 740 did not have a significant effect on the financial statements.  Comprehensive Income  The Company has adopted FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 220 ("ASC 220") "Comprehensive income" (formerly known as SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income"), which establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated balances. Accumulated other comprehensive income represents the accumulated balance of foreign currency translation adjustments of the Company.  Stock-based Compensation  The Company has adopted FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 718 ("ASC 718"), "Stock Compensation" (formerly known as SFAS 123(R), Share-Based Payment), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including stock option grants based on estimated fair values. ASC 718 requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the award's portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods. Prior to the adoption of ASC 718, we accounted for share-based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method, share-based compensation expense was only recognized by us if the exercise price of the stock option was less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant.  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation to non-employees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC 505-50 "Equity -Based Payments to Non-employees". Measurement of share-based payment transactions with non-employees shall be based on the fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received; or (b) the equity instruments issued. The fair value of the share-based payment transactions should be determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance completion date.  Issuance of Shares for Service  The Company accounts for the issuance of equity instruments to acquire goods and services based on the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of issuance, whichever is more reliably measurable.  Foreign Currencies Translation  The functional currency of the Company is Hong Kong dollars ("HK$"). The Company maintains its financial statements in the functional currency. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet dates. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchanges rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Exchange gains or losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of net income for the respective periods.  For financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the Group which are prepared using the functional currency have been translated into United States dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and stockholders' equity is translated at historical exchange rates. Any translation adjustments resulting are not included in determining net income but are included in foreign exchange adjustment to other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  The carrying values of the Company's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, deposits, trade and other payables approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturity of such instruments. The carrying amounts of borrowings approximate their fair values because the applicable interest rates approximate current market rates.  Earnings Per Share  Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period while the effects of potential common shares outstanding during the period are included in diluted earnings per share. The average market price during the year is used to compute equivalent shares.  FASB Accounting Standard Codification Topic 260 ("ASC 260"), "Earnings Per Share," requires that employee equity share options, non-vested shares and similar equity instruments granted to employees be treated as potential common shares in computing diluted earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share should be based on the actual number of options or shares granted and not yet forfeited, unless doing so would be anti-dilutive. The Company uses the "treasury stock" method for equity instruments granted in share-based payment transactions provided in ASC 260 to determine diluted earnings per share.  Website Development Costs  The Company recognized the costs associated with developing a website in accordance with ASC 350-50 "Website Development Cost" that codified the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") Statement of Position ("SOP") NO. 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use". Relating to website development costs the Company follows the guidance pursuant to the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) NO. 00-2, "Accounting for Website Development Costs". The website development costs are divided into three stages, planning, development and production. The development stage can further be classified as application and infrastructure development, graphics development and content development. In short, website development cost for internal use should be capitalized except content input and data conversion costs in content development stage.  Costs associated with the website consist primarily of website development costs paid to third party and directors. These capitalized costs will be amortized based on their estimated useful life over three years upon the website becoming operational. Internal costs related to the development of website content will be charged to operations as incurred. Web-site development costs related to the customers are charged to cost of sales.  Revenue Recognition  The Company recognized revenues from advertising insertion revenue in the period in which the advertisement is displayed, provided that evidence of an arrangement exists, the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. If fixed-fee advertising is displayed over a term greater than one month, revenues are recognized ratably over the period as described below. The majority of insertion orders have terms that begin and end in a quarterly reporting period. In the cases where at the end of a quarterly reporting period the term of an insertion order is not complete, the Company recognizes revenue for the period by pro-rating the total arrangement fee to revenue and deferred revenue based on a measure of proportionate performance of its obligation under the insertion order. The Company measures proportionate performance by the number of placements delivered and undelivered as of the reporting date.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 ("ASU 2016-01"), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This amendment requires all equity investments to be measured at fair value, with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Group does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 ("ASU 2016-02"), Leases. ASU 2016-02 specifies the accounting for leases. For operating leases, ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, in its balance sheet. The standard also requires a lessee to recognize a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, on a generally straight-line basis. In addition, this standard requires both lessees and lessors to disclose certain key information about lease transactions. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Group does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 ("ASU 2016-09"), Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows; (d) accounting for forfeitures of share-based payments. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Group does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Group does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which clarifies the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Group does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash. The guidance requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim period within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The standard should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Group does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which clarifies the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The standard should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Group does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  In January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2017-04, "Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment." The guidance removes Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment will now be the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The guidance should be adopted on a prospective basis for the annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The Group does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
