The American International Group said on Tuesday that it had hired Douglas A. Dachille as its chief investment officer, succeeding a longtime executive in the role.Mr. Dachille will join the insurance giant after it buys First Principles Capital Management, his investment firm with about $10 billion in assets under management, for an undisclosed price.In becoming A.I.G.’s chief investment officer, overseeing the company’s huge swath of holdings, he will succeed William N. Dooley, who is retiring after spending 37 years at the insurer.Before founding First Principles, Mr. Dachille worked at Zurich Capital Markets, and before that at JPMorgan Chase, where he once served as global head of proprietary trading and co-treasurer.“Doug is a leader in financial services and investments and has an extensive track record in all aspects of asset management, structured finance and risk management at global companies,” Peter D. Hancock, A.I.G.’s chief executive, said in a statement. “The First Principles investment team is a uniquely talented group, and their customized asset management services align with A.I.G.’s commitment to providing the highest level of solutions-oriented services to clients.”The acquisition of First Principles is expected to close by Sept. 30.

AIG Names Douglas Dachille Chief Investment Officer; AIG Acquires 
      First Principles Capital Management






July 28, 2015 08:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) announced today that 
      Douglas A. Dachille, Chief Executive Officer of First Principles Capital 
      Management, LLC (First Principles), will become Executive Vice President 
      and Chief Investment Officer of AIG, succeeding William N. Dooley, 
      Executive Vice President, Investments, who is retiring. Additionally, 
      AIG is acquiring First Principles, a privately held investment 
      management firm. The transaction is expected to close in the third 
      quarter of 2015.
    


      Mr. Dachille will report to Peter D. Hancock, President and Chief 
      Executive Officer of AIG, and will join AIG’s Operating Committee. Prior 
      to leading First Principles for 11 years, Mr. Dachille was President of 
      Zurich Capital Markets. He began his career at JPMorgan Chase & Co., 
      where he held a variety of positions, including Global Head of 
      Proprietary Trading and co-Treasurer, and built the Hybrid Derivatives 
      business.
    

      “We are excited to bring Doug and his talented team on board,” Mr. 
      Hancock said. “Doug is a leader in financial services and investments, 
      and has an extensive track record in all aspects of asset management, 
      structured finance, and risk management at global companies. The First 
      Principles investment team is a uniquely talented group, and their 
      customized asset management services align with AIG’s commitment to 
      providing the highest level of solutions-oriented services to clients.
    

      “I also want to extend my deepest appreciation for all of the 
      accomplishments made by Bill Dooley,” Mr. Hancock said. “Bill joined AIG 
      in 1978 and served in many key financial management and investment roles 
      in his distinguished career with the firm. His guidance and leadership 
      will be missed, but I know he will work closely with Doug as he 
      transitions into his role as our Chief Investment Officer.”
    

      First Principles, a fixed income investment manager with approximately 
      $10 billion of assets under management, provides customized investment 
      management services to institutional clients, including endowments and 
      foundations, corporate trusts, financial institutions, and pension 
      plans, as well as to family offices and private clients. First 
      Principles will continue to operate its business as a wholly-owned 
      subsidiary of AIG, headquartered in New York City. Richard F. Dolan, 
      First Principles’ Chief Financial Officer and Managing Partner, will 
      become the firm’s Chief Executive Officer, reporting to Mr. Dachille. 
      Mark G. Alexandridis will become the firm’s Chief Investment Officer.
