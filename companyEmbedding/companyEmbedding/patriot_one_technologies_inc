      Overview    

Patriot One Technologies Inc. aims to directly address the very real and growing Active Threat phenomena which has become a significant force for shaping research in weapons detection. Since the 1970’s many parts of the world have experienced ongoing increases in acts of international terrorism, with increasing numbers of domestic Active Shooter incidents occurring with disturbing frequency. In response, Patriot One and a respected university led research team have developed the basis for portable devices and software solutions to assist military and civilian security personnel in the detection of concealed weapons. The technology, which is intended to be placed in entryways and other key locations, utilizes radio wave emissions to safely target, identify and notify of concealed threat potential through software recognition of specific wavelength patterns. Early warning is the key to effective deployment of timely countermeasures, and Patriot One is commercializing its PATSCAN™ CMR technology as an automated alert system capable of covertly screening moving individuals for on-body concealed weapons (handguns, knives, grenades, explosive vests, etc.).

Patriot One Technologies’ (TSX.V: PAT) (OTCQB: PTOTF) PATSCAN Defends Against Terrorists and Active Shooters
July 24, 2017




PATSCAN CMR™ technology to detect concealed weapons & ordnance
Microwave radar technology developed in collaboration with McMaster University
Non-intrusive system units can be deployed covertly

Patriot One Technologies, Inc. (TSX.V: PAT) (OTCQB: PTOTF) is on the frontline of the fight against terrorists and active shooters, the latter defined by law enforcement agencies as ‘an individual or individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area’. In collaboration with McMaster University of Canada, the company has developed novel technology which detects weapons and other ordnance carried into public spaces and reduces the risk posed by malevolent actors. Unlike present weapons detection systems, the Patriot One units employing this innovative technology can be deployed without the knowledge or awareness of those being scanned. In addition, there is no stop-and-scan or intrusive invasions of privacy. With its new PATSCAN technology, Patriot One is offering airports, train stations, nightclubs, concert venues and other public arenas the capability to deter, detect and defend against terrorists and active shooters.
Patriot One’s preemptive approach to warding off gun and bomb violence employs cutting-edge microwave radar technology linked to machine algorithms. The low-power radar system scans people and property as they pass through the field of the device. This data is relayed continuously to sophisticated algorithms that access a database of ordnance “signatures” and make a determination, in real time, of a possible security threat. By running the scan against the signatures in the database, the system quickly identifies whether someone is carrying a gun, knife, bomb or some other potentially dangerous device or object.
Patriot One’s PATSCAN, developed in collaboration with researchers from McMaster University, is markedly different from traditional weapons detection technology. Current weapons detection systems are highly visible and tend to create the sort of ominous atmosphere one might expect in a prison, perhaps, but not at a teenage pop concert. However, PATSCAN can be deployed covertly behind walls, ceilings and floor panels and is, in effect, invisible to the public. Consequently, it increases the likelihood that an actor with malicious intent will give himself away. The technology, which will certainly prove disruptive to the security industry, is rather less so in operation. It requires no stop-and-scan; no searching of handbags and emptying of pockets; and no body scans that may violate the norms of privacy or decency. In many ways, PATSCAN CMR is clean technology, and its merits are getting a nod from industry experts.
Earlier this year, the company announced the Security Industry Association (SIA) had recognized it as winners of the Anti-Terrorism / Force Protection category in the New Product Showcase (NPS) component of the ISC West industry trade show and conference in Las Vegas, Nevada (http://dtn.fm/8pwAK). SIA NPS judges are highly skilled and experienced in security technology design and application and are required to have a minimum of 10 years experience in the selection, purchase and or installation of products within the category that they are judging. The PATSCAN has, so far, achieved a 94 percent true positive detection, which is far ahead of traditional metal detector rates.
Patriot’s order book is growing, and inquiries from potential clients and distributors continue to pour in. Last month, one such inquiry, from Down Under, blossomed into a new partnership. Patriot One announced it had entered into a reseller agreement with accredited national systems integration experts Aotea Security (NZ) Ltd. of Dunedin, New Zealand (http://dtn.fm/7UsxI). Aotea Security is the security specialist arm of the Aotea Group of companies, which provides New Zealand’s only truly nationwide solution for electronic security, electrical, fire, and communications services.
Patriot One is now in the process of obtaining certification from Industry Canada and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the U.S. for its commercial PATSCAN units. The company hopes to start shipping commercial units in the fall.

NetworkNewsWire Releases Exclusive Audio Interview with Patriot One Technologies, Inc. (PTOTF) 



NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Jul 18, 2017) -  NetworkNewsWire ("NNW"), a multifaceted financial news and publishing company that delivers a new generation of social communication solutions for business, today announces the online availability of its interview with Patriot One Technologies Inc. (TSX VENTURE: PAT) (OTCQB: PTOTF), a technology company focused on providing security and fighting terrorism with its award-winning PATSCAN CMR™ concealed weapons detection system.
The interview can be heard at https://www.networknewswire.com/solutions/corporate-communications/interviews/patriot-one-technologies-interview/
Kicking off the interview, NNW's Stuart Smith introduces Martin Cronin, CEO and director of Patriot One Technologies, who describes the innovation of the Company's concealed weapon detection technology. 
"What we are providing is a truly disruptive technology where our system can be deployed covertly behind walls, behind ceiling panels, wall panels, and just scan people without them needing to stop, without them being inconvenienced in any way and, critically, without them necessarily knowing that the scan has happened," says Cronin.
Patriot One's unique technology works by combining a low-power radar with machine learning algorithms to make a real-time determination of whether a person is carrying a concealed weapon, such as a gun or a knife or a bomb.
The system is fundamentally different from weapon detection technology currently in use, such as airport screening systems, handheld metal detector wands and metal detector arches. One area of differentiation is visibility. While traditional types of equipment are visible to the people being scanned, Patriot One's PATSCAN CMR™ system can covertly monitor passers-by.
After working for 21 years for the British government in a variety of roles, including counterterrorism in the Middle East and South Asia, Cronin is leveraging his international knowledge of high-risk environments to help create Patriot One's technology. 
Though the Company isn't yet shipping a commercial product, it is gearing up to address increasing demands for its products from around the world. Patriot One has set a modest target for the number of units it planned on placing in clients' hands by the end of 2017. 
"As it turns out we've had such demand that even before we can start installing those units, pretty much all of our volume that we anticipated for this year is already committed and we have new distributors coming online on a weekly basis," says Cronin. "New clients come to us on a daily basis." 
To meet the surging demand from locations as diverse as New Zealand, South Africa, Britain, the Caribbean, and Latin America, Patriot One is seeking regional distributors and other partners with field service engineering capabilities.
"Our strategy at the moment is based upon identifying partners who have that bench strength and that field presence to allow us to address this market which is really just coming toward us at full speed at the moment," Cronin said.
Patriot One Technologies is the proud winner of the 2017 Security Industry Association's New Product Showcase in the Anti-terrorism/Force Protection category, which was a huge validation from a very distinguished panel, says Cronin. Taking a technology from a lab environment and producing it commercially involves a lot of uncertainty.
"Going from a situation where we could take the lab equipment out into the field, scanning 46 weapons types and delivering an accuracy rate of about 94% true positive detection -- which is just so far ahead of a metal detector -- it's in another world," he adds. 
Patriot One is now in the process of acquiring certifications in the U.S. and Canada, a significant milestone that will enable the Company to start shipping its units to meet demand.
About Patriot One Technologies, Inc.

        NEW YORK, NY-(Jul 18, 2017) - NetworkNewsWire ('NNW'), a multifaceted financial news and publishing company that delivers a new generation of social communication solutions for business, today announces the online availability of its interview with Patriot One Technologies Inc. (TSX VENTURE: PAT) (OTCQB: PTOTF), a technology company focused on providing security and fighting terrorism with its award-winning PATSCAN CMR™ concealed weapons detection system.
      

        The interview can be heard at https://www.networknewswire.com/solutions/corporate-communications/interviews/patriot-one-technologies-interview/


        Kicking off the interview, NNW's Stuart Smith introduces Martin Cronin, CEO and director of Patriot One Technologies, who describes the innovation of the Company's concealed weapon detection technology.
      

        'What we are providing is a truly disruptive technology where our system can be deployed covertly behind walls, behind ceiling panels, wall panels, and just scan people without them needing to stop, without them being inconvenienced in any way and, critically, without them necessarily knowing that the scan has happened,' says Cronin.
      

        Patriot One's unique technology works by combining a low-power radar with machine learning algorithms to make a real-time determination of whether a person is carrying a concealed weapon, such as a gun or a knife or a bomb.
      

        The system is fundamentally different from weapon detection technology currently in use, such as airport screening systems, handheld metal detector wands and metal detector arches. One area of differentiation is visibility. While traditional types of equipment are visible to the people being scanned, Patriot One's PATSCAN CMR™ system can covertly monitor passers-by.
      

        After working for 21 years for the British government in a variety of roles, including counterterrorism in the Middle East and South Asia, Cronin is leveraging his international knowledge of high-risk environments to help create Patriot One's technology.
      

        Though the Company isn't yet shipping a commercial product, it is gearing up to address increasing demands for its products from around the world. Patriot One has set a modest target for the number of units it planned on placing in clients' hands by the end of 2017.
      

        'As it turns out we've had such demand that even before we can start installing those units, pretty much all of our volume that we anticipated for this year is already committed and we have new distributors coming online on a weekly basis,' says Cronin. 'New clients come to us on a daily basis.'
      

        To meet the surging demand from locations as diverse as New Zealand, South Africa, Britain, the Caribbean, and Latin America, Patriot One is seeking regional distributors and other partners with field service engineering capabilities.
      

        'Our strategy at the moment is based upon identifying partners who have that bench strength and that field presence to allow us to address this market which is really just coming toward us at full speed at the moment,' Cronin said.
      

        Patriot One Technologies is the proud winner of the 2017 Security Industry Association's New Product Showcase in the Anti-terrorism/Force Protection category, which was a huge validation from a very distinguished panel, says Cronin. Taking a technology from a lab environment and producing it commercially involves a lot of uncertainty.
      

        'Going from a situation where we could take the lab equipment out into the field, scanning 46 weapons types and delivering an accuracy rate of about 94% true positive detection - which is just so far ahead of a metal detector - it's in another world,' he adds.
      

        Patriot One is now in the process of acquiring certifications in the U.S. and Canada, a significant milestone that will enable the Company to start shipping its units to meet demand.

PATSCAN™ Product Demonstration Video

Current technology requires compliance on the part of the target subject. With a fixed installation at a secure facility, perimeter controls require costly operator manpower and can be avoided during a dedicated assault. Individual screening with equipment that requires line-of-site and millimeter bandwidth scans are slow and prone to operator errors or false-positive results along with increasing privacy concerns. Expensive and slow, increased deployment of large fixed detection equipment will inevitably shift threats to “softer” less secure targets.
Practical detectors must be reasonably priced, small, covertly located, simple to operate, safe to health, have an intelligent yes/no decision making capability, and possess a low false alarm rate in the presence of strong relative interference and a background of innocuous normally carried metal.

Patriot One Technologies in partnership with researchers from Canada’s McMaster University have developed a solution that employs near field radar in a manner that addresses all the factors outlined above in a cost-effective system that is being developed for commercial application in public locations within a realistically short time-frame.
CURRENT TECHNOLOGY FAILS FOR MANY REASONS



 








      Smart Detection Gets Small and Practical    


      Radar Technology on a Chip    

Advances in radar technology leads to weapons detection adaptation

Semiconductor technology now routinely allows microwave circuits to be packaged into Integrated Circuits (IC).
Microwave radars have been in military service for years, but not widely deployed in commercial or consumer applications because of expense. Until now.
A variety of applications have arisen, such as liquid-level measurement, motion detection, door openers, intrusion alarms and police speed meters.



 









      Effectiveness    

The most widespread use of both microwave and millimeter-wave radar is automotive safety devices, including adaptive cruise control, automatic braking, collision warning, blind spot detection, lane departure warning, and backup object detection. While not the same as PATSCAN™ CMR hardware technology, the applicability as a result of miniaturization is similar.

A key advantage of microwave radar is its fine resolution in detecting small objects.
A multi-receiver version permits even finer precision in detecting objects and at wider angles.
In some instances both receiver and transceiver are on a single chip.
The Patriot One technology currently offers a high-grade effective operating range of approximately 2 meters (6.5 feet).

Patriot One Technologies May Revolutionize Site Security - Patriot One Technologies Inc. (OTCMKTS:PTOTF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Patriot One Technologies May Revolutionize Site SecurityJul. 6.17 | About: Patriot One (PTOTF) M Plaut Long only, special situations, dividend investing, valueSummaryPossibly a disruptive new technology in site security.Patriot One has won a major award for its technology.The company already has orders for 90% of its 2017 production.In its first year of public operation, Patriot One Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB:PTOTF) (TSX.V:PAT) (FRA:0PL) has won a major award for its new weapons scanning system, as well as signed agreements with important distributors and moved closer to being able to provide a steady supply of a commercial product. 

 Although it has only been trading since last November, Patriot One has made impressive progress. It won, on Wednesday April 5th, the first place in the Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Category in the New Product Showcase (NPS) component of the ISC West industry trade show and conference in Las Vegas, NV, the premier platform for security professionals to evaluate new products and technologies for use in security applications. The security screening equipment that is now in use at airports uses millimeter wave technology that is big, slow and expensive. People and packages must pass through special frames in which they are scanned for concealed weapons. This method also raises serious privacy questions. The Patriot One system uses microwave technology that is small, fast and cheap. It can screen objects in real time as they move along, and is not disruptive of normal, innocent traffic. The new system focuses on suspicious items, raising no privacy issues. The Patriot One system is an integrated hardware and software solution that immediately identifies objects of interest being carried in a single scan. It then makes a determination if they are a threat by comparing the new discovery to its constantly updated database of known threats. In this way, it can distinguish a smartphone from a knife or a gun. There are no privacy issues since it only zeroes in on the object it finds. To highlight the various components of the system, the company calls its breakthrough: cognitive microwave radar (CMR) technology.
 

 The basic package to be deployed is a small box that can be easily concealed to a screen passing people without intruding on their progress. If it identifies a threat, the information is transmitted through pre-established channels to security personnel and/or automatic machinery for an appropriate response. 

 The technology has the potential for very widespread use. I recall that somewhere it wrote that the company would charge $10,000 for an installation plus a modest monthly fee to cover the ongoing and updated database. The company has not released any sort of estimates or projections for sales, but it has enormous potential. Among potential locations that are candidates for the use of this technology, the company has identified 98,000 public schools in the USA alone (each school +10 entrances), 50,000 Federal buildings in US alone, 294 US embassies/consulates globally, 260 Canadian government offices in 150 countries, cinemas - in the US alone the top 4 chains represent 39,356 indoor screens in 5,463 sites and 656 drive-in screens in 393 sites - and also over 200 stadiums (with cap. over 30,000) just in North America alone each with multiple entrances. It is also cheap and flexible enough to be used on public transportation, including 600,000 public school buses in the US alone (each bus has two doors), 270 subway stations in London alone, 4,660 US passenger transit stations nationwide, and 1,751 airports in 174 countries and territories.
 The company is following a low-capital business model, maintaining patents and an engineering staff, but outsourcing the manufacture of the products itself. In a message at the beginning of May summarizing Q1 and talking about plans for the future, President Dinesh Kandanchatha said that the central aim of the company is to deliver products in Q4 2017. A month later, the company said that it had $2.7M in signed agreements from around the world. The president also noted that in field trials "the system successfully and consistently detected concealed weapons with zero false negatives and a false positive rate of less than 5 per cent." What this means is that it detected all weapons (no false negatives) but it flagged a few non-weapons as threats (less than five percent false positives). This performance can be expected to improve with more experience, but in any case it is an err-on-the-side-of-caution type of performance. Presumably these would be checked out by the security staff and should not be a problem. 

 What is still lacking is FCC and Industry Canada certification. At that time, the president wrote that the company hoped to submit for certification before the end of Q2. If everything is on target, the certification submission is already in, but if not, submission is probably imminent. The president wrote that the company's internal testing indicated that its "production system can meet or exceed all the requirements for both FCC and Industry Canada certification while meeting our commitment to maintain the highest possible standard of efficacy." The company hopes to have certification by the end of the summer. It has already had requests from some customers for them to apply for special waivers that are possible under certification exemption guidelines.
 

 

 The company's chief science advisor is Dr. Natalia K. Nikolova, who is a professor of electrical engineering at McMaster University and a Canada research chair in high-frequency electromagnetics. She began the research in 2009 under the sponsorship of Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC). DRDC sponsored a project that involved professors from four Canadian universities - Royal Military College, Queen's University, McMaster University and the University of Toronto - and one US university - Pennsylvania State University - to carry out preliminary feasibility studies. In an interview in the company's newsletter, she said that investors contacted McMaster University in December 2015 and proceeded toward commercialization activities immediately after a partnership was formed. Patriot One was established as a startup company for the sole purpose of bringing this solution to market. The company has signed agreements with resellers in Canada, the US, the UK and South Africa. It recently signed an agreement with a relatively large reseller in New Zealand, Aotea Security. Did Anyone Say Dilution? So far the price of the stock has hovered around US$0.60 (plus or minus). No one has missed anything by not buying up until now. On the other hand, the company's low-capital business model, plus the forecast first sales already in Q4, suggests that there will not be massive dilution before sales start rolling in.
 Furthermore, the company did raise funds in the middle of June, and the amount was relatively modest, for a total of $4 million (Canadian). It has not yet had any meaningful business operations, so its financial statements so far are of no interest. The company still seems to be largely under the radar of investors, and there is a possibility of an explosive rise in the stock price once word gets out. There is no way to know when this will be. The potential is certainly very great, but the company is still in startup mode and you should not invest any money that you cannot afford to lose.

Patriot One Marks 3-Months of Global PATSCAN Sales with $2.7M in Signed Agreements






 TORONTO, ON--(Marketwired - Jun 13, 2017) -  Patriot One Technologies Inc. (TSX VENTURE: PAT) (OTCQB: PTOTF) (FRANKFURT: 0PL) ("Patriot One" or the "Company"), developer of the award-winning PATSCAN CMR™ concealed weapons detection system, is pleased to report that in the three months since product marketing began during the lead up to the ISC West trade show in Las Vegas, confirmed sales commitments now top $2.7 million.
Patriot One sales efforts are currently focused on categories including houses of worship, academic institutions, event centres, casinos, commercial offices, hotel properties, government agencies and other locations at high risk of terrorist attack. Orders have been received from locations spanning four continents, and new territorial opportunities are opening as reseller influence grows. 
Patriot One President and CTO Dinesh Kandanchatha notes, "Our roll-out program initially conceived finalizing our engineering in early spring in order to meet Industry Canada and FCC certification requirements by late summer. This timing also aligns with our go-to-market packaging initiative and expectation that we will begin shipments to end-user installations by Q4 of this year." 
As a result of recent sales performance, as well as new agreements with resellers in Canada, the US, the UK, and South Africa, Patriot One is now receiving requests to employ special waivers allowing for the immediate deployment of PATSCAN CMR to users that have a demonstrated need under certification exemption guidelines. 
"We have informed our supply chain partners of the accelerating demand, and I am confident that our scalable manufacturing processes will be well equipped to fulfil our orders," says Kandanchatha. "It means a lot of work ahead, but it is a highly positive and not wholly unanticipated situation at this phase of our strategic growth plan."
Martin Cronin, Patriot One CEO, notes, "Proving out demand is a key factor for any early stage company with an exciting new product. The surge we are experiencing reflects the outcomes of repeated successful demonstrations of the system's capability. The word on Patriot One's weapons detection solution is spreading rapidly."
Cronin adds, "All of us at Patriot One Technologies are honoured to have the opportunity to deploy a product with such value as a catalyst for positive change. To have an opportunity to improve public safety and to save lives as a basis for a successful business venture is something we all are very proud of."

    Patriot One Technologies Inc. Announces Closing of Special Warrant Financing 


 






 



















Patriot One Technologies Inc. Announces Closing of Special Warrant Financing 








July 13, 2017





VANCOUVER, BC--(Marketwired - Jul 13, 2017) - Patriot One Technologies Inc. (
  
   TSX VENTURE
  : 
  
   PAT
  ) 
NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO UNITED STATES NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISSEMINATION IN THE UNITED STATES.
Patriot One Technologies Inc. (the "Company") (
  
   TSX VENTURE
  : 
  
   PAT
  ) is pleased to announce that the Special Warrant financing (the "Offering") previously announced on June 14, 2017 has closed today.
Canaccord Genuity Corp. acted as lead agent and sole book runner under the Offering (the "Agent"). The Agent exercised the over-allotment option granted to it by the Company and, along with its syndicate member, Mackie Research Capital Corporation, sold 6,612,500 Special Warrants at a price of $0.70 per Special Warrant for gross proceeds of $4,628,750.
Each Special Warrant not previously exercised will be automatically exercised, without payment of additional consideration, on the earlier of: (i) the Qualification Deadline (as defined below); and (ii) the third business day after the Prospectus Qualification (as defined below). The holders of Special Warrants will receive, upon such automatic exercise, for no additional consideration, one unit of the Company (a "Unit") for each Special Warrant held. Each Unit will be comprised of one common share of the Company and one-half of one common share purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a "Warrant"). Each Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one common share of the Company at an exercise price of $1.25 for a period of 36 months from the date of closing of the Offering. 






The Company has agreed to use its best efforts to obtain a receipt for a final short form prospectus qualifying the distribution of the Units upon exercise of the Special Warrants (the "Prospectus Qualification") on or before the date that is 45 days following closing of the Offering, being August 27, 2017 (the "Qualification Deadline"). If the Prospectus Qualification does not occur before the Qualification Deadline, each holder shall be entitled to receive, without payment of additional consideration, 1.05 Units per Special Warrant. Unless the Prospectus Qualification occurs, securities issued in connection with the Offering will be subject to a four month hold period from the date of issue.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Offering to fund international expansion, accelerate deployment of its technology and for general corporate purposes. Martin Cronin, the Company's CEO, states, "I warmly welcome the closing of this financing and would like to thank our investors for the confidence they have shown in Patriot One. As we move into commercial roll out, we have customers from across the globe eagerly awaiting product. This financing will allow us to continue to execute on our plans to meet that demand."
Further, the Company announces that it revised and refiled its Financial Statements and related MD&A for the quarter ended April 30, 2017. The refiling was necessitated by the engagement of the Company's auditors to perform a review of the financial statements in connection with the Offering. The principle revisions were to remove the Notice of no Auditors Review, update the subsequent event note from June 29, 2017 to July 10, 2017 and to make non-material reclassifications on the balance sheets, statements of shareholders' equity (deficiency) and statement of cash flow. Certain of the reclassifications on the financial statements also required revising in the MD&A. 
This news release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities in the United States. The securities have not been and will not be registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act") or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold within the United States unless registered under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption from such registration is available.
ON BEHALF OF THE BOARD "Martin Cronin" CEO & Director
About Patriot One Technologies, Inc.  The Company has developed PATSCAN CMR™ the next generation of its award-winning Patriot One Technologies™ NForce CMR1000 software and radar solution. PATSCAN CMR is a first-of-its-kind Cognitive Microwave Radar concealed weapons detection system as an effective tool to combat active shooter threats before they occur. Designed for cost-effective deployment in weapon-restricted buildings and facilities, the Patriot One software solution and related hardware can be installed in hallways and doorways to covertly identify weapons and to alert security of an active threat entering the premises. Owner/operators of private and certain public facilities can now prominently post anti-weapons policies with compliance assured. The Company's motto Deter, Detect and Defend is based on the belief that widespread use of its technology will act as an effective deterrent, thereby diminishing the epidemic phenomena of active shooters across the globe. For more information, visit: www.patriot1tech.com. Patriot One Technologies are proud winners of the 2017 Anti-Terrorism / Force Protection category of the Security Industry Association's New Product Showcase at ISC West.
