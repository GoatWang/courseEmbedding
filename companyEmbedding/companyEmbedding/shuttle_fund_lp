 Shuttle Launched











Launched in February 2017 Digital Beta is a high risk fund that will aim to get exposure in a new category of digital assets. These include digital currencies, distributed application tokens, decentralized autonomous organizations, smart contracts, and related assets. 
With the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, decentralized blockchain technologies are redefining the way people and business interact. This marks a paradigm shift towards a singular global economy unencumbered by artificial friction in trade. An attractive investment oportunity exists to capitalize on the disruption, digitization, and disintermediation of centralized services. 
In relation to the size of the opportunity and the rapid growth rates associated with uptake of disruptive technologies, Digital Beta will target annualized returns in excess of 200% per year.





“Blockchains will change everything.”
Goldman Sachs




The fund will be partially activist to ensure growth and adoption of investments.  Longer holding periods will allow access to emergent but currently illiquid investments that provide asymmetric risk return profiles.  Fundamental analysis and due diligence will not only be done in the areas of cybersecurity, finances, governance, and opportunity, but also through code review of technologies where available.  Where applicable, the fund may also provide market making and lending services to provide liquidity and arbitrage market flows.





The Assets





Investment advisory firm needham & co, has calculated that the total retail global market for retail payments will reach $67.5 trillion in 2020 and even if Bitcoin captures a tiny percentage share of this market, that will be a strong catalyst for increasing both the demand for and price of the cryptocurrency. The firm estimates bitcoin is likely to capture 0.28 percent of the retail payments market.
It was noted by Needham & Co. analyst Spencer Bogart that, “…we see value in Bitcoin as a “digital gold” and as a payment network that is enabling a global, open, permissionless financial system… Over the past 20 years alone the United States dollar has lost 53 percent of its value, the British pound has lost 47 percent, the euro has lost 40 percent, and the Australian dollar has lost 64 percent.
Shuttle fund is designed for short term capital appreciation via asset allocation ahead of major inflows and is structured like a positive carry CDS on soverign debt.











“Blockchains are the biggest innovation since the Internet itself.”
Marc Andreesen





Opportunity











Digital β fund strategy includes eclectic investments into meta and digital assets with a fundamental bias. The investment thesis includes front running capital allocation into an emergent asset class that provides a unique hedge against systematic macro-economic risk. This risk is severely mispriced due to experimental and direct monetary policy intervention.
The fund portfolio will be constructed to serve as a cheap call option against a global financial meltdown and should be included in a well diversified portfolio. In the event of a loss of confidence in central banks and national currencies, this portfolio should significantly outperform.
The fund also looks to profit on emergent trend of digitization in areas of capital formation, exchange, and governance. With the gradual progression of society from physical to digital worlds, we expect a positive correlation in the adoption of our portfolio meta and digital assets. 





“I hope to be part of a democratisation that helps put more control & power back in the hands of the everyday citizen”
Richard Branson

Description



The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) is responsible for the archive and distribution of the NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) version SRTM, which includes the global 1 arc second (~30 meter) product.
NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) datasets result from a collaborative effort by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA - previously known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, or NIMA), as well as the participation of the German and Italian space agencies. The purpose of SRTM was to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of the Earth using radar interferometry. SRTM was a primary component of the payload on the Space Shuttle Endeavour during its STS-99 mission. Endeavour launched February 11, 2000 and ﬂew for 11 days.
SRTM collected data in swaths, which extend from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 kilometers (km). These swaths are ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 60° North (N) and 56° South (S) latitude. This accounts for about 80% of Earth’s total landmass.

	Product Quality
Scientists used a method called Kinematic Global Positioning System Geodetic field surveying to validate SRTM data. This method facilitates the very rapid long lines of precise positions from a moving vehicle. Several entities conducted the actual survey work, including private contractors, NGA geodesists, and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) scientists. In all, about 70,000 kilometers of survey lines were collected in support of this mission. The data were used to model long-wavelength error sources.
In addition, NASA’s JPL deployed corner reflectors during the mission. These are highly reflective structures that appear as a bright point in the radar image. These reflectors were deployed with precisely measured coordinates and served as control points in the SRTM data.
Fill value information is included in the .NUM products.

Description



The Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC) is responsible for the archive and distribution of NASA Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) SRTM, which includes the global 3 arc second (~90 meter) product. The 3 arc second data was derived from the 1 arc second using sampling and averaging methods. (See Figure 3 in the NASA SRTM User Guide)
The NASA SRTM data sets result from a collaborative effort by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA - previously known as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency, or NIMA), as well as the participation of the German and Italian space agencies. This collaboration aims to generate a near-global digital elevation model (DEM) of Earth using radar interferometry. SRTM was the primary (and virtually only) payload on the STS-99 mission of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, which launched February 11, 2000 and ﬂew for 11 days.
The SRTM swaths extended from ~30 degrees off-nadir to ~58 degrees off-nadir from an altitude of 233 kilometers (km), creating swaths ~225 km wide, and consisted of all land between 56 degrees south and 60 degrees north latitude to account for 80% of Earth’s total landmass.

Commitment to Action 



Eco Products Fund, L.P.



Commitment by


    Equator Environmental, LLC  





In 2007, Equator and New Forest committed to establish the Eco Products Fund, a $100 million fund for investment in carbon, wetlands, and biodiversity mitigation. The fund is primarily focused on opportunities within United States, but also intends to devote a portion of the capital to international endeavors. The Eco Products Fund has committed over $20 million to forest carbon and wetlands mitigation projects. The fund is aimed at realizing value from illiquid environmental assets such as carbon, water, and biodiversity, and to use innovative financial structures to represent the value of these critical services in the marketplace.

Details

I. Equator Environmental will create a $100 million private equity fund to make investments in wetlands mitigation, endangered species conservation, carbon sequestration, water quality, and other ecosystem-based projects, and to monetize the value of such projects.  All investments will be based on land, forest or vegetation-based projects in North America.
Ecosystems provide many of the services upon which the global economy depends, such as water purification, biodiversity conservation and atmospheric climate regulation.  Globally, approximately 60% of 'ecosystem services' provided by nature are being used unsustainably or are in decline. Over the past twenty years, the amount of developed land has grown by 50% in the United States through increasing population and urbanization, creating pollution, water quality and other environmental problems.  The weight of the economy on the natural infrastructure of the U.S. has led to the pricing of ecosystems services.  Equator Environmental believes that by establishing a fund to invest in projects that preserve and enhance the viability of our ecosystems, we can have a direct impact on the preservation of our ecological assets. Equator also believes that by monetizing such assets through the creation of environmental credits and other 'eco products', we will be able to enhance the market value of our ecosystems, and create further incentives for environmental conservation.
II CGI's tremendous leadership over the past two years on environmental issues has helped inspire Equator Environmental to launch this fund, which is the first of its kind.
Measures of Success: Measures of success may include the growth of nascent markets (carbon, biodiversity, endangered species and water), creation of new financial platforms and instruments for these markets, and a rise in public awareness.
TIMELINE:
Anticipated Launch: December, 2007
First Milestone(s): Invest in at least one of each: terrestrial carbon sequestration project, wetlands mitigation project, endangered species project.
06/30/08:
Participants in this Activity: Members of Equator Environmental, LLC and New Forests Inc.


    Background  

The Eco-Products Fund will be jointly managed by Equator Environmental LLC and New Forests Inc.  Equator and New Forests bring together critical areas of expertise in underlying scientific and technical disciplines and in financial structuring, trading and commercialization of assets. In addition, the partnership creates a one stop shop with strengths in sourcing/origination, transaction management, and distribution.


    Partnership Opportunities  

SEEKING:  implementing partners, best practices information.
OFFERING:  financial resources, implementing partners, best practices information, media and marketing assistance.


Progress Reports

July 2008
The current flagship program of the commitment is the Duck's Unlimited Avoided Grassland Conversion Project in the Prairie Pothole Region.  The goal of the DU Avoided Grassland Conversion project is to protect the Prairie Pothole Region (of North Dakota, South Dakota and Montana) by placing perpetual conservation easements to avoid conversion to cropping. The Project aims to protect 30,000 acres by the end of 2009.
Milestones Reached:
- Currently, over 10,000 acres have been placed under easement or are pending acceptance by the National Fish and Wildlife Service.
- To date, the National Fish and Wildlife Service has never rejected any of Equator Environmental's proposed easements.
