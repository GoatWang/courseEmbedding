NEW YORK, May 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Axoni, a leading provider of distributed ledger technology to the financial services industry, announced today that Citi has joined its Series A funding round, bringing the total amount raised to over $20 million. Citi joins a noteworthy group of Series A investors, including Wells Fargo, NEX Group, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Thomson Reuters., F-Prime Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, DCG, and others.








Axoni and Citi have collaborated on a number of successful, high-profile distributed ledger deployments that have validated the technology and its benefits of data synchronization, automation, and auditability to market participants. Projects to date include the optimization of post-trade data management for credit default swaps and equity swaps, as well as the collaborative management of reference data among industry participants. Citi continues to be actively engaged in various live projects with Axoni, including the replatforming of the DTCC Trade Information Warehouse, which seeks to further streamline, automate, and reduce the cost of derivatives processing across the financial services industry.
Axoni was also recently selected as the provider of distributed ledger technology for post-trade data management in NEX Group's Harmony network, the world's leading connectivity provider for foreign exchange trade data between prime brokers and their clients. 
"Having the support and domain expertise of a world-class institution such as Citi will allow us to execute our vision even more broadly and rapidly - we are delighted to have Citi join Axoni's investor group," said Greg Schvey, CEO of Axoni.

New York, December 22, 2016 — Axoni, a leading provider of distributed ledger technology to the financial services industry, announced today the completion of an $18 million Series A financing round led by Wells Fargo and Euclid Opportunities, ICAP’s fintech investment business, bringing Axoni’s total funding to date above $20 million. The financing round also included participation from Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Thomson Reuters, Andreessen Horowitz, FinTech Collective, F-Prime Capital Partners, and Digital Currency Group.
Axoni has established itself as a leader in distributed ledger technology for the financial services industry through a variety of successful, high-profile deployments, including the optimization of post-trade data management for credit default swaps, equity swaps, and foreign exchange derivatives, implemented in partnership with more than a dozen global banks and financial infrastructure providers. These customer use cases further validate how distributed ledger technology has the potential to streamline multi-party workflows, reduce reconciliation costs, and provide greater transparency to financial markets.
“We are delighted to have strategic support from global leaders in financial services,” said Greg Schvey, CEO of Axoni. “The changes already underway based on distributed ledger technology will have a profoundly positive impact on the industry. Axoni is excited to help drive that progress alongside our investors and clients.”
“Axoni has developed proprietary Smart Contract technology and has successfully validated this technology in a variety of Capital Markets use cases. We have been impressed by the high-caliber team, their deep domain knowledge, and disciplined approach to product development. We are delighted to support Axoni in the next phase of their development,” said C. Thomas Richardson, Head of Market Structure and Electronic Trading Services at Wells Fargo Securities.
“Since we started working with Axoni over a year ago, we’ve been impressed with their knowledge of financial services, as well as their expertise with how distributed ledger technology can intersect with other evolving technologies. They have quietly built their credibility with key financial players and have emerged as one of the leaders in this rapidly evolving space,” said Richard Kerschner, Chief Corporate Development Officer for ICAP Post Trade, Risk and Information Services.
Legal representation for Axoni related to the financing included Buhler Duggal & Henry LLP, as well as Latham and Watkins, LLP.
