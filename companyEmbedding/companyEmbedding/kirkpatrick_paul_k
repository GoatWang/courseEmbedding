 Simons Fellow, Visiting Associate Professor of Mathematics at MIT 
 Blackwell Scholar in Mathematics,  Associate Professor of
Mathematics and Physics

E-mail:  kkirkpat (at) illinois (dot) edu



 Jing Wang and
Partha Dey
 are now
organizing the probability
seminar.



Research Interests: quantum and statistical mechanics,
  information theory, and machine learning.

Here's a general 
  description of some of my results and aims.
Specifically, I'm interested in: 
  
 Quantum groups as models of freely independent random
  variables, especially in non-tracial von Neumann algebras.

 Quantum statistical mechanics models: 
    Bose-Einstein condensation and nonlinear Schrödinger
  equations (NLS), discrete NLS and other lattice systems with noise or long-range interactions, and fractional NLS models of energy transport in biopolymers like DNA. Terry
  Tao's blog entry about some of my BEC work.
 Classical statistical mechanics: soft-sphere models of plasmas, and the Landau equation in the weak coupling limit. 
 Computational probability, algorithms, and family genetic data
    analysis.
     Spin
  models of ferromagnets and superconductors: Heisenberg
  model, XY model,
    coupled XY models, Toy Higgs model, other O(N) models, and connections with
  macroscopic equations for magnets and superconductors, especially
  critical behavior.
   What's new: Turing, von Neumann, Shannon, and Hopper; foundations of
    computer science, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence.

Other Interests

  I've mentored Illinois
 Geometry Lab projects on percolation
 theory with Michelle Delcourt and Thomas Mahoney, and a
 project on phase transitions in XY models with Tayyab Nawaz.
 

My NSF CAREER Award has been providing partial support for Urbana's
Kovalevsky Days.
