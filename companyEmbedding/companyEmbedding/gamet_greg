As walls go, Greg Gamet’s is a monster.
It cost Gamet and his partners —  owners of the Dank Colorado marijuana store in Denver —  about $80,000 in renovations to put up. There were extra permits and inspections involved. And it all had to be done on a rushed schedule so that Dank Colorado could be among the nation’s first licensed recreational marijuana stores to open Jan. 1.
But Gamet said the ordeal was worth it because the wall keeps separate the two hemispheres of his shop’s world: the recreational marijuana side and the medical marijuana side.
“The product is similar,” Gamet said, “but other than that, they’re two completely different businesses.”
Given the costs and headaches, though, it’s little wonder that most shops aren’t following Dank’s lead.
Almost all of the medical marijuana businesses in Colorado that have applied to open recreational shops chose to hang on to their medical sides, as well. Only four out of the 171  stores that have either applied to open or are already licensed by the state for recreational sales made a full conversion, according to state figures.
Those stores that kept both recreational and medical marijuana sides faced a problem. Recreational pot shops can sell only to people 21 and over. But medical marijuana dispensaries can  serve younger customers. If a store wants to keep selling to under-21 medical marijuana patients, state law requires it to build a wall between the two sides and give them separate entrances. 
In Denver, businesses that do so are known as “co-located” stores, and they make up the minority of shops that have applied with the city for recreational sales. Only 28 of the 117   stores that have applied in Denver intend to build a wall, according to the city.
The other 89 are what the city calls “co-terminus” stores,  meaning they sell both medical and recreational marijuana in the same space and all customers — including medical marijuana patients — have to be at least  21.


 Industry advocates say stores putting up walls are finding it difficult. The construction costs, as well as the added permits and inspections, complicate what Mike Elliott, the executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, said is already a complicated process.   
“It’s already challenging enough to open the business for recreational sales without doing that,” he said.
What the walls buy for the stores is the ability to serve a tiny slice of Colorado’s medical marijuana market. Less than 5 percent of Colorado’s medical marijuana patients are under 21, according to state Health Department statistics. The average age of the state’s roughly 110,000 medical marijuana patients is 42.
But Gamet said the wall keeps the culture of the different businesses separate, too. While the recreational side of Dank Colorado has seen heavy traffic and quick turnaround, Gamet said customers on the medical side generally prefer to take their time when making purchases and discuss the properties of different marijuana strains.
“It’s more of an intimate environment,” he said. “We built our business on medical marijuana. So for us to be able to service our medical patients effectively, they needed a separate entrance.”

The publication also stated, "Running a successful cannabis business requires many talents… however, nothing will get you past the starting gate if your business isn't compliant with the myriad of state and local regulations.

Kush Bottles Appoints Greg Gamet to Board of Directors

Well-known leader in cannabis industry provides expertise, insight, and connections




May 18, 2015, 10:50am EDT














LOS ANGELES, May 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Kush Bottles, North America's premier supplier of customizable child-resistant packaging solutions and accessories for the marijuana industry, announced today that they have elected Greg Gamet to the company's Board of Directors. 
Kush Bottles recently acquired Dank Bottles, LLC, which was co-founded by Gamet.
Gamet is one of the cannabis industry's leading executives, and his accomplishments are without par.

His dispensary group, DANK, was operating on the medical side of the cannabis industry since Sept of 2009; was one of the first to obtain and open a marijuana retail store in Colorado under the "Adult-Use/Recreational" licensure; and made the first recreational sale in the state on January 1, 2014. 
He co-owns one of the most successful cannabis retail stores in the nation. 
He co-founded the largest packaging and accessory distributorship in the state. 
He co-founded a cannabis consulting business, which has resulted in licenses being granted in several states. 
He is experienced in business financing and raising capital. 
He knows how to build and grow sustainable businesses.
Gamet also understands the complex regulations that govern both medical and recreational marijuana, and has deep insight into compliance issues – a vitally important skillset as new markets open nationwide.
"Greg's knowledge and expertise make him a valuable addition to our board," said Nicholas Kovacevich, Co-Founder and CEO of Kush Bottles, Inc. "He helped build our Kush Bottles Colorado operation into a thriving business, and we are confident that his industry experience and vision for the future will provide great value to our company and to our shareholders."
"I am happy to be joining the board at Kush Bottles," Gamet stated. "I believe that the company can continue to grow within their core business, while expanding into new areas," he added. "I look forward to being part of this company, and helping it become one of the dominant businesses in the cannabis industry."
For more information on Kush Bottles, call: (888)-920-5874, or visit the website at: www.kushbottles.com.

Kush Bottles, a North American supplier of customizable child-resistant packaging solutions and accessories for the marijuana industry, on Tuesday announced that they have acquired Dank Bottles, LLC, dba Kush Bottles Colorado.

"Through this acquisition, we are able to fully integrate the Dank Bottles team and resources into our company, including their warehouse and extensive distribution network."
Ben Wu, president of Kush Bottles, said the real winners will be the company's customers. "We are now the only cannabis packaging company with full service distribution centers in the three largest marijuana markets: California, Colorado and Washington," he said.

Q & A With Denver Consulting Group’s Greg Gamet  Denver Consulting Group



  


































































 







 COLORADO'S CANNABIS EXPERTS           






















Q & A With Denver Consulting Group’s Greg Gamet  











  23 Apr, 2017 
                
 Randall Huft 
 Cannabis Consulting Blog 


Almost twenty years ago, Greg Gamet, now 44, drove to Colorado from in Iowa in his beat-up Cadillac to join a rock ’n roll band with Justin Jones, with whom he now co-owns Denver Consulting Group. While their love for music was strong, the pair knew they needed to earn extra money.
Cannabis was all the rage in Colorado, so in 2009 they opened Dank Colorado, a licensed medical dispensary and grow operation. As the business continued to grow and earn a reputation as a customer-centric store, they added staff. Jay Griffin became one of the company’s first employees, and Bryan Sullivan came on as an investor/partner in 2010. Dan Glenn joined the now-thriving business in 2014. The dispensary became one of the first recreational stores in Colorado.
“In the years we’ve been running a grow operation and dispensary, we really learned the ropes, perils, and pitfalls,” said Gamet. “So, we started the Denver Consulting Group to help entrepreneurs start and run a successful cannabis businesses.”
To date, Denver Consulting Group has assissted cannabis businesses in almost every state. From application and license support to compliance and packaging, budtender training, and human resources issues, Denver Consulting Group has assembled a team of the industry’s top experts from all sectors to provide comprehensive A-to-Z services.
So now, here is some interesting Q & A With Denver Consulting Group’s Greg Gamet:
What states are you most bullish on when it comes to opening new dispensaries?
We are especially bullish on Massachusetts and believe that, once a few challenges can be overcome, the state could become the second largest market in the nation [behind California]. The state’s proximity to major population centers, and the fact that New York’s program is too narrow, means Massachusetts could become a hub for legal cannabis for the entire Eastern Seaboard.
Gamet’s Law
Dispensary location is not as important as it is in other retail operations. If you build a great business and do everything right, [dispensaries] can sometimes be located in an out-of-the-way location. If you build it correctly, they will come.
DCG created the Standard Operating Procedures Manual. Tell us about it.
This book helps guide businesses and establishes protocols to protect workers, customers, and the company’s license. Additionally, virtually every issue that can be imagined is planned for and steps are outlined to correct any problem. This is extraordinarily valuable, because the time to make decisions is under calm deliberation, not stress and havoc. Our SOP Manual is customized for each business and provides them with a roadmap for operational success.
When it comes to branding and marketing what advice do you give clients?
We believe that branding, marketing, and public relations is key to the success of any cannabis business. We work exclusively with Randall Huft at the Innovation Agency and recommend him to our clients. He knows the industry and has helped many cannabis companies go from start-up to leaders in their sector.
What is DCG currently working on?
We are working on an exciting project in California which will become the largest grow operation in the nation. Details are still under wraps, but this is not only the biggest project we’ve ever worked on, it’s also literally the biggest project in the entire cannabis industry to date.
What traits do you look for when hiring a general manager or budtender?
We look for personal traits more than experience. You can train someone to do a job. You can’t train someone to be friendly, compassionate, understanding, and have a genuine desire to help others. Those are the traits we look for in any new hire.
What’s the best way for a dispensary to grow their customer base in a crowded market?
Market your business! You need to be listed on the appropriate websites and garner excellent customer reviews. Moreover, you need to create a brand identity: What do you stand for as a company? Are you a low-cost provider, or more of an exclusive store? There are many components to launching a brand, which is why we work with experts in marketing, advertising, and public relations. Of course, it’s vital to have a great product mix and personable, well-trained employees.
What are some of the reasons one dispensary is profitable and another is not?
We have helped many dispensaries become profitable when they were struggling to stay open. We find that usually the factors are one or more of the items I mentioned above: A failure to brand, market and advertise; a failure to train employees; a failure to have a great selection of products. Interestingly, location is not as important as it is in other retail operations. If you build a great business, and do everything right, [dispensaries] can sometimes be located in an out-of-the-way location. If you build it correctly, they will come.
Mistake Busters
According to DCG, the three biggest mistakes dispensaries make are…

Not having enough inventory on hand to meet customer demand.


Not managing cash flow, and therefore being unable to purchase adequate inventory while making payroll.


Not paying enough attention to compliance. “We are in a tightly regulated industry, and the slightest infraction can cost a dispensary owner large fines or even license suspension or revocation,” Gamet said.

Q & A With Denver Consulting Group’s Greg Gamet

By Rob Hill -   April 4, 2017 





Almost twenty years ago, Greg Gamet, now 44, drove to Colorado from in Iowa in his beat-up Cadillac to join a rock ’n roll band with Justin Jones, with whom he now co-owns Denver Consulting Group. While their love for music was strong, the pair knew they needed to earn extra money. Cannabis was all the rage in Colorado, so in 2009 they opened Dank Colorado, a licensed medical dispensary and grow operation. As the business continued to grow and earn a reputation as a customer-centric store, they added staff. Jay Griffin became one of the company’s first employees, and Bryan Sullivan came on as an investor/partner in 2010. Dan Glenn joined the now-thriving business in 2014. The dispensary became one of the first recreational stores in Colorado.
“In the years we’ve been running a grow operation and dispensary, we really learned the ropes, perils, and pitfalls,” said Gamet. “So, we started the Denver Consulting Group to help entrepreneurs start and run a successful cannabis businesses.”
To date, Denver Consulting Group has assissted cannabis businesses in almost every state. From application and license support to compliance and packaging, budtender training, and human resources issues, Denver Consulting Group has assembled a team of the industry’s top experts from all sectors to provide comprehensive A-to-Z services.
What states are you most bullish on when it comes to opening new dispensaries?
We are especially bullish on Massachusetts and believe that, once a few challenges can be overcome, the state could become the second largest market in the nation [behind California]. The state’s proximity to major population centers, and the fact that New York’s program is too narrow, means Massachusetts could become a hub for legal cannabis for the entire Eastern Seaboard.
Gamet’s Law
Dispensary location is not as important as it is in other retail operations. If you build a great business and do everything right, [dispensaries] can sometimes be located in an out-of-the-way location. If you build it correctly, they will come.
DCG created the Standard Operating Procedures Manual. Tell us about it.
This book helps guide businesses and establishes protocols to protect workers, customers, and the company’s license. Additionally, virtually every issue that can be imagined is planned for and steps are outlined to correct any problem. This is extraordinarily valuable, because the time to make decisions is under calm deliberation, not stress and havoc. Our SOP Manual is customized for each business and provides them with a roadmap for operational success.
When it comes to branding and marketing what advice do you give clients?
We believe that branding, marketing, and public relations is key to the success of any cannabis business. We work exclusively with Randall Huft at the Innovation Agency and recommend him to our clients. He knows the industry and has helped many cannabis companies go from start-up to leaders in their sector.
What is DCG currently working on?
We are working on an exciting project in California which will become the largest grow operation in the nation. Details are still under wraps, but this is not only the biggest project we’ve ever worked on, it’s also literally the biggest project in the entire cannabis industry to date.
What traits do you look for when hiring a general manager or budtender?
We look for personal traits more than experience. You can train someone to do a job. You can’t train someone to be friendly, compassionate, understanding, and have a genuine desire to help others. Those are the traits we look for in any new hire.
What’s the best way for a dispensary to grow their customer base in a crowded market?
Market your business! You need to be listed on the appropriate websites and garner excellent customer reviews. Moreover, you need to create a brand identity: What do you stand for as a company? Are you a low-cost provider, or more of an exclusive store? There are many components to launching a brand, which is why we work with experts in marketing, advertising, and public relations. Of course, it’s vital to have a great product mix and personable, well-trained employees.
What are some of the reasons one dispensary is profitable and another is not?
We have helped many dispensaries become profitable when they were struggling to stay open. We find that usually the factors are one or more of the items I mentioned above: A failure to brand, market and advertise; a failure to train employees; a failure to have a great selection of products. Interestingly, location is not as important as it is in other retail operations. If you build a great business, and do everything right, [dispensaries] can sometimes be located in an out-of-the-way location. If you build it correctly, they will come.
Mistake Busters
According to DCG, the three biggest mistakes dispensaries make are…

Not having enough inventory on hand to meet customer demand.


Not managing cash flow, and therefore being unable to purchase adequate inventory while making payroll.


Not paying enough attention to compliance. “We are in a tightly regulated industry, and the slightest infraction can cost a dispensary owner large fines or even license suspension or revocation,” Gamet said.
