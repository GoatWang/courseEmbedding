This is the hardcover version of a tale told in documents tracing the Crowell/Ploof descent from 70 families immigrating to New England between about 1620 and 1640. By late nineteenth century, descendants of all of those families had married into the core line begun by John Crowe/Crowell, who arrived in New England in 1634. Among those 70 families are Stephen Hopkins of the Mayflower, as well as Oliver Mainwaring and Anne Marbury Hutchinson, both with proven descents from Charlemagne and William the Conqueror. We recount the westward movement of the Crowe/Crowell line through 12 generations spanning 400 years, through Charles Crowell and Susan Ploof, to Americans alive today. Click the preview link for a sample family sketch and a list of the included families, maps, and documents (wills, obituaries, deeds). 496 pages, fully indexed; extensive photography; 1288 footnotes and source references.  Also available in softcover.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions.
