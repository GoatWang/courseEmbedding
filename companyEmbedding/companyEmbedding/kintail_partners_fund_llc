About Us


Patriarch Partners, LLC, is a family office/private investment firm. Since 2000, through affiliated investment funds, Lynn Tilton has held ownership in and restructured more than 240 companies with combined revenues in excess of $100 billion, representing more than 700,000 jobs. Patriarch focuses on the acquisition and invigoration of undervalued iconic American brands where time, capital and sound strategy can rescue a business and restore value, creating and preserving jobs in America and across the globe.
The firm is devoted to rebuilding America one company at a time, one job at a time. Current investments include Dura Automotive, Performance Designed Products, Universal Instruments, Spiegel Catalogs, MD Helicopters, Rand McNally, and Stila Cosmetics. Tilton’s platform is one of the largest woman-owned businesses in the country.






At Our Core


Founded by Lynn Tilton in 2000, Patriarch was built upon a proprietary patented financial model designed to manage and monetize the distressed portfolios of financial institutions. From 2000 through March 2016 Patriarch and its affiliates served as the collateral managers for 13 investment funds, a number of which were recognized as the most successful of their kind. In order to spend more time with her operating companies and to better drive innovation across the platform, Ms. Tilton and Patriarch chose to step aside from managing outside funds to focus fully on creating value and monetizing investments.
The firm’s belief system and strategy in value investing does not waver or change with market fluctuations. It takes time, stability, liquidity and an appropriate capital structure to rebuild businesses. Challenging conditions often mean the need to improve operations from the ground up; the situations require equal concentration and adeptness between financial engineering and operational execution.







StrategyPatriarch excels in formulating strategies that rebuild and rebrand iconic American companies and demonstrates a deep understanding for the opportunities that arise in times of adversity and in transformational markets. Patriarch develops a long-term vision for each of its portfolio companies and the synergies that can be advanced among them, with the instinctive ability to recognize the tactical steps necessary to implement an operational turnaround that builds both revenue and value.




Operational ExpertiseA proactive partner during periods of operational, industrial and economic change, Patriarch is vertically integrated to rebuild and create value at the enterprise level. It is more than oversight – Patriarch has a wealth of leaders who effectively manage change, build value and who generate additional platform efficiencies through in-house talent acquisition, legal, technology and design innovation, marketing and communications , insurance, and supply chain management.




CapitalA pioneer in developing creative financial and structured models, Patriarch has designed intellectual property and databases, including those with U.S. patents, which help stabilize turnaround situations and enhance liquidity with innovative solutions in Credit, Finance, Structured Finance and Treasury, Loan Operations and Mergers & Acquisitions.





“There is only one way to keep manufacturing jobs in America. If we sell it in America, we must make it in America”
