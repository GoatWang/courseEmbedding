The selling stockholders are selling shares of common stock covered by this 
prospectus for their own account. We will not receive any portion of the 
proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the shares of common stock 
covered hereby, or interests therein, by the selling stockholders.

We have agreed to bear the expenses of the registration of the shares. We 
anticipate that these expenses will be approximately $72,000.


In Asia, the funeral home and cemetery industry is characterized by a large 
number of locally-owned, independent operations. To compete successfully, our 
funeral service locations and cemeteries must maintain good reputations and 
high professional standards, as well as offer attractive services at 
competitive prices. In addition, we must market the Company in such a manner 
as to distinguish us from our competitors. If we are unable to successfully 
compete, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could 
be materially adversely affected.


Company Description
We are a development stage company actively pursing a business plan. The Company
and its affiliates have no plans or intentions to engage in a merger or 
acquisition with an unidentified company or person, once it is a reporting 
company, to be used as a vehicle for a private company to become a


 reporting 
company. All of our executive officers work full time on this business. We have 
not yet generated any revenue from our operations. We currently have no assets 
and have incurred losses since our inception. We plan to sell death care 
management consulting services through Longbau Hong Kong, our operating 
subsidiary, in Hong Kong, to public consumers across Hong Kong, and we intend 
to expand business operations by providing funeral consultation and funeral 
service management.

We plan to provide funeral consultation and funeral service management. These 
services would include advising on cemetery property, funeral and cemetery 
merchandise and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis. In 
addition, the Company will specialize in the consultation for deferred preneed 
funeral and cemetery receipts held in trust, preneed cemetery activities, 
preneed funeral activities, preneed funeral and cemetery, burial vaults, 
cemetery property, and cemetery property revenue.

Currently, and for the duration of 2014, the Company is actively pursuing 
entering constantly contracts with small death care service providers in Hong 
Kong. In 2015 the Company plans to expand its scope of clients to include 
median and large enterprises.

---

We presently maintain our executive office at 15/B—15/F Cheuk Nang Plaza 250 
Hennessy Road, Hong Kong. Our telephone number is +852 58059452.

展开+3龍寶集團-Longbau Group Inc. · 2014年12月3日 · 【闡述遺體美容的重要性】 隨著人類現代文明的發展，殯葬從業人員在執業過程，其社會服務已延伸涵蓋公共衛生及悲傷輔導的領域意義，之所以如此演變，源於傳統觀念民間一般都有全屍的觀念，故而對非自然死亡者，屍首殘缺不全的，在家屬心中必會留下永恆難以消滅的痛楚，因此，業者基於悲天之心，盡可能的讓死者保有全屍，因此遺體處理的技術的確是現代社會所需求。以從業人員的角度而言，遺體修復除了是留給家屬完美的記憶影像之外，應該還包括對遺體的崇敬。綜上，從業人員其相關教育的素養不容漠視。 由於台灣昔日是農業社會，對親人亡故至今依舊保有守靈的習慣，物換星移使部分習俗已從善如流簡化改變，所以家屬已經習慣葬儀社人員抬走親人的遺體，徒留悲傷與恐懼。從遺體進入殯儀館到大殮的匆匆一別，遺體是否被妥善照料一無所知，鋪設豪華奢侈的排場，難道就是表達對亡者的敬重與追思最好的方式？因此，藉由遺體美容技術，將面無血色或支離破碎的大體修復完整，在經由美容化妝技術恢復生前模樣，營造出安詳沉睡的容貌，免於家屬面對狀態不佳的大體，也讓觀禮者不再以恐懼的面紗來看待大體；並，其過程以亡者為主角，從遺體照料...，遺體關懷，遺體陪伴為出發，讓亡者得到應有的尊嚴與權益，得以有完整肅穆的遺容來告別親屬。 走筆至此，我們發現一個人的思維是會改變自己的觀念行為，所謂備其哀榮，希望哀在家屬，化哀傷為對遺體的陪伴與關懷。榮呢？榮在於使亡者得到應有的權益與對待，足見遺體美容在喪葬的過程中產生社會與心理的正面功能，且每個人以及家庭終究會對此行業有所需求，確立了遺體美容的意義與價值。 文末，我們從今年爆發流行的伊波拉病毒，來探討這門學問在視死猶生，悲傷輔導的貢獻外，公共衛生的社會貢獻更是位居關鍵地位。以伊波拉疫區為例，遺體防護人員身處防疫第一線，往往也是高風險群的一群人，不僅職業傷害風險高，稍有不慎更可能成為傳播窗口，在病毒疫苗研發期間至可量產之前，人類面對病毒肆虐只能挨打而束手無策；但近日數篇來自世界衛生組織(WHO)的國際報導我們發現，大凡以嚴密的遺體防護程序處理高傳染性遺體，其數據顯示，竟然可以大幅降低伊波拉病毒在該地區的感染率，透過嚴謹的遺體防護程序創造卓越的防疫成效，已經屢屢得到國際高度重視。 學生謹以此文向遺體美容從業人員致敬 仁德醫專生觀科一年級一班萬柏暉 10367019. 展开龍寶集團-Longbau Group Inc. · 2014年11月12日 · 人的生命並非固定的，一旦死亡，也非幻滅，它仍會生生不息，如晝夜之相續，無始無終。 唯現代人迷惘於生死的漩渦中，往往不尊重自我的生命，正因為我們的生死教育是忽略和逃避，使少數人無法以健全的態度看待生前殯葬契約的文明意涵；所以，如何落實生死教育並往下扎根，的確是國內教育與產業應該好好省思的重要課題。 龍寶生命科技的企業使命，就是讓國人敞開心胸面對生命的豁達，珍惜自我與家人的人生！根據經建會2010年8月完成的最新人口推估，台灣人口將從2022年開始零成長，2023年開始負成長。故，隨人口老化，2027年(13年後)開始，每兩個人就要扶養一個老幼人口，逐漸走向轉型的人口結構，值得你好好省思「生命管理」日趨重要，高齡化的社會，應有未雨綢繆的身後計畫，指導國人如何不忌諱，做自己生命的主人外，這個大趨勢也明確指出龍寶產業的未來價值：引導人們適應即將到來的社會轉型，使之活得有尊嚴，死亡時也能有尊嚴，進而協助相同理念者，輔導二度就業，再造第二春！故吾人宣導生前預立契約之重要。... 「人生皆有盡頭，只是快慢之分，無須哭泣，但要懂得堅強，獨立。」 【龍寶生命科技】 展开龍寶集團-Longbau Group Inc. · 2014年11月6日 · 許多人對於傳統喪禮繁瑣的禮儀儀節、習俗和禁忌等，經常感到茫然無奈，他們不禁想問，在這個多元的台灣社會裡，為什麼已經有不少人突破傳統，不拘泥於忌諱，而用自己的態度和世界說再見！ 生活中有預購車票、預訂餐廳、預約掛號、預立遺囑...等，隨著社會大眾對生命和死亡態度的認識和轉變，今人也開始思考自己的身後事，不想受傳統束縛，不願任人擺佈，對自己的身後事要求自主權。 我們殯葬業在實務經驗中，許多喪家經常為了喪禮的物品、內容、甚或宗教儀式，彼此發生很大爭執。或是喪家對葬儀社(喪禮的安排)有很大的歧見。或是喪家對於禮儀社人員只為想賺錢，經常以「以前都是這麼做」、「這是你XX最後的一條花費，要捨得！」，既忌諱，又鬧得雙方不愉快。... 當這些爭執、歧見或不愉快發生的時候，喪家經常都會想要詢問：當事人（亡者）自己的想法是什麼？可惜亡者已不會說話了！ 為了避免這些無謂衝突的發生，「預約喪禮」是最好的做法！「預約喪禮」其實就是「殯葬預囑」的觀念，也就是在生前將自己的後事明白清楚的告知親人，並和親人溝通達成共識；「殯葬預囑」和預立遺囑都是同樣的意義，都是透過預囑的方式，能讓親人很清楚的知道該怎麼辦、如何辦。而不致使親屬們意見分歧，甚至不合。 【龍寶事業機構/中二區】 展开龍寶集團-Longbau Group Inc. · 2014年10月7日 · 【上海龍寶開業酒會】 從2014年3月開始，上海龍寶企業發展有限公司正式開始投入運作，經過半年時間的準備策劃，終於在9月19日這一天，在上海建國賓館迎來了正式向外宣佈開業的慶典儀式。 隨著中國社會日益老齡化的逐步形成，如何贍養老人，傳承孝道，注重傳統禮儀，同時體現公民的獨立性和個體化，也越發顯得重要而必要。在這樣的社會背景下，再加上將近一年的國內外市場考察，上海龍寶企業發展有限公司引進了始於歐洲的生命禮儀概念，再加上龍寶集團的投資和其專業團隊的指導，將生命禮儀作為公司發展的主要業務、主要傳承和創新對象，這將填補彼岸在這一傳統行業上的一大空白。... 上海龍寶同樣引進了在台灣和日本都發展卓越的生前契約。生前契約不僅僅是一份理財產品，也同樣是一份獨特的生命保險保單。酒會現場，很多與會貴賓都簽購了生前契約。 作為台灣龍寶的主要股東之一，墨石資本CEO張義發先生應邀參加了開業酒會，和龍寶集團總裁柯在先生、上海龍寶總經理趙海峰先生、智明星通科技有限公司首席執行官唐彬森先生一起開啟了上海龍寶的冰雕塑像，見證了上海龍寶的成立。 展开龍寶集團-Longbau Group Inc. · 2014年9月27日 · 原著已經出版好一段時間了，沒想到竟然拍成電影了！遺體 -朝向明日的十天 預告片youtube.com龍寶集團-Longbau Group Inc. · 2014年9月22日 · 荷蘭有ㄧ間小型喪禮公司(DEL'A)佛心來著、將許多民眾想對過世親人說的話錄下來製成廣告，被認為是感人肺腑的感動行銷。 DEL'A發現大多數人失去親人之後，最大的遺憾往往是沒有花時間與家人、至愛共處。『如果還想對他說ㄧ句話，你會說什麼？那麼為何現在不說呢？』於是，D決定給大家ㄧ個機會對自己的親人、朋友致詞，申請者可以挑選地方，工作人員會配合攝影，給他ㄧ個麥克風，在他們面前說出想要說的，不再留有遺憾。 D再將這些故事製作成電視廣告、記錄片和。據暸解，該公司還因此業務上升了50%... 【龍寶事業機構/中二區】 展开WHY WAIT UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE - Cannes Lions Grand Prix Media LionsWHY WAIT UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE?

	CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
	INFORMATION



	 


	This report contains forward-looking statements.
	These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance
	or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievement expressed or implied by the forward-looking
	statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors described under Part 1 Item 2 “Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
	statements by terms such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” “estimates,” “expects,”
	“intends,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “predicts,” “projects,”
	“should,” “would” and similar expressions intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
	statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and subject to risks and uncertainties.
	Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.


	 


	Forward-looking statements represent our
	estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. You should read this report and the documents that we reference in
	this report, or that we filed as exhibits to this report completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may
	be materially different from what we expect.


	 


	Except as required by law, we assume no
	obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from
	those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.


	 



	OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION



	 


	References in this report to “we,”
	“us,” “our” and the “Company” and words of like import refer to Longbau Group, Inc. and its
	subsidiaries.


	 


	Our business is conducted in Hong Kong
	using the Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), the currency of Hong Kong, in Taiwan using NT$, the currency of Taiwan, and our financial statements
	are presented in United States dollars (“USD” or “$”).   In this report, we refer to assets,
	obligations, commitments and liabilities in our financial statements in USD.   These dollar references are based on the
	exchange rate of NT$ to USD, determined as of a specific date.   Changes in the exchange rate will affect the amount
	of our obligations and the value of our assets in terms of USD which may result in an increase or decrease in the amount of our
	obligations (expressed in USD) and the value of our assets, including accounts receivable (expressed in USD).

	Longbau Group, Inc.






	Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements




	For the Three Months Ended March 31,
	2017 and 2016




	(Unaudited)




	 




	Note 1 - Organization and Basis of Presentation



	 



	Organization and Line of Business



	 


	Longbau Group, Inc. (the “Company”)
	was incorporated in the State of Delaware on December 23, 2013. The Company owns 100% of Longbau Group Limited, which
	was incorporated in Hong Kong on February 14, 2014. The Company is focusing its business on consultancy for deferred preneed funeral
	and cemetery receipts held in trust, preneed cemetery and funeral activities, burial vaults, cemetery property, and cemetery property
	revenue.


	 


	In September 2014, the Company established
	Longbau Management Consulting LLC in Taiwan (“Longbau Taiwan”) to provide end-of-life consulting services and sell
	end-of-life products in Taiwan. Longbau Taiwan is 100% owned by Longbau Group Limited. In 2015, the Company started to sell supplies
	for funerals and plans to provide additional funeral services for the Taiwanese market.


	 


	On December 29,
	2016, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with the shareholders of Long Bao Life Technology Co., Ltd (“Long
	Bao Life”), and Tsai Ko, the Company’s CEO. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company issued 250,000 shares of its common
	stock to the shareholders of Long Bao Life in exchange for 100% of Long Bao Life's issued and outstanding ownership interests.
	Upon completion of the foregoing transaction, Long Bao Life became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Long Bao Life was
	a private company incorporated in Taiwan in 2007.


	 


	Long Bao Life provides “pre-need”
	and “at need” funeral services and sells funeral related products, such as urns, in Taiwan. A pre-need death care contract
	enables a customer to make his/her own funeral arrangements in advance and prepay for the funeral, which reduces the burden of
	the family at the time of bereavement as well as avoids the influence of rising costs. In addition, the Company provides consulting
	services to customers prior to the purchase. Long Bao Life utilizes various systems, including multi-level marketing ("MLM")
	system, to sell the preneed contracts and other products. Under the MLM system, the salespeople are compensated not only for sales
	they generate, but also for the sales of the other salespeople that they recruit. This recruited sales force is referred to as
	the participant's "downline", and can provide multiple levels of compensation. MLM is one type of direct selling. The
	salespeople are expected to sell products directly to consumers by means of relationship referrals and word of mouth marketing.
	MLM salespeople not only sell the Long Bao Life products but also encourage others to join Long Bao Life as a distributor. Long
	Bao Life also sells its preneed contracts and other products through agents where it pays a fixed amount of commission.


	 


	On December 29,
	2016, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with the shareholders of Ho-Cheng Insurance Brokers Co., Ltd. (“Ho-Cheng
	Insurance”) and Tsai Ko, the Company’s CEO. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company issued 250,000 shares of its common
	stock to shareholders of Ho-Cheng Insurance in exchange for 100% of Ho-Cheng Insurance’s issued and outstanding ownership
	interests. Upon completion of the foregoing transaction, Ho-Cheng Insurance became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Ho-Cheng
	Insurance was a private company incorporated in Taiwan in 2001.


	 


	Ho-Cheng Insurance,
	an insurance intermediary company, focuses on sales of life, property and casualty insurance products underwritten by insurance
	companies as well as insurance brokerage services. Ho-Cheng Insurance has been cooperating with many insurance companies operating
	in Taiwan to distribute a wide variety of insurance products to customers.


	 


	Tsai Ko, the Company’s
	Chief Executive Officer, Director and a majority shareholder of the Company, was (i) the Chief Executive Officer of Long Bao Life
	and owner of 12% of Long Bao Life’s ownership interests; and (ii) owner of 25% of Ho-Cheng Insurance’s ownership interests.


	 


	Yueh-Kuei Ko,
	the Company’s Chief Financial Officer, Director, and owner of 5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock was (i)
	a Long Bao Life Director and 18% owner of Long Bao Life’s ownership’s interests and (ii) the Chief Executive Officer
	of Ho-Cheng Insurance and a 25% owner of Ho-Cheng Insurance’s ownership interests.


	 


	Tsai Ko, Yueh-Kuei Ko and relatives of
	each collectively owned a majority interest in both Long Bao Life and Ho-Cheng Insurance.


	 



	Interim financial statements



	 


	The unaudited interim financial statements
	included herein, presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
	GAAP”), have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
	Commission (“SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared
	in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations,
	although the Company believes that the disclosure are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.


	 



	Going concern



	 


	The accompanying unaudited consolidated
	financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
	of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had a negative working capital at March 31, 2017 and had net cash
	outflow for operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for the
	Company to continue as a going concern. The Company's management plans to borrow additional funds from related parties as needed.
	However, there is no obligation by these related parties to provide such funding. The Company's ability to continue as a going
	concern is dependent on these additional cash financings, and, ultimately, upon achieving profitable operations.


	 






	 



	7



	 







	 




	 


	These financial statements reflect all adjustment, consisting
	of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained
	therein. It is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company
	for the year ended December 31, 2016 and notes thereto included in the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K. The Company
	follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim report. Results of operations for the interim period are not
	indicative of annual results.


	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. The Company’s functional currency is the Taiwanese Dollar (“Taiwan
	$” or “NT$”); however, the accompanying consolidated financial statements were translated and presented in United
	States Dollars (“$” or “USD”). The Company, Long Bao Life and Ho-Cheng were entities under common control
	and had been since the earliest period presented in these consolidated financial statements; therefore, the accompanying consolidated
	financial statements have been presented as if the acquisitions of Long Bao Life and Ho-Cheng Insurance had occurred at the beginning
	of the period for which these consolidated financial statements are presented (January 1, 2016). The 2016 financial statements
	have been retroactively adjusted to include the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Long Bao Life and Ho-Cheng
	Insurance.


	 



	Foreign Currency Translation



	 


	The accounts of the Company are maintained
	in the Taiwan $. The accounts of the Company are translated into USD with the Taiwan $ as the functional currency. All assets and
	liabilities are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date, stockholders’ equity is translated at historical
	rates and statement of operations items are translated at the weighted average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation
	adjustments are reported under other comprehensive income. Gains and losses resulting from the translations of foreign currency
	transactions and balances are reflected in the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The following table details
	the exchange rates used for the respective periods:

	Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies



	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of consolidated financial
	statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
	of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions
	related to allowance for sales return and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions
	on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
	results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs
	and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially
	and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual
	results, future results of operations will be affected.


	 



	Principles of Consolidation



	 


	The accompanying consolidated financial
	statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Longbau Group Limited, Longbau Taiwan, Long Bao
	Life and Ho-Cheng Insurance. All significant intercompany transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.


	 



	Cash Equivalents



	 


	For the purpose of the statement of cash
	flows, cash equivalents include time deposits, certificate of deposits, and all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities
	of three months or less.


	 



	Accounts Receivable



	 


	Accounts receivable are recorded, net of
	allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical
	bad debts, customer concentration, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns
	to determine if the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. An estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the
	full amount is no longer probable. Delinquent account balances are written-off after management has determined that the likelihood
	of collection is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified.


	 






	 



	8



	 







	 




	 


	The Company provides a
	merchandise return policy where customers who return the merchandises or cancel the contracts can receive a full refund or
	partial refund of the amount paid within 180 days from date of purchase and contracts. Allowances for sales return are
	established based on management’s estimates of expected returns and historical experiences. As of March 31, 2017 and
	December 31, 2016, there was no allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016,
	allowances for sales return were $0 and $15,871, respectively.


	 



	Inventory



	 


	Inventory is valued at the lower of the
	inventory’s cost or the current market price of the inventory using weighted average cost method. Management compares the
	cost of inventory with its market value and an allowance is made to write down inventory to market value, if lower. As of March
	31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there was no allowance for slow moving or obsolete inventory.


	 



	Property and Equipment, net



	 


	Property and equipment are stated at cost.
	Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred; additions, renewals and improvements are capitalized. When property
	and equipment are retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
	accounts, and any gain or loss is included in operations. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided using the straight-line
	method for substantially all assets with estimated lives as follows:


	 







	Description



	 



	Years






	Land



	 



	N/A






	Office equipment



	 



	3-5 years






	Lease improvements



	 



	3-5 years






	 



	Patent



	 


	The Company capitalizes the acquisition
	cost of its patent and amortizes the capitalized patent costs over 14 years.


	 



	Long-Lived Assets



	 


	Impairment losses are recorded on long-lived
	assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by
	those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which
	the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined
	in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced to recognize the cost of disposal. Based on its review, the Company believes
	that as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, there was no significant impairment of its long-lived assets.


	 



	Trust Investments



	 


	Pursuant to Taiwanese law, 75% of the
	proceeds from preneed sales of merchandise and services are put into trust until such time that the Company meets the
	requirements for releasing the trust amount, which is generally when the service and merchandise are delivered, when the
	preneed contract is canceled and when the balance of the trust fund exceeds 75% of the proceeds from sales of preneed
	contracts. The legal beneficiary of the trust is the Company and the trust is managed by the Company. The investments of such
	trust funds are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair market value; therefore, the unrealized gains and
	losses are included in the statement of operations. Investments that the trust fund can invest in are regulated by the
	authorities. On an annual basis, the Company is obligated to fund any shortfall if the amounts deposited by the customer
	exceed the funds in trust, including all investment income.


	 



	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	 


	For certain of the Company’s financial
	instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, the carrying amounts
	approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.


	 


	ASC Topic 820,

	Fair Value Measurements
	and Disclosures,

	requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825,

	Financial
	Instruments

	, defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement
	that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets
	for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values
	because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current
	market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:


	 




	 



	·




	Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.





	 




	 



	·




	Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.





	 




	 



	·




	Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology use one or more unobservable inputs which are significant to the fair value measurement.





	 






	 



	9



	 







	 




	 



	Deferred Commission Costs



	 


	The Company defers certain direct costs
	related to the acquisition of new preneed contracts. Such costs are expensed as the revenues are recognized. As of March 31, 2017
	and December 31, 2016, the Company had $1,076,308 and $1,036,206 of deferred commission costs, respectively.


	 



	Deferred Preneed Contract Revenues and
	Deferred Revenues – Current



	 


	The Company sells preneed contracts whereby
	the customer enters into arrangements for future merchandise and services prior to the time of need. As these contracts are entered
	into prior to the delivery of the related merchandise and services, the amount collected in advance is recorded in deferred preneed
	contract revenues. If a preneed contract is terminated upon a customer’s request, a refund equal to total amount collected
	by the Company minus 20% of the contract price will be made when the termination is not made within 14 days from the contract initiation
	date. Full refund will be made when the termination is made within 14 days. We do not record accounts receivable in accordance
	with the contractual payment date given the nature of our merchandise and services, the nature of our contracts with customers,
	and the timing of the delivery of our services.


	 


	The Company also offers its merchandise
	and provides funeral hosting services on a stand-alone at-need basis. The amount collected from customer before the merchandises
	and services are delivered is recorded in deferred revenues – current on the balance sheet.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company recognizes revenue when the
	price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been provided, and collectability
	is assured.


	 


	Long Bao Life sells its merchandise and
	services on both a preneed and at-need basis. At need sales are recognized as revenue when the service is performed or merchandise
	is delivered. Pre-need funeral services and funeral merchandise are under contracts that provide for delivery of the services and
	merchandise at the time of need. Revenue associated with sales of preneed funeral contracts is deferred until funeral merchandise
	is delivered or the funeral services are performed, generally at the time of need. Pursuant to Taiwanese law, 75% of the proceeds
	from funeral merchandise or services sold on a preneed basis is required to be paid into trust funds.


	 


	Ho-Cheng Insurance’s revenue is from
	insurance agency and brokerage services. The Company sells insurance products to customers, and obtains commissions from the respective
	insurance carriers according to the terms of each insurance company service agreement. The Company recognizes revenue when the
	following have occurred: persuasive evidence of an agreement between the insurance company and insured exists, services were provided,
	the fee for such services is fixed or determinable and collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. Insurance agency services
	are considered complete, and revenue is recognized, when an insurance policy becomes effective. The Company recognizes revenue
	from insurance carriers on a gross basis. The commission paid by the Company to its agents are recorded as cost of revenues.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company uses the asset and liability
	method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred
	tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion
	of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred
	tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	 


	A tax position is recognized as a benefit
	only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination
	being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
	on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company
	has no uncertain tax positions as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share



	 


	Basic earnings per share (“EPS”)
	is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is based on the assumption that all dilutive
	securities are converted. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and warrants are
	assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby
	were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. There were no potentially dilutive securities
	outstanding during the periods presented.


	 



	Foreign Currency Transactions and Comprehensive
	Income



	 


	U.S. GAAP generally requires recognized
	revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Certain statements, however, require entities to report specific
	changes in assets and liabilities, such as gain or loss on foreign currency translation, as a separate component of the equity
	section of the balance sheet. Such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income. The functional currency
	of the Company is the Taiwan $. Translation gain (loss) of $66,764 and ($21) at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively,
	are classified as an item of other comprehensive income in the stockholders’ equity section of the balance sheet.


	 






	 



	10



	 







	 




	 



	Statement of Cash Flows



	 


	Cash flows from the Company’s operations
	are calculated based upon the local currencies using the average translation rates. As a result, amounts related to assets and
	liabilities reported on the statements of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the
	balance sheets.


	 



	Segment Reporting



	 


	The Company uses the “management
	approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company’s management organizes
	segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance.


	 



	Subsequent Events



	 


	The Company has evaluated all transactions through the financial
	statement issuance date for subsequent event disclosure consideration.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In January 2017, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-01,

	Business Combinations
	(Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business

	. The amendments in this update clarify the definition of a business
	with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions
	or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals,
	goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and
	should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this
	accounting standard update.


	 


	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,

	which requires restricted cash to be presented with cash and cash
	equivalents on the statement of cash flows and disclosure of how the statement of cash flows reconciles to the balance sheet if
	restricted cash is shown separately from cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and
	annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
	impact of this accounting standard update on its financial statements.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases (Topic 842)

	. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet
	and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2018 and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company
	is in the process of evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its financial statements.


	 


	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	.  ASU 2014-09
	is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current
	U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition.  ASU 2014-09 will require that
	companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract.  The ASU also
	will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
	contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill
	a contract.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.   Early
	adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. 
	Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date
	of adoption.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial statements
	and disclosures.


	 


	The Company does not believe
	that any other recently issued effective pronouncements, or pronouncements issued but not yet effective, if adopted, would have
	a material effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

	On December 30, 2014, the Company

	purchase 1,296 square feet of land in Tauyuan, Taiwan for $1,972,063 (Taiwan $62,600,000). The title of the land has
	been transferred to the Company with the ownership certificate held in escrow until the total purchase price is paid.
	Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, payment of $756,450 (Taiwan $24,000,000) was made prior to July 7, 2015. The remaining
	$1,274,605 (Taiwan $38,600,000) payable shall be made when the Company has secured financing. The Company is currently
	seeking a loan from a commercial bank. The land is currently collateral to a bank for the seller’s outstanding
	borrowing.


	 


	Depreciation expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017
	and 2016 was $21,444 and $18,718, respectively.

	Note 9 – Equity




	 



	Long Bao Life and Ho-Cheng
	Insurance’s Articles of Incorporation provide that, when allocating the net profits for each fiscal year, the Company
	shall first offset its losses in previous years and then set aside a legal capital reserve at 10% of the statutory profits
	until the accumulated legal reserve equals the Company’s paid-in capital. Legal capital reserve may be used to offset a
	deficit, or be distributed as dividends in cash or stocks for the portion in excess of 25% of the paid-in capital if the
	Company incurs no loss.


	 



	Note 10 – Concentrations




	 



	The Company maintains substantially all
	its cash with banks in Taiwan. Should any bank holding cash become insolvent, the Company would lose the cash with that bank; however,
	the Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant risks on its cash
	in bank accounts. In Taiwan, a depositor has up to approximately $93,000 (Taiwan $3,000,000) insured in a bank. As of March 31,
	2017, the Company had $147,100 of cash and cash equivalents uninsured.


	 


	The Company purchased 100% of materials
	from one vendor for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 93% of materials from four vendors for the three months ended March
	31, 2016. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the amounts due to these vendors included were $10,372 and $33,265, respectively.
	The Company believes there are numerous other suppliers that could be substituted should the supplier become unavailable or non-competitive.


	 


	The Company received commissions from four
	major insurance carriers for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 for the insurance segment. Each of the insurance carriers
	made up over 10% of the Company’s total revenue during three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. For the three months ended
	March 31, 2017 and 2016, aggregated sales to these carriers were $897,957 and $746,905, respectively.



	 




	Note 11 – Segment Reporting



	 


	The Company uses the “management
	approach” model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a company’s management organizes
	segments within the company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company has three reportable segments:
	Long Bao Life that mainly sells funeral services products; Ho-Cheng Insurance that is an insurance broker; and Longbau Taiwan and
	Long Group, Inc. that provides consulting services. The following tables summarize the Company’s segment information:

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
	CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 


	You should read this Management’s Discussion and Analysis
	in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Related Notes. This discussion contains forward-looking statements
	that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
	statements.


	 



	Overview



	 


	We sell death care management consultant
	services through Longbau Hong Kong, our operating company in Hong Kong, to public consumers across Taiwan. In September 2014,
	we established another subsidiary in Taiwan, Longbau Taiwan, to provide death care consulting service and sell death care products
	across Taiwan. Longbau Taiwan is 100% owned by Longbau Hong Kong.


	 


	We will be providing a variety of death
	care management consultancy services. We consult on the purchase of cemetery property and funeral and cemetery merchandise and
	services at the time of need and on a preneed basis. In addition, the Company specializes in the consultancy for deferred preneed
	funeral and cemetery receipts held in trust, preneed cemetery activities, preneed funeral activities, preneed funeral and cemetery,
	burial vaults, cemetery property, and cemetery property revenue.


	 


	On December 29,
	2016, we, Long Bao Life Technology Co., Ltd (“Long Bao Life”), the shareholders of Long Bao Life, and Tsai Ko, our
	CEO, entered into a share exchange agreement whereby we issued 250,000 shares of our common stock to Long Bao Life shareholders
	in exchange for 100% of Long Bao Life's issued and outstanding ownership interests. Upon completion of the foregoing transaction,
	Long Bao Life became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Long Bao Life was a private company incorporated in Taiwan in 2007.


	 



	Long Bao
	Life provides pre-need and at need funeral services and sells funeral related products, such as urns, in Taiwan. A pre-need death
	care contract enables a customer to make his/her own funeral arrangements in advance and prepay for the funeral, which reduces
	the burden of the family at the time of bereavement as well as avoids the influence of rising costs. In addition, the company provides
	consulting services to customer prior to the purchase. Long Bao Life utilizes various systems, including multi-level marketing
	("MLM") system, to sell the preneed contracts and other products. Under the MLM system, the salespeople are compensated
	not only for sales they generate, but also for the sales of the other salespeople that they recruit.


	This
	recruited sales force is referred to as the participant's "downline", and can provide multiple levels of compensation.


	MLM is one type of direct selling. The salespeople are expected to sell products directly to consumers
	by means of relationship


	referrals and word of mouth marketing. MLM salespeople not only sell
	the Long Bao Life products but also encourage others to


	join the Long Bao Life as a distributor.
	Long Bao Life also sales its preneed contracts and other products through agents where it pays a fixed amount of commission.



	 


	On December 29,
	2016, we, Ho-Cheng Insurance Brokers Co., Ltd. (“Ho-Cheng Insurance”), the shareholders of Ho-Cheng Insurance and Tsai
	Ko entered into a share exchange agreement whereby we issued 250,000 shares of our common stock to Ho-Cheng Insurance shareholders
	in exchange for 100% of Ho-Cheng Insurance’s issued and outstanding ownership interests. Upon completion of the foregoing
	transaction, Ho-Cheng Insurance became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Ho-Cheng Insurance was a private company incorporated in Taiwan

	Ho-Cheng Insurance,
	a Taiwan based insurance intermediary company focuses on sales of life, property and casualty insurance products underwritten by
	insurance companies as well as insurance brokerage services. The company has been cooperating with many insurance companies operating
	in Taiwan to distribute a wide variety of insurance products to customers.


	 


	Tsai Ko, our Chief
	Executive Officer, Director and owner of 30% of our outstanding common stock was (i) the Chief Executive Officer of Long Bao Life
	and owner of 12% of Long Bao Life’s ownership interests; and (ii) owner of 25% of Ho-Cheng Insurance’s ownership interests.


	 


	Yueh-Kuei Ko,
	our Chief Financial Officer, Director, and owner of 5% of our outstanding common stock was (i) a Long Bao Life Director and 18%
	owner of Long Bao Life’s ownership’s interests and (ii) the Chief Executive Officer of Ho-Cheng Insurance and a 25%
	owner of Ho-Cheng Insurance’s ownership interests.


	 


	Tsai Ko, Yueh-Kuei
	Ko and relatives of each collectively owned a majority interest in both Long Bao Life and Ho-Cheng Insurance.


	 


	Long Bao Life, Ho-Cheng and us were entities
	under common control and had been since the earliest period presented in these consolidated financial statements included elsewhere
	in this Form 10-Q; therefore, the consolidated financial statements have been presented as if the acquisitions of Long Bao Life
	and Ho-Cheng Insurance had occurred at the beginning of the period for which consolidated financial statements are presented.

	Results of Operations




	 





	For the three months ended March
	31, 2017 and 2016




	 




	Revenues.


	 For the three
	months ended March 31, 2017, we generated revenues of $2,235,353 as compared to $1,780,746 for three months ended March 31, 2016,
	an increase of $454,607 or 25.5%. Revenue from our funeral services segment increased by $12,560 or 3.0% from $424,406 in 2016
	to $436,966 in 2017. The increase is principally due to the net increase of revenue from preneed contract termination and funeral
	hosting fees, which is offset by the decrease of sales of urns. Additionally, the Company had $38,648 consulting revenues for services
	provided to companies controlled by related parties during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Revenue from our insurance segment
	increased by $442,047 or 32.6% from $1,356,340 in 2016 to $1,798,387 in 2017. The increase is principally due to more sales of
	insurance products. We had no revenue from our consulting services segment during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.


	 




	Cost of revenues.


	For the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, our cost of revenues was $1,599,017 as compared to $1,282,101 for the three months ended March
	31, 2016, an increase of $316,916 or 24.7%. The increase is principally due to the increase in revenue. As a percentage of revenues,
	our cost of revenue for three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were 71.5% and 72.0%, respectively.



	 





	General and administrative expenses.


	 For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had general and administrative expenses of $408,431 as compared to $392,052
	for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $16,379 or 4.2%. As a percentage of revenues, our general and administrative
	expenses for three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were 18.3% and 22.0%, respectively. The increase in dollars is principally
	due to an increase in professional fees.


	 




	Other income (expense).


	 For
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had other expenses, net of $68,572 as compared to $72,749 for the three months ended
	March 31, 2016, a decrease of $4,177 or 5.7%. The decrease is principally due to an increase in investment losses. Additionally,
	the Company recorded penalty of $22,545 for early termination of an office lease.


	 




	Net loss.


	 For the three
	months ended March 31, 2017, we had net income of $81,391 as compared to a net loss of $16,534 for the three months ended March
	31, 2016, an increase in net income of $97,925 or 592.3%. The increase in net income is mainly due to the increase in revenue.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources Operations



	 


	As of March 31, 2017, we had cash on hand
	of $304,202.


	 




	Operating activities


	. For
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, we used cash in operating activities of $301,591 as compared to $636,229 for the three months
	ended March 31, 2016. The decrease is principally due to changes in operating assets and liabilities.



	 





	Investing activities


	. For
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, we generated cash from investing activities of $32 as compared to cash used in investing
	activities of $81,964 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease is principally due to a decrease in cash advance
	for planned acquisitions and purchase of property and equipment.


	 




	Financing activities


	. For
	the three months ended March 31, 2017, we generated cash from financing activities of $92,111 as compared to $305,323 for the three
	months ended March 31, 2016.


	 


	We had a negative working capital at March
	31, 2017 and had net cash outflow for operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017. These factors raise substantial
	doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for
	us to continue as a going concern.


	 


	We plan to fund our operations from loans
	from our major shareholders and we may raise equity capital by offering shares of our common stock to investors as well as from
	our operations. There is no obligation by the shareholders to provide such funding.


	 


	Although the Company believes its revenues
	from operations will eliminate the need to raise additional funding to expand its business operations over the next 12 months,
	there is no guarantee additional funding will not be required. If financing is needed and we are not able to raise the capital
	necessary to fund our business expansion objectives, we may have to delay the implementation of our business plan.


	 


	We do not currently have any arrangements
	for financing. Obtaining additional funding will be subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions, investor
	acceptance of our business plan and initial results from our business operations. These factors may impact the timing, amount,
	terms or conditions of additional financing available to us. The most likely source of future funds available to us is through
	the sale of additional shares of common stock or advances from our major shareholders or directors and, if we are able to obtain
	equity financing, it will likely result in significant additional dilution to the interests of our current stockholders and may
	include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your right as a stockholder. The Company may obtain financing by
	issuing debt which may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions,
	such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. There can be no assurance that we will be
	able to obtain such additional financing is needed and if we cannot receive such financing we may be forced to suspend or cease
	operations.

	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	Our financial statements and related public
	financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP").
	US GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have
	an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses amounts reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information
	contained in our external disclosures including information regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our
	use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base
	our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
	Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant
	estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.


	 


	We believe the following is among the most
	critical accounting policies that impact our consolidated financial statements. We suggest that our significant accounting policies,
	as described in our financial statements in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, be read in conjunction with this Management's
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.


	 



	Use of Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements
	in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
	financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates
	estimates and assumptions related to deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions
	on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
	results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs
	and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially
	and adversely from the Company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual
	results, future results of operations will be affected.



	 




	Accounts Receivable



	 


	Accounts receivable are recorded, net of allowance for doubtful
	accounts and sales returns. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts, customer
	concentration, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to determine if the
	allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate. An estimate for doubtful accounts is made when collection of the full amount is no
	longer probable. Delinquent account balances are written-off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection
	is not probable and known bad debts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when identified.


	 


	The Company provides merchandise return
	policy where customers who return the merchandises or cancel the contracts can receive full refund or partial refund of the amount
	paid within 180 days from date of purchase and contracts. Allowance for sales return is established based on management’s
	estimates of expected returns and historical experiences.


	 



	Inventory



	 


	Inventory is valued at the lower of the
	inventory’s cost or the current market price of the inventory using weighted average cost method. Management compares the
	cost of inventory using weighted average cost method with its market value and an allowance is made to write down inventory to
	market value, if lower.


	 



	Trust Investments



	 


	Pursuant to Taiwanese law, 75% of the proceeds
	from preneed sales of merchandise and services are put into trust until such time that the Company meets the requirements for releasing
	trust amount, which is generally when the service and merchandise are delivered, when the preneed contract is canceled and when
	the balance of the trust fund exceeds 75% of the proceeds from sales of preneed contracts. The legal beneficiary of the trust is
	the Company. The investments of such trust funds are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair market value; therefore,
	the unrealized gains and losses are included in the statement of operations. Targets that the trust fund can invest in are regulated
	by the authorities. On an annual basis, the Company is obligated to fund any shortfall if the amounts deposited by the customer
	exceed the funds in trust, including all investment income.


	 



	Deferred Commission Costs



	 


	The Company defers certain preneed contracts
	direct obtaining costs related to the acquisition of new preneed contracts. Such costs are expenses as the revenues are recognized.


	 



	Deferred Preneed Contract Revenues and
	Deferred Revenues – Current



	 


	The Company sells preneed contracts whereby
	the customer enters into arrangements for future merchandise and services prior to the time of need. As these contracts are entered
	into prior to the delivery of the related merchandise and services, amount collected in advance is recorded in deferred preneed
	contract revenues. If a preneed contract is terminated upon a customer’s request, a refund equal to total amount collected
	by the Company minus 20% of the contract price will be made when the termination is not made within 14 days from the contract initiation
	date. Full refund will be made when the termination is made within 14 days. We do not record accounts receivable in accordance
	with the contractual payment date given the nature of our merchandise and services, the nature of our contracts with customers,
	and the timing of the delivery of our services.

	The Company also offers its merchandise
	and provides funeral hosting services on a stand-alone at need basis. Amount collected from customer before the merchandises and
	services are delivered is recorded in deferred revenues – current on the balance sheet.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence
	of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable.


	 


	At need sales are recognized as revenue
	when the service is performed or merchandise is delivered. Pre-need funeral services and funeral merchandise under contracts that
	provide for delivery of the services and merchandise at the time of need. Revenue associated with sales of preneed funeral contracts
	is deferred until funeral merchandise is delivered or the funeral services are performed, generally at the time of need. Pursuant
	to Taiwanese law, 75% of the proceeds from funeral merchandise or services sold on a preneed basis is required to be paid into
	trust funds.


	 


	We sell insurance products to customers,
	and obtains commissions from the respective insurance carriers according to the terms of each insurance company service agreement.
	We recognize revenue when the following have occurred: persuasive evidence of an agreement between the insurance company and insured
	exists, services were provided, the fee for such services is fixed or determinable and collectability of the fee is reasonably
	assured. Insurance agency services are considered complete, and revenue is recognized, when an insurance policy becomes effective.


	 



	Income Taxes



	 


	We use the asset and liability method of
	accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, and deferred tax
	liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts
	of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
	management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred
	tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	 


	A tax position is recognized as a benefit
	only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination
	being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
	on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	 


	In January 2017, the Financial Accounting
	Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2017-01,

	Business Combinations
	(Topic 805) Clarifying the Definition of a Business

	. The amendments in this update clarify the definition of a business
	with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions
	or disposals of assets or businesses. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals,
	goodwill, and consolidation. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and
	should be applied prospectively on or after the effective date. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this
	accounting standard update.


	 


	In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18,

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,

	which requires restricted cash to be presented with cash and cash
	equivalents on the statement of cash flows and disclosure of how the statement of cash flows reconciles to the balance sheet if
	restricted cash is shown separately from cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-18 is effective for interim and
	annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
	impact of this accounting standard update on its financial statements.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases (Topic 842)

	. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet
	and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
	15, 2018 and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company
	is in the process of evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its financial statements.


	 


	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers

	.  ASU 2014-09
	is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current
	U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition.  ASU 2014-09 will require that
	companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract.  The ASU also
	will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer
	contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill
	a contract.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.   Early
	adoption is permitted only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. 
	Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date
	of adoption.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company's financial statements
	and disclosures.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
	and Procedures.




	 


	Our management, with the participation
	of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
	procedures. The term “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
	Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by
	a company in the reports, such as this report, that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
	and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
	without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports
	that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its
	principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management
	recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
	achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible
	controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, Tsai Ko, our Chief Executive Officer and Yueh-Kuei Ko, the Company’s Chief
	Financial Officer, concluded that as of March 31, 2017, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the following
	material weaknesses in our control environment and financial reporting process consisting of the following as of March 31, 2017:


	 




	 



	1.




	lack of a functioning audit committee due to a lack of a majority of independent members and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our Board of Directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal control and procedures;





	 



	2.




	inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives;





	 



	3.




	ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes; and





	 



	4.




	lack of accounting personnel with adequate experience and training.





	 



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting.




	 



	During the three months ended March 31,
	2017, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation performed
	during the first quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
	internal control over financial reporting.
