Successful Turnaround Continues to Elevate Bank to Record Performance

STAMFORD, Conn., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. ("Patriot" or the "Bancorp") (NASDAQ:PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the "Bank"), today announced its intention to begin making quarterly dividends for shareholders of the community bank's stock, another sign of its continuing strong performance.  With this announcement, Patriot has declared its first quarterly dividend of $.01 per share.  The record date for this quarterly dividend will be July 24, 2017, with a dividend payment date of August 1, 2017.  This is the first time since the financial crisis that the Bank has declared a dividend.
Patriot has recorded multiple strong fiscal quarters and proven earnings stability under the leadership of its Chairman, Michael Carrazza, who assumed the role of interim CEO in August 2016.  In October 2016, the Bank strengthened and diversified its executive leadership team and in February 2017 promoted Richard Muskus Jr. from within to serve as its President. 
At the end of the 2016 fiscal year, Patriot surpassed the three quarters of a billion-dollar milestone, with strong growth continuing into 2017.  In the first fiscal quarter of 2017, Patriot reported net income of $1,730,000, or $0.44 per diluted share, a 165% increase over the prior year.  First quarter earnings also increased 66% over the prior quarter.  
CEO Michael Carrazza stated: "Patriot's improving performance is a direct result of ongoing operational efficiencies, product diversification and asset growth.  These changes continue to yield a positive impact, which now serve as a catalyst to reactivate the Bank's dividend policy for the first time since 2008."  Patriot has 3,894,128 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2017.
The head of private investment firm Solaia Capital Advisors, Mr. Carrazza designed and led the recapitalization transaction to rescue and turnaround Patriot, which became deeply troubled during the financial crisis. "Patriot has never been as strong and healthy as it is today.  With continued steady growth and new achievements, we plan to continue declaring quarterly dividends to our shareholders," he added.
As of March 31, 2017, total Bank assets increased to $775 million, as compared to $636 million at March 31, 2016.  Net loans totaled $625 million, up 30% over $480 million at March 31, 2016.   Deposits grew to $561 million at March 31, 2017 as compared to $424 million at March 31 2016.  Patriot has seen total deposits grow an aggregate of 32% over the last year.  The Bank's capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its "well capitalized" regulatory status. 
About the Patriot National Bancorp, Inc.
Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut and the Bank has full service branches in Connecticut and New York.
Since opening its doors in 1994, Patriot's mission has been to serve our local communities by helping our neighbors and neighborhood businesses thrive. All lending is handled locally and is specific to each borrower, and the commitment to local businesses goes further to connect, support and grow businesses in both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors, along with municipalities. Patriot believes a well-connected community is a strong community—and that together, all will prosper.
"Safe Harbor" Statement Under Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
Certain statements contained in Bancorp's public statements, including this one, may be forward looking and subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These factors include, but are not limited to, (1) changes in prevailing interest rates which would affect the interest earned on Bancorp's interest earning assets and the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities, (2) the timing of repricing of Bancorp's interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, (3) the effect of changes in governmental monetary policy, (4) the components of Bancorp's periodic earnings and assets, (5) the fact that certain of the income recognized by Bancorp in any quarter may not be repeated in future periods, (6) the effect of changes in regulations applicable to Bancorp and the Bank and the conduct of its business, (7) changes in competition among financial service companies, including possible further encroachment of non-banks on services traditionally provided by banks, (8) the ability of competitors that are larger than Bancorp to provide products and services which it is impracticable for Bancorp to provide, (9) the state of the economy and real estate values in Bancorp's market areas, and the consequent effect on the quality of Bancorp's loans, (10) recent governmental initiatives that are expected to have a profound effect on the financial services industry and could dramatically change the competitive environment of Patriot, (11) other legislative or regulatory changes, including those related to residential mortgages, changes in accounting standards, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") premiums that may adversely affect Patriot, (12) the application of generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,  (13) the fact that one period of reported results may not be indicative of future periods,  (14)  the state of the economy in the greater New York metropolitan area and its particular effect on Patriot's customers, vendors and communities and other such factors, including risk factors, as may be described in Bancorp's other filings with the SEC.

Patriot National Bancorp : Connecticut nonprofits on the chopping block amid state budget impasse

Patriot Bank President Richard Muskus Jr. speaks on the importance of government funding for nonprofits, as well as Patriot's ongoing support of the sector.


        The state budget impasse is already being felt by a number of sectors, but perhaps none as much as the nonprofit segment.
      

        'I think it's a horrible situation,' said Eileen Healy, executive director of Independence Northwest. One of the state's five Centers for Independent Living, the Naugatuck-based advocacy program for the disabled already reduced its catchment area from 44 towns to about 10 last year, with further reductions possibly on the way.
      

        'At this point we're pretty much limited to the greater Waterbury area,' Healy said. 'We would love to keep serving places like Newtown, Bethel and Danbury as we have in the past. If someone comes to us we'll help them, but we can no longer go to them.'
      

        Since 1988, the five centers had served all 169 of the state's towns and cities but with last year's reduction in state funding, from nearly $529,000 to about $202,000, they now serve only 25, including Bridgeport, Stratford and Trumbull in Fairfield County.
      

        Independence Northwest slashed salaries throughout the organization last year but is maintaining its staff of 11 full-time and four part-time employees.
      

        Funds for the five centers will likely take another hit when a budget is passed, Healy added, with Republicans budgeting $372,000 and Democrats proposing $250,000. 'We've planned for the worst and budgeted accordingly,' she said. If funding is cut, 'A couple of positions will probably be reduced to part time and we may have layoffs.'
      

        'We don't know when the funds are coming, but we're still supposed to do the work,' Healy said. 'Some nonprofits have been told to cease services, but we have not - at least not at this point.'
      

        Twenty-six nonprofit providers that contract with the state Department of Social Services were informed the would no longer receive funding as of the close of business on July 1, with some funding provided through Aug. 1 to help them transition to the new reality. Those included programs offered by the Greater Bridgeport Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Program; Person-to-Person Inc., a Darien-based provider of basic needs and services to the underprivileged; Career Resources Inc. and Families in Crisis Inc., both of Bridgeport; and the Community Action Agency of Western Connecticut Inc. in Danbury.
      

        Meanwhile, a survey conducted by the Connecticut Community Nonprofit Alliance as the July 1 budget deadline approached painted a similar gloomy picture. In answer to how they would plan for a reduced level of funding, 82 percent of Alliance members said they would be forced to lay off staff; 77 percent that they would need to reduce services or programs; 60 percent that they would eliminate programs entirely; 57 percent would reduce service hours; and 45 percent would stop accepting new clients.
      

        'We know that if things don't change, thousands of Connecticut residents will go without the care they need,' said Gian-Carl Casa, president and CEO of the nonprofit alliance. 'Depending on how long the situation goes on, there may be some places that will be forced to shut down.'
      

        The alliance has proposed to lawmakers a plan it says would save approximately $300 million over two years by shifting more services from more expensive state government agencies into the nonprofit sector.
      

        As an example, the alliance said that the cost for group homes serving the developmentally disabled is $152,000 per person. If half of the 888 people still in state care are shifted to nonprofits, the state would realize a gain of almost $100 million over the next two years.
      

        Casa noted that the change would not be a new one, as more than 86 percent of people receiving state services for developmental disabilities are getting them through community-based nonprofits.
      

        'By supporting the more expensive status quo over new ways to deliver services, the state chooses to deprive people of care they need,' he wrote on the alliance's website. 'There are more than 2,000 people on the waiting list at the Department of Developmental Services and they may never receive services if we maintain the current inefficient and expensive service delivery system.'
      

        Robert Francis, executive director of Regional Youth Adult Social Action Partnership in Bridgeport and an alliance board member, endorses the Casa proposal, especially as his organization is already facing a number of cuts. State funding makes up about $800,000 of its $2.4 million annual budget, Francis said.
      

        While the Department of Children and Families has maintained its funding, money from the Department of Mental Health & Addiction Services and the Judicial Department remain in limbo. As a result, the partnership has already laid off two members of its Street Gang program and instituted a one-day furlough for its remaining 17 full-time and seven part-time employees, who are required to take off one day every two weeks.
      

        Noting that to date Bridgeport this year has already seen 17 homicides, Francis said those numbers 'are always higher from June to September. This is the worst possible time to pull our (anti-gang violence) guys off the street.'
      

        Martin Schwartz, president and CEO of The Kennedy Center in Trumbull, said that two of his organization's key funders have already promised cutbacks. The Department of Social Services announced a 10 percent cut across the board, which will include six furlough days during which the state will not reimburse programs serving people with disabilities; the first will be on July 26.
      

        'We will be closed on those days,' said Schwartz. 'But we still have our own expenses and overhead.' Noting that many of Kennedy's 750 employees make $12 an hour, 'Going a day without pay is a pretty difficult thing to do,' he said,
      

        Schwartz said each furlough day would cost the organization about $55,000. 'And that's on top of the cuts we've already made over the past several years,' he added, which included laying off about 50 workers.
      

        In addition, cuts by the Department of Rehabilitation Services will result in the layoffs of nine Kennedy Center employees who work with the visually impaired if no budget is in place by July 31.
      

        'I've been here for 39 years,' Schwartz said, 'and I've never seen anything like this. I always thought that one of the primary purposes of a society is to take care of its most vulnerable people, but that's not the case in Connecticut right now.'
      

        In Bridgeport, The Center for Family Justice President and CEO Debra Greenwood said her organization has been ramping up fundraising efforts through events and appeals to corporations and individuals over the past year in the face of declining state support. The Center laid off five employees, four of them full time, last fall but is hoping to hold on to its 41 remaining staffers.
      

        As its staff has dwindled, its workload has increased, Greenwood said. Its safe house for victims of domestic violence is at 125 percent capacity. By combining services with other nonprofits, the Center is maintaining its level of service for now, she said.
      

        'The big question is, if we and other nonprofits don't do the work, who will? It won't be the municipalities. They might be able to for a short period of time, but you need experts to do this kind of work.'
      

        The Bridgeport Public Education Fund Inc., whose services include college access programs, has 'never wanted money from the state or the feds - it's too onerous a process,' said Executive Director Marge Hiller.
      

        Even so, the organization has continued to struggle financially as the purse strings of corporate and individual donors have tightened over the past few years. Although it ended 2016 in the black after posting the first deficit in its 34-year-history in 2015, that was only accomplished by laying off one employee and cutting back on some services, including reducing its two-day college prep workshop to one day. 'We're pretty lean to begin with, so there are not a lot of places to cut,' Hiller said.
      

        Even so, the $10,000 donations it used to get are now usually more in the $5,000 range, she said, adding that unless things dramatically improve, the nonprofit will undergo 'a total restructuring' next year.
      

        One reliable source of nongovernmental funding has traditionally been banks, but even they have refocused their priorities. Hiller said that the likes of Citibank, Bank of America and Chase have been redirecting their resources toward community development. The First Niagara Bank Foundation said it would end its funding by 2020 following its 2016 merger with KeyBank, Hiller said.
      

Richard Muskus Jr., president of Patriot National Bancorp Inc., said that while Stamford-based Patriot Bank will continue to provide support to nonprofits, especially in the education and community development areas, it is incumbent upon the state to supply most of the necessary funds.


'The landscape for nonprofits throughout the state of Connecticut is certainly stressed at this point,' he said. 'A lot of nonprofits are going to have to reinvent themselves to some degree, which could include shedding some assets. Our hope is that once the state sorts things out, the money will flow down and stabilize those organizations.'


'The state government, legislators and the governor alike, are being very short-sighted. If these service organizations go out of business, the state will have to pick up those services and their costs, which means the taxpayer will have to pay so much more. And if we need to lay off staff, those people are no longer paying income tax,' Muskus said.

Patriot National Bancorp Inc., the parent company of Patriot Bank N.A., has announced its intention to begin making quarterly dividends for shareholders of the community bank’s stock for the first time since 2008.
Patriot declared its first quarterly dividend of 1 cent per share, with a record date of July 24 and a dividend payment date of Aug. 1. This is the first time since the financial crisis that the bank has declared a dividend.
“Patriot’s improving performance is a direct result of ongoing operational efficiencies, product diversification and asset growth,” CEO Michael Carrazza said. “These changes continue to yield a positive impact, which now serve as a catalyst to reactivate the bank’s dividend policy.”
Patriot has 3,894,128 shares outstanding as of June 30.
At the end of its 2016 fiscal year, Patriot surpassed the three quarters of a billion-dollar milestone. In the first fiscal quarter of 2017, Patriot reported net income of $1.73 million or 44 cents per diluted share, a 165 percent increase over the prior year. First-quarter earnings increased 66 percent over the prior quarter.
As of March 31, total bank assets increased to $775 million, as compared with $636 million on March 31, 2016. Net loans totaled $625 million, up 30 percent over $480 million on March 31, 2016. Deposits grew to $561 million as of March 31, compared with $424 million at March 31, 2016. The bank has seen total deposits grow an aggregate of 32 percent over the last year.
Patriot National Bancorp Inc. is headquartered in Stamford. The bank has branches in Connecticut and New York.

                    Monday, July 17, 2017 1:33 PM  UTC

STAMFORD, Conn., July  17, 2017   -- Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (“Patriot” or the “Bancorp”) (NASDAQ:PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), today announced its intention to begin making quarterly dividends for shareholders of the community bank’s stock, another sign of its continuing strong performance.  With this announcement, Patriot has declared its first quarterly dividend of $.01 per share.  The record date for this quarterly dividend will be July 24, 2017, with a dividend payment date of August 1, 2017.  This is the first time since the financial crisis that the Bank has declared a dividend.
Patriot has recorded multiple strong fiscal quarters and proven earnings stability under the leadership of its Chairman, Michael Carrazza, who assumed the role of interim CEO in August 2016.  In October 2016, the Bank strengthened and diversified its executive leadership team and in February 2017 promoted Richard Muskus Jr. from within to serve as its President.  At the end of the 2016 fiscal year, Patriot surpassed the three quarters of a billion-dollar milestone, with strong growth continuing into 2017.  In the first fiscal quarter of 2017, Patriot reported net income of $1,730,000, or $0.44 per diluted share, a 165% increase over the prior year.  First quarter earnings also increased 66% over the prior quarter.   CEO Michael Carrazza stated: “Patriot’s improving performance is a direct result of ongoing operational efficiencies, product diversification and asset growth.  These changes continue to yield a positive impact, which now serve as a catalyst to reactivate the Bank’s dividend policy for the first time since 2008.”  Patriot has 3,894,128 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2017. The head of private investment firm Solaia Capital Advisors, Mr. Carrazza designed and led the recapitalization transaction to rescue and turnaround Patriot, which became deeply troubled during the financial crisis. “Patriot has never been as strong and healthy as it is today.  With continued steady growth and new achievements, we plan to continue declaring quarterly dividends to our shareholders,” he added. As of March 31, 2017, total Bank assets increased to $775 million, as compared to $636 million at March 31, 2016.  Net loans totaled $625 million, up 30% over $480 million at March 31, 2016.   Deposits grew to $561 million at March 31, 2017 as compared to $424 million at March 31 2016.  Patriot has seen total deposits grow an aggregate of 32% over the last year.  The Bank’s capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its “well capitalized” regulatory status.  About the Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut and the Bank has full service branches in Connecticut and New York. Since opening its doors in 1994, Patriot’s mission has been to serve our local communities by helping our neighbors and neighborhood businesses thrive. All lending is handled locally and is specific to each borrower, and the commitment to local businesses goes further to connect, support and grow businesses in both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors, along with municipalities. Patriot believes a well-connected community is a strong community—and that together, all will prosper. “Safe Harbor” Statement Under Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Certain statements contained in Bancorp’s public statements, including this one, may be forward looking and subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. These factors include, but are not limited to, (1) changes in prevailing interest rates which would affect the interest earned on Bancorp’s interest earning assets and the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities, (2) the timing of repricing of Bancorp’s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, (3) the effect of changes in governmental monetary policy, (4) the components of Bancorp’s periodic earnings and assets, (5) the fact that certain of the income recognized by Bancorp in any quarter may not be repeated in future periods, (6) the effect of changes in regulations applicable to Bancorp and the Bank and the conduct of its business, (7) changes in competition among financial service companies, including possible further encroachment of non-banks on services traditionally provided by banks, (8) the ability of competitors that are larger than Bancorp to provide products and services which it is impracticable for Bancorp to provide, (9) the state of the economy and real estate values in Bancorp’s market areas, and the consequent effect on the quality of Bancorp’s loans, (10) recent governmental initiatives that are expected to have a profound effect on the financial services industry and could dramatically change the competitive environment of Patriot, (11) other legislative or regulatory changes, including those related to residential mortgages, changes in accounting standards, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) premiums that may adversely affect Patriot, (12) the application of generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,  (13) the fact that one period of reported results may not be indicative of future periods,  (14)  the state of the economy in the greater New York metropolitan area and its particular effect on Patriot’s customers, vendors and communities and other such factors, including risk factors, as may be described in Bancorp’s other filings with the SEC.

STAMFORD, Conn. -- Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ Capital
Market: PNBK), the parent of Patriot National Bank, reported record
quarterly earnings for the quarter ended June 30, 2006 of $508,000
($0.16 diluted income per share) representing an increase of 45% over
net income of $351,000 ($0.14 diluted income per share) reported for the
quarter ended June 30, 2005. For the six months ended June 30, 2006 net
income of $907,000 ($0.28 diluted income per share) was up 42% compared
to net income of $638,000 ($0.25 diluted income per share) reported for
the six months ended June 30, 2005. The solid performance was the result
of strong growth in loans and deposits which led to an improved net
interest margin and higher levels of net interest income.During the most recent quarter total loans increased $42 million,
or 10%, from $408 million at March 31, 2006 to $450 million at June 30,
2006. Total loans at June 30, 2006 were up $150 million, or 50%, from
$301 million at June 30, 2005. The Bank achieved excellent growth in
construction, commercial real estate and residential mortgage loans due
to the continued strength in the local real estate market. Credit
quality remains strong. Non-accruing loans, at $4.5 million, are
unchanged from the quarter ended March 31, 2006 and represent three
loans that are adequately collateralized and in the process of
collection.Total assets at June 30, 2006 were $559 million representing an
increase of $51 million, or 10%, from March 31, 2006. Compared to June
30, 2005 assets have increased $143 million or 34%. Total deposits
increased $29 million, or 7%, from $444 million at March 31, 2006 to
$473 million at June 30, 2006. Total deposits increased $105 million, or
29%, from June 30, 2005 when deposits were $367 million. Non-interest
bearing deposits were up 2% for the most recent quarter and 26% for the
latest twelve month period.The growth in the balance sheet resulted in the net interest income
increasing 42% from $3,494,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2005 to
$4,967,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2006. For the six months ended
June 30, 2006 net interest income was $9,578,000, representing an
increase of 39%, compared to $6,908,000 for the six months ended June
30, 2005. The net interest margin for the quarter ended June 30, 2006
was 3.80% compared to 3.46% for the same period in the prior year. The
net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2006 was 3.87% when
the Bank collected default interest on a non-accruing loan. Excluding
this item, the margin would have been 3.79% for the first quarter.Non-interest income was $581,000 for the quarter ended June 30,
2006, a decrease of 29%, from $821,000 for the quarter ended June 30,
2005. For the six months ended June 30, 2006 non-interest income of
$1,212,000 was down 21% from the same period in the prior year. The
reduction in non-interest income was due primarily to mortgage brokerage
referral fees and loan processing fees as a result of a lower volume of
residential mortgage closings caused by the rising interest rate
environment. Non-interest expenses increased 21% to $4,395,000 for the
quarter ended June 30, 2006 and increased 20% to $8,434,000 for the six
months ended June 30, 2006. Salaries and benefits and outside services
were higher due to additional personnel and recruitment costs and higher
levels of sales and incentive compensation. Occupancy costs increased
due to costs of additional branch and loan production office locations
and costs associated with additional space for the lending and credit
administration functions.Mr. Charles F. Howell, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Patriot National Bank, stated that he was very gratified by the strong
performance for the most recent quarter. The Bank continues to execute
its strategic plan by developing new relationships and expanding
existing ones with small and medium-sized businesses, commercial real
estate investors and builders, professionals and consumers while
delivering high quality products and services. The Company remains
focused on opportunities that will allow it to expand in contiguous markets. In July, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire a
small branch office in New York City that will permit the Bank to expand
its branch locations into Westchester County, New York.The Company continues to identify markets with strong potential for
future branch expansion and currently has regulatory approval to operate
four additional branch offices in Connecticut which are planned to open
in the fourth quarter of this year. Patriot National Bank is
headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut and currently has ten full
service branches in Stamford, Darien, Greenwich, Norwalk, Old Greenwich,
Southport and Wilton, Conn. Patriot National Bank also has loan
production offices in Stamford, Connecticut and New York City and
Melville, New York.

Successful Turnaround Continues to Elevate Bank to Record Performance

STAMFORD, Conn., July  17, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. ("Patriot" or the "Bancorp") (NASDAQ:PNBK), the parent company of Patriot Bank, N.A. (the "Bank"), today announced its intention to begin making quarterly dividends for shareholders of the community bank's stock, another sign of its continuing strong performance.  With this announcement, Patriot has declared its first quarterly dividend of $.01 per share.  The record date for this quarterly dividend will be July 24, 2017, with a dividend payment date of August 1, 2017.  This is the first time since the financial crisis that the Bank has declared a dividend.
Patriot has recorded multiple strong fiscal quarters and proven earnings stability under the leadership of its Chairman, Michael Carrazza, who assumed the role of interim CEO in August 2016.  In October 2016, the Bank strengthened and diversified its executive leadership team and in February 2017 promoted Richard Muskus Jr. from within to serve as its President. 
At the end of the 2016 fiscal year, Patriot surpassed the three quarters of a billion-dollar milestone, with strong growth continuing into 2017.  In the first fiscal quarter of 2017, Patriot reported net income of $1,730,000, or $0.44 per diluted share, a 165% increase over the prior year.  First quarter earnings also increased 66% over the prior quarter.  
CEO Michael Carrazza stated: "Patriot's improving performance is a direct result of ongoing operational efficiencies, product diversification and asset growth.  These changes continue to yield a positive impact, which now serve as a catalyst to reactivate the Bank's dividend policy for the first time since 2008."  Patriot has 3,894,128 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2017.
The head of private investment firm Solaia Capital Advisors, Mr. Carrazza designed and led the recapitalization transaction to rescue and turnaround Patriot, which became deeply troubled during the financial crisis. "Patriot has never been as strong and healthy as it is today.  With continued steady growth and new achievements, we plan to continue declaring quarterly dividends to our shareholders," he added.
As of March 31, 2017, total Bank assets increased to $775 million, as compared to $636 million at March 31, 2016.  Net loans totaled $625 million, up 30% over $480 million at March 31, 2016.   Deposits grew to $561 million at March 31, 2017 as compared to $424 million at March 31 2016.  Patriot has seen total deposits grow an aggregate of 32% over the last year.  The Bank's capital ratios continue to be strong, as the Bank maintained its "well capitalized" regulatory status. 
About the Patriot National Bancorp, Inc.
Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut and the Bank has full service branches in Connecticut and New York.
Since opening its doors in 1994, Patriot's mission has been to serve our local communities by helping our neighbors and neighborhood businesses thrive. All lending is handled locally and is specific to each borrower, and the commitment to local businesses goes further to connect, support and grow businesses in both the for-profit and nonprofit sectors, along with municipalities. Patriot believes a well-connected community is a strong community—and that together, all will prosper.

Patriot Bank announces first quarterly cash dividend since 2008

By Kevin Zimmerman -   July 17, 2017

Patriot National Bancorp Inc., the parent company of Patriot Bank N.A., has announced its intention to begin making quarterly dividends for shareholders of the community bank’s stock for the first time since 2008.
Patriot declared its first quarterly dividend of 1 cent per share, with a record date of July 24 and a dividend payment date of Aug. 1. This is the first time since the financial crisis that the bank has declared a dividend.
“Patriot’s improving performance is a direct result of ongoing operational efficiencies, product diversification and asset growth,” CEO Michael Carrazza said. “These changes continue to yield a positive impact, which now serve as a catalyst to reactivate the bank’s dividend policy.”
Patriot has 3,894,128 shares outstanding as of June 30.
At the end of its 2016 fiscal year, Patriot surpassed the three quarters of a billion-dollar milestone. In the first fiscal quarter of 2017, Patriot reported net income of $1.73 million or 44 cents per diluted share, a 165 percent increase over the prior year. First-quarter earnings increased 66 percent over the prior quarter.
As of March 31, total bank assets increased to $775 million, as compared with $636 million on March 31, 2016. Net loans totaled $625 million, up 30 percent over $480 million on March 31, 2016. Deposits grew to $561 million as of March 31, compared with $424 million at March 31, 2016. The bank has seen total deposits grow an aggregate of 32 percent over the last year.
Patriot National Bancorp Inc. is headquartered in Stamford. The bank has branches in Connecticut and New York.

Patriot Events Series




Saturday, June 10, 2017
6:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.


Halloween Yacht Club,
10 Seaview Avenue, Stamford, Connecticut.


Schedule:


6:00 AM: Fishermen Cast-Off
1:00 PM: Weigh-In for Largest Fish Caught
1:30 PM – 4:30 PM: Ceremonies, Raffles, Cook-out and Live Music

In the first five years, the tournament has raised over $38,000.
“Our Stamford Hooks for Heroes is one of the most successful tournaments of its kind,” said Pat Buzzeo, event chair.
100% of all entry fees, sponsorships and donations will support the Disabled American Veterans Stamford Chapter 13’s Operation Gift Card project, which benefits patients and their families at Walter Reed National Military Medical Hospital.
The military men and women use these gift cards to buy items for their families from the Post Exchange.
“Stamford is the birthplace of Hooks for Heroes, a great event that brings our community together to support disabled veterans who have put America first,” said Richard Muskus Jr., Patriot Bank President. “Patriot Bank deeply and wholeheartedly supports America’s veterans and is incredibly honored to give back and support this local tournament.”
This year, with the support of Patriot Bank, more wounded veterans than in prior years will be able to make the trip from Walter Reed Military Hospital in Bethesda, MD.
Tournament participants will compete in two different fishing categories: largest bluefish and largest bass, both by weight. Local veterans, as well as patients on leave from Walter Reed, accompanied by their families will participate.
Watch a video of last year’s event here.

FDIC Coverage



FDIC Coverage
What does the MEMBER FDIC banner mean for you?
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent agency of the United States government that protects you against the loss of your deposits in the event that an FDIC insured bank or savings association fails. FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.
A financial institution must adhere to strict standards in order to earn this symbol of confidence.
Coverage Amounts and Eligibility
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act made permanent the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 per depositor. Coverage is automatic and there is no need for depositors to apply or to request FDIC insurance. The limit refers to the total of all deposits an account holder has at the bank.
All deposits made at Patriot Bank, N.A., including checking accounts, savings accounts, money markets and certificates of deposit accounts, are insured to FDIC limits. Depending upon how your deposit relationships are structured, your family can actually increase their coverage to several million dollars or more. Visit the FDIC website at www.myfdicinsurance.gov to calculate how best to maximize your coverage.
The FDIC does not insure money invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, insurance policies, annuities or municipal securities.

History[edit]
On August 31, 1994, Patriot National Bank obtained its charter and opened for business as a community bank. In 1999, Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. was organized as a Bank Holding Company headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut.
As the bank continued its evolution, Patriot National Statutory Trust I was founded On March 11, 2003 to issue trust preferred securities and invest the proceeds in subordinated debentures issued by the company.[9]
Patriot National Bank expanded its geographical footprint in 2006, when it purchased a branch office and opened two new branch offices in New York, helping it to expand into New York State.[10]
On February 26, 2013, the company announced the appointment of Kenneth T. Neilson as President and CEO owing to the resignation of Christopher Maher, the former President and CEO of the company.[11]
Under Neilson’s leadership, the bank reshaped its community focus, presence and commitment to provide commercial and consumer banking services in the areas it serves. As part of that effort, Patriot announced its new name “Patriot Bank” on September 28, 2015.[12]

History[edit]
On August 31, 1994, Patriot National Bank obtained its charter and opened for business as a community bank. In 1999, Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. was organized as a Bank Holding Company headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut.
As the bank continued its evolution, Patriot National Statutory Trust I was founded On March 11, 2003 to issue trust preferred securities and invest the proceeds in subordinated debentures issued by the company.[9]
Patriot National Bank expanded its geographical footprint in 2006, when it purchased a branch office and opened two new branch offices in New York, helping it to expand into New York State.[10]
On February 26, 2013, the company announced the appointment of Kenneth T. Neilson as President and CEO owing to the resignation of Christopher Maher, the former President and CEO of the company.[11]
Under Neilson’s leadership, the bank reshaped its community focus, presence and commitment to provide commercial and consumer banking services in the areas it serves. As part of that effort, Patriot announced its new name “Patriot Bank” on September 28, 2015.[12]

Live Banker ATMs are located in the following locations:

Community involvement[edit]
As part of its mission to ‘show by doing,’ Patriot Bank, N.A. regularly participates in and supports community-centric events in the areas it serves. This has included events and programs focused on small business, children needs, the homeless, arts and culture, professional development, human services, public and societal benefit and more.
One example is Patriot Bank’s funding for the restoration of Norwalk, Connecticut’s century-old Wall Street Theater.[13] Listed in the National Register of Historical Places, the former Globe Theater opened in 1915 as a vaudeville theater hosting some of the largest names in American entertainment at the time, including: Mary Pickford, John Barrymore, Lillian and Dorothy Gish, John Philip Sousa and more. The Wall Street Theater is the linchpin of a major inner-city redevelopment in Norwalk’s Wall Street Historic District and is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors when it opens in late 2016.

On September 4, 2015, the Fairfield County Business Journal, Westchester County Business Journal and Hearst Connecticut newspapers spotlighted Patriot’s growth under President & CEO Kenneth Neilson.

History[edit]
On August 31, 1994, Patriot National Bank obtained its charter and opened for business as a community bank. In 1999, Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. was organized as a Bank Holding Company headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut.
As the bank continued its evolution, Patriot National Statutory Trust I was founded On March 11, 2003 to issue trust preferred securities and invest the proceeds in subordinated debentures issued by the company.[9]
Patriot National Bank expanded its geographical footprint in 2006, when it purchased a branch office and opened two new branch offices in New York, helping it to expand into New York State.[10]
On February 26, 2013, the company announced the appointment of Kenneth T. Neilson as President and CEO owing to the resignation of Christopher Maher, the former President and CEO of the company.[11]
Under Neilson’s leadership, the bank reshaped its community focus, presence and commitment to provide commercial and consumer banking services in the areas it serves. As part of that effort, Patriot announced its new name “Patriot Bank” on September 28, 2015.[12]

Community involvement[edit]
As part of its mission to ‘show by doing,’ Patriot Bank, N.A. regularly participates in and supports community-centric events in the areas it serves. This has included events and programs focused on small business, children needs, the homeless, arts and culture, professional development, human services, public and societal benefit and more.
One example is Patriot Bank’s funding for the restoration of Norwalk, Connecticut’s century-old Wall Street Theater.[13] Listed in the National Register of Historical Places, the former Globe Theater opened in 1915 as a vaudeville theater hosting some of the largest names in American entertainment at the time, including: Mary Pickford, John Barrymore, Lillian and Dorothy Gish, John Philip Sousa and more. The Wall Street Theater is the linchpin of a major inner-city redevelopment in Norwalk’s Wall Street Historic District and is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors when it opens in late 2016.

Live Banker ATMs[edit]

Community involvement[edit]
As part of its mission to ‘show by doing,’ Patriot Bank, N.A. regularly participates in and supports community-centric events in the areas it serves. This has included events and programs focused on small business, children needs, the homeless, arts and culture, professional development, human services, public and societal benefit and more.
One example is Patriot Bank’s funding for the restoration of Norwalk, Connecticut’s century-old Wall Street Theater.[13] Listed in the National Register of Historical Places, the former Globe Theater opened in 1915 as a vaudeville theater hosting some of the largest names in American entertainment at the time, including: Mary Pickford, John Barrymore, Lillian and Dorothy Gish, John Philip Sousa and more. The Wall Street Theater is the linchpin of a major inner-city redevelopment in Norwalk’s Wall Street Historic District and is expected to attract tens of thousands of visitors when it opens in late 2016.
Recognition[edit]
On September 28, 2015, Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. was named a Sandler O’Neill Small Bank Sm-All-Star by investment and advisory firm Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Patriot was the only bank in New England to earn this distinction among the 435 publicly traded banks and thrifts evaluated.[14]
On January 9, 2012, M&A Advisory named Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. and Solaia Capital Advisors LLC as Finalists for the 6th Annual 2012 Middle Market Turnaround of the Year Award.[15]
In June 2004, Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. was named one of the 25 Best Public Companies in Connecticut by the Hartford Courant newspaper. The ranking was based on profits, growth, shareholders return, revenue increase and change in employment level.[16]
Media[edit]
On August 25, 2015, the company announced Castle Creek Capital joined its circle of institutional investors in PNBK Holdings.[17]
Connecticut-based Norwalk Hour chronicled Patriot Bank’s financing of the $7.5 million Wall Street Theater restoration project on September 25, 2015. Listed in the National Register of Historic Places, the 100-year old former vaudeville theater is being restored as a next-generation performance space that, in early 2016, will open debt free as a result of Patriot’s efforts.[13]
On September 4, 2015, the Fairfield County Business Journal, Westchester County Business Journal and Hearst Connecticut newspapers spotlighted Patriot’s growth under President & CEO Kenneth Neilson. In the article, Neilson discussed the strategy behind the bank’s turnaround and local community focus, which has resulted in eight quarters of increased earnings under his leadership.[18]
On September 28, 2015, the Hearst Connecticut newspapers and Greenwich Sentinel reported that Patriot National Bank has dropped its middle name to reflect the company’s focus on local banking services.[19]
On October 7, 2015, Patriot Bank celebrated the dedication of a new branch in Darien, CT, which includes a community event center with teleconferencing capabilities and a private bank atmosphere.[20]
On December 9, 2015, the American Banker featured Patriot Bank, N.A.’s leadership and interest in growth through possible small-bank acquisitions. CEO Kenneth Neilson told the magazine, “We’re looking for a good fit to jump-start our growth…It needs to geographically make sense.”[21]
On February 7, 2016, Patriot National Bancorp, Inc. expanded its stock ownership family by granting each of its employees, as of December 31, 2015, 100 shares of stock, ensuring that they have an even greater incentive in the success of the bank and exceeding its customer expectations.[22]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
