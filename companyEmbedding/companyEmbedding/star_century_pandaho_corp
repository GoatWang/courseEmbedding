	Forward-Looking Statements




	 



	This report includes “forward-looking
	statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), and
	Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements
	of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including any
	projections of earnings, revenue or other financial items, any statements regarding the plans and objectives of management for
	future operations, any statements concerning proposed new products or services, any statements regarding future economic conditions
	or performance, any statements regarding expected benefits from any transactions and any statements of assumptions underlying any
	of the foregoing. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as “may,”
	“will,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “potential”
	or “continue,” or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology. Although we believe that the expectations reflected
	in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations or any of the
	forward-looking statements will prove to be correct and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed
	in the forward-looking statements. Our future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements,
	are subject to inherent risk and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risk factors set forth in “Part II, Item
	1A – Risk Factors” below and for the reasons described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All forward
	looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this report are made as of the date hereof and we do not intend
	to update any forward-looking statements except as required by law or applicable regulations. Except where the context otherwise
	requires, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the “Company,” “Star Century Pandaho Corporation,”, “the
	Company ”, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Star Century Pandaho Corporation, a Nevada corporation.

	STAR CENTURY PANDAHO CORPORATION






	Notes to Condensed Financial Statements




	Nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016



	(Unaudited)


	 



	NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
	POLICIES



	 


	Star Century Pandaho Corporation ("the
	Company", “SCPD”) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 21, 2009. The Company was established
	as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization of AP Corporate Services, Inc. ("AP").


	 


	Pandaho the Panda is a cartoon styled character.
	On May 22, 2015, the Company secured certain licensing rights to the Pandaho character and brand though a licensing agreement with
	the creator of Pandaho, Ms. Liu Li. The Company’s aim is to build Pandaho into a competitive cartoon brand in China and surrounding
	areas with Pandaho-themed merchandise and multi-media exhibitions. Currently the Company does not have any operations in China.


	 



	Basis of presentation



	 


	The unaudited condensed financial statements
	of the Company for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting
	on Form 10-Q and Regulation S-K. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. However, such information reflects all adjustments
	(consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation
	of the financial position and the results of operations. Results shown for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the
	results to be obtained for a full fiscal year. The balance sheet information as of June 30, 2016 was derived from the audited financial
	statements included in the Company's financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 included in the Company’s
	Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 28, 2016. These
	financial statements should be read in conjunction with that report.


	 



	Going concern



	 


	The accompanying condensed financial statements
	have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
	of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended March 31, 2017, the Company incurred a net loss of
	$795,974 and used cash in operating activities of $24,511, and at March 31, 2017, had a stockholders’ deficiency of $678,078.
	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one
	year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in
	their report on the Company’s financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2016, expressed substantial doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s financial statements do not include any adjustments
	that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty should we be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The Company’s ability to continue as
	a going concern is dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of capital and to ultimately achieve profitable operations.
	Currently, the Company does not have significant cash or other material assets, nor does it have operations or a source of revenue
	sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. Over the next 12 months, the Company expects
	to expend up to approximately $50,000 for legal, accounting and administrative costs. The Company’s officers or principal
	shareholders have committed to making advances or loans to pay for these legal, accounting, and administrative costs. The Company
	has not yet determined the amount of cash that will be necessary to fund its planned operations in China.


	 


	The Company hopes to be able to attract suitable
	investors for our business plan, which will not require us to use our cash. No assurance can be given that any future financing
	will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company is able
	to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the
	case of debt financing or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in case or equity financing.

	Estimates



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include, among others, the accrual of potential liabilities, the assumptions
	used in valuing share-based instruments issued for services, and the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets.


	 



	Revenue



	 


	Revenue is recognized when the price is fixed
	or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been delivered, and collectability is reasonably
	assured. In transactions in which the Company brokers a sale and determines that it was not the primary obligor in the arrangement,
	the Company records as net the commission earned from the transaction.


	 



	Basic and Diluted loss per share



	 


	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
	net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted
	loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
	shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common
	shares had been issued. Diluted loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.


	 


	At March 31, 2017 and 2016, we excluded the outstanding securities
	summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of common stock as their effect would have been anti-dilutive:

	4,404,228


	 





	 



	Share-Based Compensation



	 


	The Company may periodically issue shares of
	common stock, stock options, or warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for
	financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative
	guidance provided by the FASB whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period.
	The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative
	guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a)
	the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity
	instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line
	basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately
	vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.


	 


	The fair value of the Company's common stock
	option grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest
	rates, expected volatility, expected life of the common stock options, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based
	upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the
	Black-Scholes option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

	Fair Value
	of Financial Instruments



	 


	Fair value is defined as the price that would
	be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
	the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated
	based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
	In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk including our own credit risk.


	 


	In addition to defining fair value, the standard
	expands the disclosure requirements around fair value and establishes a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs. The hierarchy
	prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the
	market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels which are determined by the lowest level input that
	is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:


	 


	Level 1 – inputs are based
	upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.


	Level 2 – inputs are based
	upon significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for identical or similar
	instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable
	in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.


	Level 3 – inputs are generally
	unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
	asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted
	cash flow models, and similar techniques.


	The estimated fair value of certain financial
	instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis,
	which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The recorded values of the convertible
	notes-related parties and non-redeemable convertible note approximates their fair values based upon their effective interest rates.


	 



	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

	ASU 2014-09 is
	a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current
	U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies
	recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require
	additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts,
	including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
	In addition, during 2016 the FASB has issued ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12, all of which clarify certain implementation
	guidance within ASU 2014-09, and ASU 2016-11, which rescinds certain SEC guidance effective upon an entity’s adoption of
	ASU 2014-09. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted
	only in annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. The standard can be adopted
	either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.
	The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company’s financial statements and
	disclosures.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

	Leases.

	ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance
	sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for
	capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in
	the financial statements, with certain practical expedients
	available. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could have on its financial statements and
	related disclosures.

	In March 2016, the FASB issued the ASU 2016-09,

	Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.

	The amendments in this ASU require, among other things, that all
	income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for
	an employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability
	accounting and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective
	for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
	for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could
	have on its financial statements and related disclosures.


	 


	Other recent accounting pronouncements issued
	by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities
	and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future
	consolidated financial statements.


	 



	NOTE 2. COMPENSATION AND ACCRUED COMPENSATION-RELATED
	PARTIES



	 


	Compensation-related party and accrued compensation-related
	party represent amounts recorded for employment contracts with three executives who are also shareholders, and a consulting agreement
	with another shareholder. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, total annual compensation for services was $396,000 (“cash
	compensation”), and the executives and shareholder have the option to accept shares of the Company’s common stock in
	lieu of cash based on a 50% discount to the average stock price, as defined. The option to accept shares of common stock in lieu
	of cash is accounted for at the fair value of the potentially issuable common shares and is subject to adjustment at each reporting
	date based on the change in market value of the shares.


	 


	On June 30, 2016, accrued compensation related
	to the three executives totaled $812,775. From July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, additional compensation expense of $567,342 was
	recorded, including $169,380 accrual of cash compensation, and a charge of $397,962 for the fair value that could be paid in shares
	of common stock. At December 31, 2016, accrued compensation due to the three executives totaled $1,380,117. Effective December
	31, 2016, the three executives agreed to forgive the $1,380,117, and to also terminate their employment agreements. Accordingly,
	at March 31, 2017, the total due to the three executives for accrued compensation was zero. The Company determined that based on
	the related party nature of the settlement, the gain on settlement of accrued compensation was treated as a capital contribution.


	 


	On June 30, 2016, accrued compensation due
	to the shareholder consultant was $105,290. During the nine months ended March 31, 2017, additional compensation of $121,668 was
	recorded, including $45,041 accrual of cash compensation due, and a charge of $76,627 for the fair value that could be paid in
	shares of common stock. At March 31, 2017, the accrued compensation due to the shareholder consultant was $226,958, which if the
	shareholder consultant elected to be paid in shares of common stock, would result in the issuance of 22,695,819 shares of the Company’s
	common stock.


	 



	NOTE 3. ADVANCES



	 


	The Company from time to time borrows from
	its principal shareholders, or others, to pay expenses such as filing fees, accounting fees and legal fees. These advances are
	non-interest bearing, unsecured, and generally due upon demand. At March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the Company was obligated

	added for the beneficial conversion feature on issuance of a convertible note payable, and $35,666 of discount was amortized and
	included in interest expense. At March 31, 2017, the unamortized discount on convertible notes is $4,276, and is to be amortized
	through December 2017

	.


	 



	NOTE 5. NON-REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE NOTE-RELATED
	PARTY



	 


	Non-redeemable convertible note-related party
	is secured by all the assets of the Company, accrues interest at 20% per annum, and is due August 1, 2017. The Company may prepay

	stock. At June 30, 2016, principal and accrued interest totaled $42,551. During the nine months ended March 31, 2017, interest
	of $629 was accrued and added to principal. At March 31, 2017, principal and accrued interest totaled $43,180 and are convertible
	into 863,600 shares of common stock. As it is the Company’s choice to convert the note into shares of the Company’s

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION
	AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017 AND 2016




	Company Overview



	 


	Star Century Pandaho Corporation (formerly
	Journal of Radiology, Inc.) (“SCPD” or "the Company") was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada
	on May 21, 2009. The Company was established as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization of AP Corporate Services, Inc. ("AP").
	Under AP's Plan of Reorganization, as confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, the Company
	was organized to own and develop a professional journal devoted to radiology.


	 


	On January 8, 2015, two shareholders of the
	Company agreed to sell an aggregate of 216,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing 53.66% of total outstanding
	shares at the time to Star Century Entertainment, Inc., an unrelated third party, and the Company experienced a change in control.
	In conjunction with the change in control, three individuals were elected to be the Company’s management, and the Company’s
	former President resigned. Effective January 16, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors and the majority shareholder amended
	the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to (i) change the name of the Company to Star Century Pandaho Corporation (ii) effect
	a 1-for-5,000 reverse common stock split and (iii) decrease the Company’s authorized common stock to 150,000,000 shares,
	par value $0.001.


	 


	On May 20, 2015, the Company’s Board
	of Directors and the majority shareholder amended the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to increase authorized common stock
	to 250,000,000 shares.


	 


	The Company’s headquarters are based
	in Las Vegas, Nevada with planned primary operation in Beijing, China. Our planned services, though to be offered globally, will
	initially be focused throughout China, surrounding Asia-Pacific countries, the United States and Canada. The Company’s business
	plan includes the establishment of officially licensed and professional operated fan clubs for celebrities and selected brands
	that will engage in event management, talent shows, brand and image licensing and associated product distribution, music festivals,
	and multi-media productions such as movies, television shows and web channel content.


	 


	Pandaho the Panda is a cartoon styled character.
	On May 22, 2015, the Company secured certain licensing rights to the Pandaho character and brand though a licensing agreement with
	the creator of Pandaho, Ms. Liu Li. The Company’s aim is to build Pandaho into a competitive cartoon brand in China and surrounding
	areas with Pandaho-themed merchandise and multi-media exhibitions. Currently the Company does not have any operations in China.


	 


	The Company is optimistic about the opportunity
	to utilize the Pandaho brand. The Panda image is a national treasure of China. The Company plans to develop and launch appropriate
	commercial, philanthropic and cultural activities as a part of the comprehensive brand development of Pandaho, the Panda. The Company
	believes that Pandaho, the Panda, brand is an excellent entry point for the implementation of the Company’s business plan.

	THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017 COMPARED
	TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016



	 



	REVENUE



	 


	For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and
	2016, we had $0 of revenue.


	 



	OPERATING COSTS



	 









	14

	 









	 






	Compensation includes salaries, stock-based
	compensation expenses and benefits paid and payable to three executives of the Company and a consultant/shareholder of the Company.
	Compensation expense was $29,589 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $195,288 for the three months ended March
	31, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of employment agreements, total annual compensation for services was $396,000. Effective December
	31, 2016, the three executives of the Company terminated their employment agreements that represented total annual compensation of $336,000. The
	executive or consultant/shareholder have the option to accept shares of the Company’s common stock in lieu of cash based
	on a 50% discount to the average stock price, as defined. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded $29,589
	of compensation expense related to these agreements, which included $14,795 for accrual of three months compensation due, and a
	charge of $14,794 for the fair value that could be paid in shares of common stock. The decrease in compensation expense is due
	in part to the termination of the employment agreements with the three executives and also to a decrease to the calculation of
	the fair value of shares that could be paid in shares of common stock due to a decrease in the price per share of the Company’s
	common stock.


	 


	General and Administrative expenses were $12,958
	for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $21,497 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Administration comprise
	accounting, audit, legal and transfer agent costs related to SEC compliance and investor relation expenses. The decrease in general
	and administrative expenses is primarily due to decrease in payroll taxes and consulting fees.


	 



	OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)



	 


	Other income (expense) includes interest expense
	of $10,410 and $30,262 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is due
	the debt discount on outstanding convertible notes being fully amortized.


	 



	NET LOSS



	 


	Our net losses for the three months ended March
	31, 2017 and 2016 was $52,957 and $247,047, respectively. Our losses decreased in the current year primarily because of decrease
	in compensation expense.


	 



	NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017 COMPARED
	TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2016



	 



	REVENUE



	 


	For the Nine months ended March 31, 2017 and
	2016, we had $0 of revenue.


	 



	OPERATING COSTS



	 


	Compensation includes salaries, stock-based
	compensation expenses and benefits paid and payable to three executives of the Company and a consultant/shareholder of the Company.
	Compensation expense was $689,010 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $877,896 for the nine months ended March
	31, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, total annual compensation for services is $396,000. Effective December 31,
	2016, the three executives of the Company terminated their employment agreements that represented total annual compensation of
	$336,000. The executive or consultant/shareholder have the option to accept shares of the Company’s common stock in lieu
	of cash based on a 50% discount to the average stock price, as defined. For the nine months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded
	$689,010 of compensation expense related to these agreements, which included $214,422 for accrual of nine months compensation due,
	and a charge of $474,588 for the fair value that could be paid in shares of common stock. The decrease in compensation expense
	is due in part to the termination of the employment agreements with the three executives and also to a decrease to the calculation
	of the fair value of shares that could be paid in shares of common stock due to a decrease in the price per share of the Company’s
	common stock.


	 


	General and Administrative expenses were $57,595
	for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $123,484 for the nine months ended March 31, 2016. Administration comprise
	accounting, audit, legal and transfer agent costs related to SEC compliance and investor relation expenses. The decrease in general
	and administrative expenses is primarily due to decrease in payroll taxes and consulting fees.


	 



	OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)



	 







	15

	 









	 






	Other income (expense) includes interest expense
	of $49,369 and $72,679 for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is due
	the debt discount on outstanding convertible notes being fully amortized.


	 



	NET LOSS



	 


	Our net losses for the nine months ended March
	31, 2017 and 2016 was $795,974 and $1,074,059, respectively. Our losses decreased in the current year primarily because of decrease
	in compensation expense.


	 



	LIQUIDITY



	 


	As of March 31, 2017, we had cash of $8,582
	and total liabilities of $688,327. Our current cash balance and cash flow from operating activities will not be sufficient to fund
	our operations.


	 


	The Company’s condensed financial statements
	have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
	of liabilities in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended March 31, 2017, the Company incurred a net loss of
	$795,974 and used cash in operating activities of $24,511, and at March 31, 2017, had a stockholders’ deficiency of $678,078.
	These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one
	year of the date that the financial statements are issued. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in
	their report on the Company’s financial statements for the year ending June 30, 2016, expressed substantial doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s financial statements do not include any adjustments
	that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty should we be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The Company’s ability to continue as
	a going concern is dependent upon its ability to develop additional sources of capital and to ultimately achieve profitable operations.
	Currently, the Company does not have significant cash or other material assets, nor does it have operations or a source of revenue
	sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue as a going concern. Over the next 12 months, the Company expects
	to expend up to approximately $50,000 for legal, accounting and administrative costs. The Company’s officers or principal
	shareholders have committed to making advances or loans to pay for these legal, accounting, and administrative costs. The Company
	has not yet determined the amount of cash that will be necessary to fund its planned operations in China.


	 


	We hope to be able to attract suitable investors
	for our business plan. The inability to obtain financing or generate sufficient cash from operations could require us to reduce
	or eliminate expenditures or otherwise curtail or discontinue our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our
	business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the
	sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders.
	If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences and privileges
	senior to holders of our common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. Regardless of whether
	our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate providers of services by issuing
	stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders.


	 



	OPERATING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
	REQUIREMENTS



	 


	Our controlling shareholders expect to advance
	us additional funding for operating costs in order to implement our business plan. The funds are loaned to the Company as required
	to pay amounts owed by the Company. As such, our operating capital is currently limited to the resources of our controlling shareholders.
	The loans from our controlling shareholders are unsecured and non-interest bearing and have no set terms of repayment. We anticipate
	receiving additional capital once we are able to have our securities actively trading on a public exchange. There is no guarantee
	our stock will develop a market on that public exchange.


	 



	PLAN OF OPERATION
	AND FUNDING








	16

	 









	 






	We do not currently engage
	in enough business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next
	12 months and beyond such time will be paid with amounts to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other
	investors.


	      During
	the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:


	      (i)
	filing of Exchange Act reports, and


	      (ii)
	costs relating to developing our business plan


	We believe we will be able to meet these costs
	through amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.



	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.



	Critical Accounting Policies



	 


	Revenue


	 


	Revenue is recognized when the price is fixed
	or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been delivered, and collectability is reasonably
	assured. In transactions in which the Company brokers a sale and determines that it was not the primary obligor in the arrangement,
	the Company records as net the commission earned from the transaction.


	 


	Share-Based Compensation:


	 


	The Company may periodically issue stock options
	and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company
	accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the
	FASB whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts
	for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB
	whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance
	commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee
	stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances
	where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based
	compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.


	 


	The fair value of the Company's common stock
	option grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest
	rates, expected volatility, expected life of the common stock options, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based
	upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the
	Black-Scholes option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

	As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer evaluated our company's disclosure controls
	and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this
	report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of the end
	of the period covered by this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information
	required to be disclosed by our company in reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed,
	summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission and to ensure
	that such information is accumulated and communicated to our company's management, including our principal executive officer and
	principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	The conclusion that our disclosure controls
	and procedures were not effective was due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in internal control over financial
	reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk
	assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements
	and application of both United States generally accepted accounting principles and Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.
	Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be effective until the material weaknesses are remediated. 


	 


	We plan to take steps to enhance and improve
	the design of our internal controls over financial reporting. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q,
	we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement
	the following changes during our fiscal year ending June 30, 2017, subject to obtaining additional financing: (i) appoint additional
	qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written
	policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting. The remediation efforts set out above are largely dependent upon
	our securing additional financing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such
	funds, remediation efforts may be adversely affected in a material manner.




	Changes in Internal Control over
	Financial Reporting




	There were no changes in our internal
	control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely
	to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015  Company Overview  Star Century Pandaho Corporation (formerly Journal of Radiology, Inc.) ("SCPD" or "the Company") was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 21, 2009. The Company was established as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization of AP Corporate Services, Inc. ("AP"). Under AP's Plan of Reorganization, as confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, the Company was organized to own and develop a professional journal devoted to radiology.  On January 8, 2015, two shareholders of the Company agreed to sell an aggregate of 216,000 shares of the Company's common stock, representing 53.66% of total outstanding shares at the time to Star Century Entertainment, Inc., an unrelated third party, and the Company experienced a change in control. In conjunction with the change in control, three individuals were elected to be the Company's management, and the Company's former President resigned. Effective January 16, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors and the majority shareholder amended the Company's Articles of Incorporation to (i) change the name of the Company to Star Century Pandaho Corporation (ii) effect a 1-for-5,000 reverse common stock split and (iii) decrease the Company's authorized common stock to 150,000,000 shares, par value $0.001.  On May 20, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors and the majority shareholder amended the Company's Articles of Incorporation to increase authorized common stock to 250,000,000 shares.  The Company's headquarters are based in Las Vegas, Nevada with planned primary operation in Beijing, China. Our planned services, though to be offered globally, will initially be focused throughout China, surrounding Asia-Pacific countries, the United States and Canada. The Company's business plan includes the establishment of officially licensed and professional operated fan clubs for celebrities and selected brands that will engage in event management, talent shows, brand and image licensing and associated product distribution, music festivals, and multi-media productions such as movies, television shows and web channel content.  Pandaho the Panda is a cartoon styled character. On May 22, 2015, the Company secured certain licensing rights to the Pandaho character and brand though a licensing agreement with the creator of Pandaho, Ms. Liu Li. The Company's aim is to build Pandaho into a competitive cartoon brand in China and surrounding areas with Pandaho-themed merchandise and multi-media exhibitions. Currently the Company does not have any operations in China.  The Company is optimistic about the opportunity to utilize the Pandaho brand. The Panda image is a national treasure of China. The Company plans to develop and launch appropriate commercial, philanthropic and cultural activities as a part of the comprehensive brand development of Pandaho, the Panda. The Company believes that Pandaho, the Panda, brand is an excellent entry point for the implementation of the Company's business plan.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  REVENUE  For the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $0 of revenue.  OPERATING COSTS  Compensation includes salaries, stock-based compensation expenses and benefits paid and payable to three executives of the Company and a shareholder of the Company. Compensation was $199,627 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $408,888 for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of employment agreements, total annual compensation for services was $396,000. The executive or shareholder have the option to accept shares of the Company's common stock in lieu of cash based on a 50% discount to the average stock price, as defined. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $199,627 of compensation related to these agreements, which included $99,814 for accrual of three months compensation, with the balance reflecting an expense for the value that could be paid in shares of common stock. The decrease in compensation is due to the part of the compensation determined by the 50% discount to the average stock price, as defined, which decreased during the period. At December 31, 2016, accrued compensation due to the three executives totaled $1,329,272 and related accrued payroll taxes were $50,845, or an aggregate of $1,380,117. Effective December 31, 2016, the three executives agreed to forgive the aggregate of $1,380,117, and to also terminate their employment agreements. The Company determined that based on the related party nature of the settlement, the gain on settlement of accrued compensation was treated as a capital contribution.  General and Administrative expenses were $18,502 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $36,877 for the three months ended December 31, 2015. Administration comprise accounting, audit, legal and transfer agent costs related to SEC compliance and investor relation expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to decrease in payroll taxes and consulting fees.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  Other income (expense) includes interest expense of $13,179 and $27,406 for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is due the debt discount on outstanding convertible notes being fully amortized.  NET LOSS  Our net losses for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $231,308 and $473,171, respectively. Our losses decreased in the current year primarily because of decrease in compensation expense.  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  REVENUE  For the Six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $0 of revenue.  OPERATING COSTS  Compensation includes salaries, stock-based compensation expenses and benefits paid and payable to three executives of the Company and a shareholder of the Company. Compensation was $659,421 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $913,055 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, total annual compensation for services is $396,000. The executive or shareholder have the option to accept shares of the Company's common stock in lieu of cash based on a 50% discount to the average stock price, as defined. For the six months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $659,421 of compensation related to these agreements, which included $199,627 for accrual of six months compensation, with the balance reflecting an expense for the value that could be paid in shares of common stock. The decrease in compensation is due to the part of the compensation determined by the 50% discount to the average stock price, as defined, which decreased during the period. At December 31, 2016, the three executives agreed to terminate their employment agreements.  General and Administrative expenses were $44,637 for the six months ended December 31, 2016, compared to $101,988 for the six months ended December 31, 2015. Administration comprise accounting, audit, legal and transfer agent costs related to SEC compliance and investor relation expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to decrease in payroll taxes and consulting fees.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  Other income (expense) includes interest expense of $38,959 and $42,417 for the Six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is due the debt discount on outstanding convertible notes being fully amortized.  NET LOSS  Our net losses for the Six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $743,017 and $1,057,460, respectively. Our losses decreased in the current year primarily because of decrease in compensation expense.  LIQUIDITY  As of December 31, 2016, we had cash of $4,188 and total liabilities of $633,476. Our current cash balance and cash flow from operating activities will not be sufficient to fund our operations.  The Company's financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, for the six months ended December 31, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $743,017 and used cash in operating activities of $18,905, and at December 31, 2016, had a working capital deficiency of $581,941 and stockholders' deficiency of $625,121. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our June 30, 2016 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  We expect to be able to secure capital through advances from our officers or principal shareholders in order to pay expenses such as filing fees, accounting fees and legal fees. Over the next 12 months, the Company expects to expend approximately $50,000 for such filing fees, accounting fees and legal fees. The Company has not yet determined the amount of cash that will be necessary to fund its planned operations in China. We hope to be able to attract suitable investors for our business plan. The inability to obtain financing or generate sufficient cash from operations could require us to reduce or eliminate expenditures or otherwise curtail or discontinue our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate providers of services by issuing stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders.  OPERATING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS  Our controlling shareholders expect to advance us additional funding for operating costs in order to implement our business plan. The funds are loaned to the Company as required to pay amounts owed by the Company. As such, our operating capital is currently limited to the resources of our controlling shareholders. The loans from our controlling shareholders are unsecured and non-interest bearing and have no set terms of repayment. We anticipate receiving additional capital once we are able to have our securities actively trading on a public exchange. There is no guarantee our stock will develop a market on that public exchange.  PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING  We do not currently engage in enough business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with amounts to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.  During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:  (i) filing of Exchange Act reports, and  (ii) costs relating to developing our business plan  We believe we will be able to meet these costs through amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  Critical Accounting Policies  Revenue  Revenue is recognized when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been delivered, and collectability is reasonably assured. In transactions in which the Company brokers a sale and determines that it was not the primary obligor in the arrangement, the Company records as net the commission earned from the transaction.  Share-Based Compensation:  The Company may periodically issue stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the FASB whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.  The fair value of the Company's common stock option grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the common stock options, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

	Forward-Looking Information



	 


	Much of the discussion in this Item is “forward
	looking”.  Actual operations and results may materially differ from present plans and projections due to changes in
	economic conditions, new business opportunities, changed business conditions, and other developments.  Other factors that
	could cause results to differ materially are described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


	 


	There are several factors that could cause
	actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated, and include, but are not limited to, general economic, financial
	and business conditions, changes in and compliance with governmental laws and regulations, including various state and federal
	environmental regulations, our ability to obtain additional financing from outside investors and/or bank and mezzanine lenders,
	and our ability to generate sufficient revenues to cover operating losses and position us to achieve positive cash flow.

	ITEM 1.	BUSINESS.



	Company Overview



	 


	Star Century Pandaho Corporation (“the
	Company”) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 21, 2009. The Company was established as part of the
	Chapter 11 reorganization of AP Corporate Services, Inc. ("AP").


	 


	On January 8, 2015, two shareholders of the
	Company agreed to sell an aggregate of 216,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing 53.66% of total outstanding
	shares to Star Century Entertainment, Inc., an unrelated third party, and the Company experienced a change in control. In conjunction
	with the change in control, three individuals were elected to be the Company’s management, and the Company’s former
	President resigned. Effective January 16, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors and the majority shareholder amended the
	Company’s Articles of Incorporation to (i) change the name of the Company to Star Century Pandaho Corporation (ii) effect
	a 1-for-5,000 reverse common stock split and (iii) decrease the Company’s authorized common stock to 150,000,000 shares,
	par value $0.001. On May 20, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors and the majority shareholder amended the Company’s
	Articles of Incorporation to increase authorized common stock to 250,000,000 shares.


	 


	The Company’s headquarters are based
	in Las Vegas, Nevada with planned primary operation in Beijing, China. Our planned services, though to be offered globally, will
	initially be focused throughout China, surrounding Asia-Pacific countries, the United States and Canada. The Company’s business
	plan includes the establishment of officially licensed and professional fan clubs for celebrities and selected brands that will
	engage in event management, talent shows, brand and image licensing and associated product distribution, music festivals, and multi-media
	productions such as movies, television shows and web channel content. Pandaho the Panda is a cartoon styled character. Within our
	planned services we also intend to utilize our license rights to the character and brand Pandaho, not only for the above referenced
	activities but also for Pandaho (Panda) themed areas as well as branding, toys, art, entertainment and e-commerce.


	 


	The Company is optimistic about the opportunity
	to utilize the Pandaho brand. The associated Panda image is a national treasure of China. The Company plans to develop and launch
	appropriate commercial, philanthropic and cultural activities as a part of the comprehensive brand development of Pandaho, the
	Panda. The Company believes that Pandaho, the Panda, brand is an excellent entry point for the implementation of the Company’s
	business plan.

	Cooperation Agreement



	 


	On November 1, 2015, the Company entered into
	a cooperation agreement with Pisona Tour Company Limited (“Pisona”) that outlines the intentions of the Company and
	Pisona in relation to Patong Bay Hill, a master planned community and hotel being developed in Thailand by Pisona. Under the agreement,
	the Company has agreed to allow Pisona to use the “Pandaho” trademark as the hotel’s mascot, and to sell “Pandaho”
	products under a license agreement to be negotiated. The agreement has an initial term of five years. At June 30, 2016, the Company
	and Pisona have not engaged in any licensed product activity.

	ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.




	 




	An investment
	in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding to
	purchase shares of our common stock. If any of the events, contingencies, circumstances or conditions described in the risks below
	actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed.




	 




	RISK FACTORS CONCERNING OUR BUSINESS



	 




	Our business is subject to numerous risk factors, including
	the following:






	 






	The Company's independent registered public accounting firm
	have issued a report questioning the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.




	 


	Primarily as a result of our recurring losses
	and our lack of liquidity, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on our financial
	statements for the year ending June 30, 2016, expressed substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
	concern. We anticipate incurring losses in the foreseeable future. We do not have an established source of revenue sufficient to
	cover our operating costs. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to successfully compete, operate
	profitably and/or raise additional capital through other means. If we are unable to reverse our losses, we will have to discontinue
	operations.


	 




	We have had little operating history and no revenues or earnings
	from operations.






	 




	We will, in all likelihood, sustain operating
	expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until we begin to generate revenue from new plan of operations. This may result
	in us incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until we can generate revenues or raise additional capital
	through other means. There is no assurance that we can identify such a business entity and consummate such an agreement or combination.


	 


	We do not have significant cash or other material
	assets and we are relying on advances from stockholders, officers and directors to meet our limited operating expenses. We may
	become insolvent if we are unable to pay our debts in the ordinary course of business as they become due.




	 






	Our proposed plan of operation is speculative.






	 








	 



	5



	 







	 




	Our proposed plan of operation strategy depends
	in large part on our ability to build a robust platform of official and professional fan clubs for the celebrities. We may not
	be able to enter into a substantial number of contracts that we anticipate would be necessary to support our business model.


	 

	 





	There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
	enhance its products or services, or develop other products or services.






	 




	If we are unable to achieve profitability in
	the future, recruit sufficient personnel or raise money in the future, our ability to develop our services would be adversely affected.
	Our inability to develop our services or develop new services, in view of rapidly changing technology, changing customer demands
	and competitive pressures, would have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.




	 






	Our principal shareholder will be able
	to approve all corporate actions without shareholder consent and will control our Company.






	 




	On January 8, 2015, Star Century Entertainment,
	Inc. owned 53.66% of the Company’s total outstanding shares of common stock. In May and June 2015, the Company issued approximately
	67.9 million shares of common stock for the licensing of the Pandaho intellectual property and for various services. After the
	issuance of shares, Star Century Entertainment, Inc. owned less than 1% of our Common Stock. On September 4, 2015, the Board of
	Directors designated 100,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.01. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock has the
	voting power of 5,000 common shares. On September 8, 2015, the Company issued 25,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock to Star
	Century Entertainment Inc. that will have voting power of 125,000,000 common shares and will have significant influence over all
	matters requiring approval by our shareholders, but not requiring the approval of the minority shareholders. Because it will have
	the majority of voting rights, it will be able to elect all of the members of our board of directors, allowing it to exercise significant
	control of our affairs and management. In addition, it may transact most corporate matters requiring shareholder approval by written
	consent, without a duly-noticed and duly-held meeting of shareholders.


	 




	The reporting requirements under federal
	securities law may delay or prevent us from making certain acquisitions.






	 




	Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, as amended, (the "1934 Act"), require companies subject thereto to provide certain information about significant
	acquisitions, including certified financial statements for the company acquired, covering one, two, or three years, depending on
	the relative size of the acquisition. The time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare such
	statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by the Company. Acquisition
	prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may not be appropriate for acquisition so long
	as the reporting requirements of the 1934 Act are applicable.


	 


	In addition to the audited financial statements,
	the time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare and disclose such information may significantly
	delay or essentially preclude consummation of an otherwise desirable acquisition by the Company.




	 






	An acquisition could create a situation wherein we would be
	required to register under The Investment Company Act of 1940 and thus be required to incur substantial additional costs and expenses.






	 




	Although we will be subject to regulation under
	the 1934 Act, management believes the Company will not be subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, insofar
	as we will not be engaged in the business of investing or trading in securities. In the event we engage in a business combination
	that results in us holding passive investment interests in a number of entities, we could be subject to regulation under the Investment
	Company Act of 1940. In such event, we would be required to register as an investment company and could be expected to incur significant
	registration and compliance costs. We have obtained no formal determination from the Securities and Exchange Commission as to the
	status of our Company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and, consequently, any violation of such Act would subject us to
	material adverse consequences.




	 








	 



	6



	 







	 






	The requirement of audited financial
	statements may disqualify some business opportunities seeking a business combination with us.






	 








	Our management believes that
	any potential business combination opportunity must provide audited financial statements for review, for the protection of all
	parties to the business combination. One or more attractive business opportunities may choose to forego the possibility of a business
	combination with us, rather than incur the expenses associated with preparing audited financial statements. 


	 




	If our Common Stock does not meet blue
	sky resale requirements, certain shareholders may be unable to resell our Common Stock.






	 




	The resale of Common Stock must meet the blue
	sky resale requirements in the states in which the proposed purchasers reside. If we are unable to qualify the Common Stock and
	there is no exemption from qualification in certain states, the holders of the Common Stock or the purchasers of the Common Stock
	may be unable to sell them.




	 






	Our shareholders may face significant
	restrictions on the resale of our Common Stock due to state "blue sky" laws or if we are determined to be a "blank
	check" company.






	 




	There are state regulations that may adversely
	affect the transferability of our Common Stock. We have not registered our Common Stock for resale under the securities or "blue
	sky" laws of any state. We may seek qualification or advise our shareholders of the availability of an exemption. We are under
	no obligation to register or qualify our Common Stock in any state or to advise the shareholders of any exemptions.


	 


	Current shareholders, and persons who desire
	to purchase the Common Stock in any trading market that may develop in the future, should be aware that there might be significant
	state restrictions upon the ability of new investors to purchase the Common Stock. 


	Blue sky laws, regulations, orders, or interpretations
	place limitations on offerings or sales of securities by "blank check" companies or in "blind-pool" offerings,
	or if such securities represent "cheap stock" previously issued to promoters or others. Our former CEO, because he received
	stock at a price of $.001 for each share, may be deemed to hold "cheap stock." These limitations typically provide, in
	the form of one or more of the following limitations that such securities are:


	 


	(a) Not eligible for sale
	under exemption provisions permitting sales without registration to accredited investors or qualified purchasers;


	 


	(b) Not eligible for the
	transaction exemption from registration for non-issuer transactions by a registered broker-dealer;


	 


	(c) Not eligible for registration
	under the simplified small corporate offering registration (SCOR) form available in many states;


	 


	(d) Not eligible for the
	"solicitations of interest" exception to securities registration requirements available in many states;


	 


	(e) Not permitted to be
	registered or exempted from registration, and thus not permitted to be sold in the state under any circumstances.


	 


	Virtually all 50 states have adopted one or
	more of these limitations, or other limitations or restrictions affecting the sale or resale of stock of blank check companies
	or securities sold in "blind pool" offerings or "cheap stock" issued to promoters or others. Specific limitations
	on such offerings have been adopted in:


	 







	Alaska                         




	Nevada  




	Tennessee

	Any secondary trading market which may develop
	may only be conducted in those jurisdictions where an applicable exemption is available or where the shares have been registered.


	 


	Current shareholders and persons who desire
	to purchase the Common Stock in any trading market that may develop in the future, should be aware that we are under no obligation
	to register the shares on behalf of our shareholders under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.


	 


	The Company's officers, directors and majority
	shareholders have expressed their intentions not to engage in any transactions with respect to the Company's Common Stock except
	in connection with or following a business combination resulting in us no longer being defined as a blank check issuer. Any transactions
	in our Common Stock by said shareholders will require compliance with the registration requirements under the Securities Act of
	1933, as amended.




	 






	Our Common Stock may be subject to significant
	restriction on resale due to federal penny stock restrictions.






	 




	The Securities and Exchange Commission has
	adopted rules that regulate broker or dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks generally
	are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges
	or quoted on the Nasdaq system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities
	is provided by the exchange system). The penny stock rules require a broker or dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock
	not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the Securities and Exchange
	Commission that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker
	or dealer also must provide the customer with bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker or dealer,
	and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the
	customer's account. The penny stock rules also require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from such
	rules, the broker or dealer must make a special written determination that a penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser
	and receive the purchaser's written agreement to the transaction.


	 


	These disclosure requirements may have the
	effect of reducing the level of trading activity in any secondary market for our stock that becomes subject to the penny stock
	rules, and accordingly, shareholders of our Common Stock may find it difficult to sell their securities, if at all.

	Our
	common stock is quoted under the symbol “SCPD” on the OTCBB operated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
	Inc. (“FINRA”) and the OTCQB operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc.

	 

	Few
	market makers continue to participate in the OTCBB system because of high fees charged by FINRA.  Consequently, market makers
	that once quoted our shares on the OTCBB system may no longer be posting a quotation for our shares. As of the date of this report,
	however, our shares are quoted by several market makers on the OTCQB. The criteria for listing on either the OTCBB or OTCQB are
	similar and include that we remain current in our SEC reporting.



	 


	Only a limited market exists for our securities.
	There is no assurance that a regular trading market will develop, or if developed, that it will be sustained. Therefore, a shareholder
	may be unable to resell his securities in our company.


	 


	The following tables set forth the range of
	high and low prices for our common stock for the each of the periods indicated as reported by the OTCQB. These quotations reflect
	inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.

	Penny Stock



	 


	The SEC has adopted rules that regulate
	broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a
	market price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the
	NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided
	by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock, to deliver
	a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC, that: (a) contains a description of the nature and level of risk
	in the market for penny stocks in both public offerings and secondary trading; (b) contains a description of the broker's or
	dealer's duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation of such
	duties or other requirements of the securities laws; (c) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market,
	including bid and ask prices for penny stocks and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (d) contains
	a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions; (e) defines significant terms in the disclosure document
	or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks; and (f) contains such other information and is in such form, including
	language, type size and format, as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation.

	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.



	Star Century Pandaho Corporation (formerly
	Journal of Radiology, Inc.) (“SCPD” or "the Company") was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada
	on May 21, 2009. The Company was established as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization of AP Corporate Services, Inc. ("AP").
	Under AP's Plan of Reorganization, as confirmed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, the Company
	was organized to own and develop a professional journal devoted to radiology.


	 


	On January 8, 2015, two shareholders of the
	Company agreed to sell an aggregate of 216,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, representing 53.66% of total outstanding
	shares at the time to Star Century Entertainment, Inc., an unrelated third party, and the Company experienced a change in control.
	In conjunction with the change in control, three individuals were elected to be the Company’s management, and the Company’s
	former President resigned. Effective January 16, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors and the majority shareholder amended
	the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to (i) change the name of the Company to Star Century Pandaho Corporation (ii) effect
	a 1-for-5,000 reverse common stock split and (iii) decrease the Company’s authorized common stock to 150,000,000 shares,
	par value $0.001.


	 


	On May 20, 2015, the Company’s Board
	of Directors and the majority shareholder amended the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to increase authorized common stock
	to 250,000,000 shares.


	 


	The Company’s headquarters are based
	in Las Vegas, Nevada with planned primary operation in Beijing, China. Our planned services, though to be offered globally, will
	initially be focused throughout China, surrounding Asia-Pacific countries, the United States and Canada. The Company’s business
	plan includes the establishment of officially licensed and professional operated fan clubs for celebrities and selected brands
	that will engage in event management, talent shows, brand and image licensing and associated product distribution, music festivals,
	and multi-media productions such as movies, television shows and web channel content. Within our planned services we also intend
	to utilize our license rights to the character and brand Pandaho, not only for the above referenced activities but also for Pandaho
	(Panda) themed areas as well branding, toys, art, entertainment and e-commerce.


	 


	Pandaho the Panda is a cartoon styled character
	developed by Ms. Liu Li that is quickly growing in popularity and recognition throughout the global Chinese community.


	 


	On May 22, 2015, the Company issued 40,000,000
	shares of common stock to Lui Li as payment for the non-exclusive licensing rights in the “Pandaho” brand and other
	related names and products. Immediately after the transaction Lui Li held 61.5% of the outstanding common stock of the Company.
	Based on Li’s 61.5% ownership percentage in the Company at the time, Li in substance controlled the Pandaho intellectual
	property directly before and after the purchase of the Pandaho IP by the Company. Given this, the value of the intellectual property
	recorded at the date of acquisition was carried over at the historical cost to Li of zero.


	 


	The Company is optimistic about the
	opportunity to utilize the Pandaho brand. The Panda image is a national treasure of China. The Company plans to develop and
	launch appropriate commercial, philanthropic and cultural activities as a part of the comprehensive brand development of
	Pandaho, the Panda. The Company believes that Pandaho, the Panda, brand is an excellent entry point for the implementation of
	the Company’s business plan.

	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 


	The preparation of our consolidated financial
	statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates
	and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities. When making these estimates and assumptions, we consider our historical experience, our knowledge of economic
	and market factors and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ
	under different estimates and assumptions.


	 


	The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed
	in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they
	inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties.


	 


	REVENUE


	 


	Revenue is recognized when the price is fixed
	or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been delivered, and collectability is reasonably
	assured. In transactions in which the Company brokers a sale and determines that it was not the primary obligor in the arrangement,
	the Company records as net the commission earned from the transaction.


	 


	STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION


	 


	The Company may periodically issue stock options
	and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for financing costs. The Company
	accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by the
	FASB whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized over the vesting period. The Company accounts
	for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB
	whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance
	commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Non-employee
	stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. In certain circumstances
	where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based
	compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.


	 


	The fair value of the Company's common stock
	option grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest
	rates, expected volatility, expected life of the common stock options, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based
	upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the
	Black-Scholes option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

	FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 COMPARED
	TO THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015



	 



	RELATED PARTY COMMISSION REVENUE



	 


	For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and
	2015, we had $0 and $50,000 of commission revenue, respectively for the sales of plush toys.


	 


	In May 2015, the Company sold 2,000
	Pandaho themed products to an unrelated party, Beijing Rui He Jia Ye International for $100,000, and purchased the 2,000
	Pandaho themed products from Beijing Yishengyuankai Culture Co., a company wholly owned by Li Lui, at a cost of $50,000. The
	Company determined that it was an agent and not the primary obligor in the arrangement and recorded the transaction as a net
	commission revenue of $50,000. There were no such transactions for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.

	OPERATING COSTS



	 


	Compensation includes salaries, stock-based
	compensation expenses and benefits paid and payable to three executives of the Company and a shareholder of the Company. Compensation
	was $751,830 for the year ended June 30, 2016, compared to $159,255 for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in compensation
	is due to employment contracts with three executives and a consulting agreement with a shareholder entered into during May 2015.
	Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, total annual compensation for services is $396,000. The executive or shareholder have
	the option to accept shares of the Company’s common stock in lieu of cash based on a 50% discount to the average stock price,
	as defined. For the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded $751,830 of compensation related to these agreements, which
	included $396,000 for accrual of annual compensation, with the balance reflecting an expense for the value that could be paid in
	shares of common stock.


	 


	General and Administrative expenses were $249,555
	for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, compared to $3,608,940 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Administration comprise
	accounting, audit, legal and transfer agent costs related to SEC compliance, stock based compensation issued for services, and
	investor relation expenses. The decrease in administration expense is due to a decrease in stock based compensation issued for
	services. Stock-based compensation was $153,993 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, compared to $3,375,000 for the fiscal
	year ended June 30, 2015. During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company issued 256,441 shares of common stock valued at $153,993
	for consulting services. During the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company issued 4,200,000 shares of common stock valued at $1,290,000
	for consulting services, 650,000 shares of common stock valued at $195,000 to three executives as signing bonuses, and 3,000,000
	shares of common stock valued at $1,890,000 to a consultant for services. The Company also recorded $1,000,000 expense related
	to the difference between the total fair value of the 20,000,000 shares of common stock issued and the face amount of a note receivable
	received in consideration for the shares of $5,000,000. There were no such transactions for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.


	 



	OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)



	 


	Other income (expense) includes interest expense
	of $183,504 and $30,602 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase related to $65,000 loss on settlement
	of debt and increased interest expense in fiscal 2016 related to new convertible notes issued in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal
	2015.


	 


	On September 8, 2015, the Company issued 25,000
	shares of Series B Preferred Stock in exchange for $44,787 due to Star Century Entertainment Corporation, a related party. The
	fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock was determined to be $109,787. The difference of $65,000 is recorded as a loss on settlement
	of debt in the statement of operations.


	 



	NET LOSS



	 


	Our net losses for the year ended June 30,
	2016 and 2015 was $1,184,889 and $4,748,797, respectively. Our losses decreased in the current year primarily because of a decrease
	in stock-based compensation expense.


	 



	LIQUIDITY



	 


	As of June 30, 2016, we had cash of $920 and
	total liabilities of $1,277,308. Our current cash balance and cash flow from operating activities will not be sufficient to fund
	our operations.


	 


	The Company's financial statements are
	prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and
	commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, for the year ended June
	30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $1,184,889 and used cash in operating activities of $96,860, and at June 30, 2016,
	had a working capital deficiency of $1,129,920 and stockholders’ deficiency of $1,267,221. These factors, among others,
	raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s independent registered public
	accounting firm, in its report on our June 30, 2016 financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the
	Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	We expect to be able to secure capital through
	advances from our officers or principal shareholders in order to pay expenses such as filing fees, accounting fees and legal fees.
	Over the next 12 months, the Company expects to expend approximately $60,000 for such filing fees, accounting fees and legal fees.
	The Company has not yet determined the amount of cash that will be necessary to fund its planned operations in China. We hope to
	be able to attract suitable investors for our business plan. The inability to obtain financing or generate sufficient cash from
	operations could require us to reduce or eliminate expenditures or otherwise curtail or discontinue our operations, which could
	have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, to the extent that
	we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities may result
	in dilution to existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may
	have rights, preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions
	on our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate
	providers of services by issuing stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders.


	 



	OPERATING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
	REQUIREMENTS



	 


	Our controlling shareholders expect to advance
	us additional funding for operating costs in order to implement our business plan. The funds are loaned to the Company as required
	to pay amounts owed by the Company. As such, our operating capital is currently limited to the resources of our controlling shareholders.
	The loans from our controlling shareholders are unsecured and non-interest bearing and have no set terms of repayment. We anticipate
	receiving additional capital once we are able to have our securities actively trading on a public exchange. There is no guarantee
	our stock will develop a market on that public exchange.


	 



	PLAN OF OPERATION
	AND FUNDING



	We do not currently engage
	in enough business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next
	12 months and beyond such time will be paid with amounts to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other
	investors.


	      During
	the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to:


	      (i)
	filing of Exchange Act reports, and


	      (ii)
	costs relating to developing our business plan


	 


	We believe we will be able to meet these costs
	through amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.

	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures




	As required by Rule 13a-15 under the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
	as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, being June 30, 2016. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision
	and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.


	 


	Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
	and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities
	and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to
	ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company’s reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
	is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure.


	 


	Based upon that evaluation, including our Chief
	Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
	as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.


	 



	Management’s Report on Internal Control
	over Financial Reporting



	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing
	and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934). Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 based
	on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
	Commission (2013 framework). As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of June 30, 2016 our internal control
	over financial reporting was not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control
	over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: (i) inadequate segregation of duties and
	effective risk assessment; and (ii) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect
	to the requirements and application of both US GAAP and SEC guidelines.


	 


	We plan to take steps to enhance and improve
	the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have
	not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we hope to implement the following
	changes during our fiscal year ending June 30, 2016: (i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation
	of duties and ineffective risk management; and (ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial
	reporting. The remediation efforts set out in (i) and (ii) are largely dependent upon our securing additional financing to cover
	the costs of implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation efforts may be adversely
	affected in a material manner.



	 





	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	There was no change in the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the requisite evaluation that occurred during the last
	fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control
	over financial reporting.

	Report of Independent
	Registered Public Accounting Firm


	 


	 


	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders


	Star Century Pandaho Corporation,


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheets
	of Star Century Pandaho Corporation (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations,
	stockholders’ deficiency, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
	Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	 


	We conducted our audits in accordance with
	the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company
	is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included
	consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the
	circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over
	financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
	the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
	by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred
	to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Star Century Pandaho Corporation as of June 30, 2016
	and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the
	Company has a stockholders’ deficiency and has incurred recurring losses from operations and used cash in operating activities
	since inception. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s
	plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The accompanying financial statements
	do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	STAR CENTURY PANDAHO CORPORATION






	Notes to Financial Statements




	For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015



	 


	NOTE 1. NATURE AND BACKGROUND OF BUSINESS


	 


	Star Century Pandaho Corporation ("the
	Company", “SCPD”) was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 21, 2009. The Company was established
	as part of the Chapter 11 reorganization of AP Corporate Services, Inc. ("AP").


	 


	In January, 2015, Star Century Entertainment,
	Inc acquired 53.66% of total outstanding shares of the Company. In conjunction with gaining control of the Company, Star Century
	Entertainment elected three individuals to be the Company’s management, amended the Company’s Articles of Incorporation
	to (i) change the name of the Company to Star Century Pandaho Corporation (ii) effect a 1-for-5,000 reverse common stock split
	and (iii) decrease the Company’s authorized common stock to 150,000,000 shares, par value $0.001. On May 20, 2015, the Company’s
	Board of Directors and the majority shareholder amended the Company’s Articles of Incorporation to increase authorized common
	stock to 250,000,000 shares. All common stock share and per-share amounts for all periods presented in these financial statements
	have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the reverse stock split.


	 


	Pandaho the Panda is a cartoon styled character.
	On May 22, 2015, the Company secured certain licensing rights to the Pandaho character and brand though a licensing agreement with
	the creator of Pandaho, Ms. Liu Li. The Company’s aim is to build Pandaho into a competitive cartoon brand with Pandaho-themed
	merchandise and multi-media exhibitions.


	 



	Going concern



	 


	The accompany financial statements on a going
	concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course
	of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, for the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss
	of $1,184,889 and used cash in operating activities of $96,860, and at June 30, 2016, had a working capital deficiency of $1,129,920
	and stockholders’ deficiency of $1,267,221. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue
	as a going concern. The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our June 30, 2016 financial
	statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company’s
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	 


	The Company has experienced recurring operating
	losses and used cash in operating activities since inception. We expect to be able to secure capital through advances from our
	officers or principal shareholders in order to pay expenses such as filing fees, accounting fees and legal fees. Over the next
	12 months, the Company expects to expend approximately $60,000 for such filing fees, accounting fees and legal fees. The Company
	has not yet determined the amount of cash that will be necessary to fund its planned operations in China. We hope to be able to
	attract suitable investors for our business plan. The inability to obtain financing or generate sufficient cash from operations
	could require us to reduce or eliminate expenditures or otherwise curtail or discontinue our operations, which could have a material
	adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, to the extent that we raise additional
	capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities may result in dilution to existing
	stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences
	and privileges senior to holders of our common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. Regardless
	of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate providers of services
	by issuing stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing stockholders.

	NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	 


	ESTIMATES


	 


	The preparation of financial statements in
	conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include, among others, the accrual of potential liabilities, and the
	assumptions used in valuing share-based instruments issued for services.


	 


	CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS


	 


	Investments with original maturities of three
	months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.


	 


	INCOME TAXES


	 


	The Company follows the asset and liability
	method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
	tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis
	(temporary differences). The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income
	(loss) in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	REVENUE


	 


	Revenue is recognized when the price is fixed
	or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service has been delivered, and collectability is reasonably
	assured. In transactions in which the Company brokers a sale and determines that it was not the primary obligor in the arrangement,
	the Company records as net the commission earned from the transaction.


	 


	BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE


	 


	Basic loss per share is computed by dividing
	net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted
	loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
	shares outstanding plus the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all dilutive potential common
	shares had been issued. Diluted loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.


	 


	At June 30, 2016 and 2015, we excluded the outstanding securities
	summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof to acquire shares of common stock as their effect would have been anti-dilutive:

	STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION


	 


	The Company may periodically issue shares of
	common stock, stock options, or warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and for
	financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative
	guidance provided by the FASB whereas the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense
	on the straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting
	to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB whereas the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement
	date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary
	performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Options granted to non-employees are revalued each reporting period to
	determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the options vest, they are valued on each vesting
	date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date
	of vesting. Non-employee stock-based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.
	In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately
	vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date.






	 


	F-

	8



	 







	 






	 


	The fair value of the Company's common stock
	option grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free
	interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the common stock options, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded
	based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions
	used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.


	 


	FAIR VALUE
	OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


	 


	Fair value is defined as the price that would
	be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
	the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated
	based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity.
	In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk including our own credit risk.


	 


	Authoritative guidance provided by the FASB
	defines the following levels directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these
	financial assets:


	 


	Level 1 – inputs are based
	upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.


	Level 2 – inputs are based
	upon significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for identical or similar
	instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable
	in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.


	Level 3 – inputs are generally
	unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the
	asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted
	cash flow models, and similar techniques.


	The estimated fair value of certain financial
	instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis,
	which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The recorded values of the convertible
	notes-related parties and non-redeemable convertible note approximates their fair values based upon their effective interest rates.


	 


	CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK


	 


	Financial instruments, which potentially subject
	the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash with high quality
	financial institutions and at times may exceed the FDIC $250,000 insurance limit. The Company does not anticipate incurring any
	losses related to these credit risks. The Company extends credit based on an evaluation of the customer's financial condition,
	generally without collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customer's financial condition.
	The Company monitors its exposure for credit losses and intends to maintain allowances for anticipated losses, as required.


	 


	During the
	year ended June 30, 2015, 100% of our revenue was from one customer.

	RECENT ACCOUNTING
	PRONOUNCEMENTS


	 


	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers.

	ASU 2014-09 is
	a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under current
	U.S. GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies
	recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. The ASU also will require
	additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts,
	including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract.
	ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted only in
	annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods therein. Entities will be able to transition
	to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is in the process
	of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures.


	 


	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

	Leases.

	ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the balance
	sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for all interim and annual reporting periods beginning
	after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for
	capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in
	the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact
	that the standard could have on its financial statements and related disclosures.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued the ASU 2016-09,

	Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.

	The amendments in this ASU require, among other things, that all
	income tax effects of awards be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. The ASU also allows for
	an employer to repurchase more of an employee's shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability
	accounting and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amendments in this ASU are effective
	for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
	for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could
	have on its financial statements and related disclosures.


	 


	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,

	Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,

	which provides guidance on determining
	when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim
	and annual assessments of an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements
	are issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt about the entity’s
	ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim
	periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the expected impact that the standard could
	have on its financial statements and related disclosures.


	 


	Other recent accounting pronouncements issued
	by the FASB, including its Emerging Issues Task Force, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities
	and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future
	consolidated financial statements.


	 


	NOTE 3. COMPENSATION AND ACCRUED COMPENSATION-RELATED
	PARTY


	 


	Compensation-related party and accrued compensation-related
	party represent amounts recorded for employment contracts with three executives and a consulting agreement with a shareholder.
	Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, total annual compensation for services is $396,000 (“cash compensation”),
	and the executives and shareholder have the option to accept shares of the Company’s common stock in lieu of cash based on
	a 50% discount to the average stock price, as defined. The option to accept shares of common stock in lieu of cash is accounted
	for at the intrinsic value of the potentially issuable common shares and is subject to adjustment at each reporting date based
	on the change in market value of the shares. At June 30, 2015, the balance of accrued compensation was $287,693. During the year
	ended June 30, 2016, one individual elected to be paid in shares for $120,000 of accrued compensation due him. The
	total fair value of shares issued to the individual was $273,993, and the difference of $153,993 was recognized as stock compensation
	expense. During the year ended June 30, 2016, cash compensation of $396,000 was accrued and at June 30, 2016, accrued cash compensation
	totaled $563,693. At June 30, 2016, if the executives and shareholder elected to be paid in shares of common stock, it would result
	in the issuance of 14,453,671 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $867,220. Accordingly, at June 30,
	2016, the Company has recorded accrued compensation of $867,220. For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded
	$751,830 and $287,693 of compensation expense, respectively, related to these agreements, which included $396,000 and $287,693,
	respectively, for the accrual of annual cash compensation, with the balance reflecting an expense for the value that could be paid
	in shares of common stock.

	Principal payments due on convertible notes-related party are as
	follows: Fiscal year ending June 30, 2017: $58,581, and fiscal year ending June 30, 2018: $108,000.


	 


	During the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company
	issued twelve convertible notes for total proceeds of $144,381. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the notes include accrued interest payable
	of $12,000 and $0, respectively. The notes are unsecured, accrue interest at 10% per annum, are due through December, 2017, and
	are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.10 per share. In addition, at June
	30, 2016, $10,200 of advances due to a shareholder is included in convertible notes-related party. The advances are convertible
	into the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.10 per share, are unsecured, noninterest bearing, and due June
	30, 2017.


	 


	The closing price of the Company’s common
	stock ranged from $0.08 per share to $0.81 per share on the dates the notes were issued. The Company determined that certain of
	the notes contained a beneficial conversion feature of $133,493 since the market price of the Company’s common stock was
	greater than the conversion price for eleven notes when issued. The Company recorded the beneficial conversion feature as a discount
	(up to the face amount of the applicable note) to be amortized over the life of the related note. During the year ended June 30,
	2016, $98,551 of discount amortization is included in interest expense at June 30, 2016, there was an unamortized discount balance
	of $34,942 to be amortized through June 2017.


	 


	NOTE 6. NON-REDEEMABLE CONVERTIBLE NOTE

	On February 20, 2014, the Company agreed to
	exchange advances due an unrelated party, the original note holder, for a note for $68,000. The note bears interest at 20% per
	annum, and is secured by all the assets of the Company. The note was originally due August 1, 2014 and has been was extended to
	August 1, 2016. The Company may prepay the note in readily available funds at any time prior to the maturity date. The Company
	has the right to convert the note into shares of the Company’s common stock at any time prior to the maturity date at a fixed
	price of $0.05 per share of common stock. In January 2015, $25,000 of the $68,000 principal and accrued interest was assigned to
	a related party of the Company by the original note holder. On July 31, 2015, the Company repaid $61,892 of principal and interest
	due to the original note holder. At June 30, 2016, the face amount of the note, due to a related party, plus accrued interest was
	$42,551 and is convertible into 851,020 shares of common stock. As it is the Company’s choice to convert the note into shares
	of the Company’s common stock or to pay the note in cash, the note is presented below current liabilities on the accompanying
	balance sheets.


	 


	NOTE 7. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY


	 



	Designation and issuance of Series B Preferred
	stock




	 



	On September 4, 2015, the Company filed a Certificate
	of Designation designating the rights and restrictions of 100,000 shares of Series B Preferred stock, par value $0.01 pursuant
	to resolutions approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on June 11, 2015.


	 


	The holders of Series B Preferred stock are
	entitled to vote together with the holders of common stock, as a single class, upon all matters submitted to holders of common
	stock for a vote. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock has the voting power of 5,000 shares of common stock. The Series B Preferred
	stock is not convertible into common stock. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, Series B
	Preferred stock shall have a liquidation preference to the common stock in the amount of par value per share.


	 


	On September 8, 2015, the Company issued 25,000
	shares of Series B Preferred Stock in exchange for $44,787 due to Star Century Entertainment Corporation, a related party. The
	fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock as determined by a third party valuation expert was determined to be $109,787. The difference
	between the fair value of Series B Preferred Stock of $109,787 and the $44,787 debt settled of $65,000 is recorded as a loss on
	settlement of debt in the accompany statement of operations. At June 30, 2016, there were 68,708,924 shares of common stock outstanding.
	Based on the voting rights of the Series B Preferred stock of 125,000,000 shares of common stock, Star Century Entertainment has
	the ability to elect our directors and determine the outcome of votes by our stockholders on corporate matters, including mergers,
	sales of our assets, charter amendments and other matters requiring stockholder approval.

	and other related names and intangibles. Immediately after the transaction Lui Li held 61.5% of the outstanding common stock of
	the Company. Based on Li’s 61.5% ownership percentage, Li in substance controlled the Pandaho intellectual property directly
	after the purchase of the Pandaho IP by the Company. Given this, the value of the intellectual property recorded at the date of
	acquisition was carried over at the historical cost to Li of zero.


	On May 22, 2015, the Board authorized
	the issuance of 20,000,000 shares of common stock to Asia International Finance Holdings, Hong Kong for an unsecured, non-interest

	NOTE 8. INCOME TAXES


	 


	For the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
	our net losses were $1,184,889 and $4,748,797, respectively, and no provision for income taxes was recorded. We made no provision
	for income taxes due to our utilization of federal net operating loss carry forwards to offset both regular taxable income and
	alternative minimum taxable income.


	 


	Income taxes differ from the amount that would
	be computed by applying the Federal statutory income tax rates of 34% as follows:

	The Company has provided a valuation allowance
	on the deferred tax assets at June 30, 2016 and 2015 to reduce such asset to zero, since there is no assurance that the Company
	will generate future taxable income to utilize such asset. Management will review this valuation allowance requirement periodically
	and make adjustments as warranted. The net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended June 30, 2015 was an increase of
	$276,275.


	 


	The Company has net operating loss carryforwards
	of approximately $1.4 million for federal purposes available to offset future taxable income that expire in varying amounts through
	2034. The ability to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards could be limited by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code
	which limits their use if there is a change in control (generally a greater than 50% change in ownership). The Company is subject
	to examination by tax authorities for all years for which a loss carry forward is utilized in subsequent periods.

	The Company follows FASB guidelines that address
	the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial
	statements. Under this guidance, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than
	not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.
	The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that
	has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This guidance also provides guidance on
	derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures.
	As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and no adjustment was required
	at adoption. The tax years 2011 through 2016 remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions in which the Company
	operate


	 


	The Company’s policy is to record interest
	and penalties on uncertain tax provisions as income tax expense. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has no accrued interest
	or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.
