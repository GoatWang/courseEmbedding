Publisher's Description▼▲
Winner of the 2013 Christianity Today Book Award for Theology/EthicsScholars and laypersons alike regard Jonathan Edwards (1703-58) as North America's greatest theologian.  The Theology of Jonathan Edwards is the most comprehensive survey of his theology yet produced and the first study to make full use of the recently-completed seventy-three-volume online edition of the Works of Jonathan Edwards. The book's forty-five chapters examine all major aspects of Edwards's thought and include in-depth discussions of the extensive secondary literature on Edwards as well as Edwards's own writings. Its opening chapters set out Edwards's historical and personal theological contexts. The next thirty chapters connect Edwards's theological loci in the temporally-ordered way in which he conceptualized the theological enterprise-beginning with the triune God in eternity with his angels to the history of redemption as an expression of God's inner reality ad extra, and then back to God in eschatological glory. The authors analyze such themes as aesthetics, metaphysics, typology, history of redemption, revival, and true virtue. They also take up such rarely-explored topics as Edwards's missiology, treatment of heaven and angels, sacramental thought, public theology, and views of non-Christian religions. Running throughout the volume are what the authors identify as five basic theological constituents: trinitarian communication, creaturely participation, necessitarian dispositionalism, divine priority, and harmonious constitutionalism. Later chapters trace his influence on and connections with later theologies and philosophies in America and Europe. The result is a multi-layered analysis that treats Edwards as a theologian for the twenty-first-century global Christian community, and a bridge between the Christian West and East, Protestantism and Catholicism, conservatism and liberalism, and charismatic and non-charismatic churches.

Editorial Reviews▼▲
"The Theology of Jonathan Edwards is the most comprehensive treatment of Edwards's theology currently available in one volume ... a significant contribution to Edwardsean studies." --The Master's Seminary Journal"This massive tome succeeds in fulfilling the authors' intention to provide an introduction to Edwards's theology...It is difficult to imagine another introduction surpassing this one in the breadth of its exploration of Edwards, his interpreters, and his influence. All who wish to explore Edwards's theology must now begin here."--Religious Studies Review"An invitation to sample the profundity and versatility of America's greatest theologian--the sources from which he drew, the theologians from whom he diverged, and the creative theological solutions he proposed. There is never a 'last word,' of course, but at certain points in time indispensable resources appear. The Theology of Jonathan Edwards is one of them." --Church History"A truly impressive work. It is remarkable to find a comprehensive and insightful guide to all of Edwards's theology in one place and in a volume that is a pleasure to read." --George Marsden, author of Jonathan Edwards: A Life "Comprehensive, learned, and accessible--unquestionably the best starting place for anyone wanting to grapple with the ideas of America's greatest theologian." --Alister E. McGrath, Professor of Theology, Ministry, and Education, King's College, London "Scholarship on Jonathan Edwards has in recent years risen to a great flood. Yet despite heightened interest, there have been very few efforts to treat Edwards' formidable theology as a whole. With this book Michael McClymond and Gerald McDermott meet that pressing need and meet it very well. The book is clear, comprehensive, balanced, nuanced, and authoritative--in a word, a splendid volume about one of the truly great thinkers in all of American history." --Mark Noll, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History, University of Notre Dame "Jonathan Edwards is not just an American theologian but a man who has profoundly influenced thinking about doctrinal questions and revival practice all over the world. This volume offers a series of forty-five short chapters that together provide a comprehensive account of his convictions and legacy down to contemporary appreciation of his thought. Edwards emerges as one of the most creative theologians the universal church has ever produced." --David Bebbington, Professor of History, University of Stirling "With interest in Jonathan Edwards at an unprecedented high around the world, The Theology of Jonathan Edwards is a truly useful and unmatched digest of his times, thought, and influence. Edwards is one of the most-written about religious figures of the eighteenth-century, and with such a mountain of literature to navigate, this volume provides the single best entry point into Edwards' writings and ideas for the specialist and general reader alike." --Kenneth P. Minkema, Executive Editor and Director of the Works of Jonathan Edwards, Yale University"Draws on the recently completed 73-volume edition of the writings of the American theologian (1703-58)."--The Chronicle Review"Informative and illuminating...this volume is absolutely necessary for any future scholarly work on Edwards...Essential."--CHOICE "An engaging analysis of Edwards' thought filled with valuable historical observations and careful explanation of Edwards' theology. It would be hard to imagine a better introduction written for both specialist and non-specialist interested in Edwards' spirituality and profound insights on Scripture than McCylmond and McDermott's outstanding contribution."--The Banner of Truth"This is indeed a definitive and comprehensive compendium of Edwards's theology...The excellent tandem of McClymond and McDermott has produced a standard and indispensable reading...I finish writing writing this review with the sweet and happy music still ringing in my ears."--Evangelical Studies Bulletin"McDermott and McClymond have done a great service for scholars and laypeople interested in Edwards by writing forty-five chapters in which they have provided syntheses of various aspects to Edwards's life, thought, and legacy." --Exploring the Study of Religious History

History[edit]
Edwards Lifesciences’ roots date to 1958, when Miles “Lowell” Edwards set out to build the first artificial heart.
Edwards was a 60-year-old, recently retired engineer holding 63 patents in an array of industries, with an entrepreneurial spirit and a dream of helping patients with heart disease. His fascination with healing the heart was sparked in his teens, when he suffered two bouts of a disease called rheumatic fever, which can scar heart valves and eventually cause the heart to fail.
With a background in hydraulics and fuel pump operations, Edwards believed the human heart could be mechanized. He presented the idea to Dr. Albert Starr, a young surgeon at the University of Oregon Medical School, who thought the idea was too complex. Instead, Starr encouraged Edwards to focus first on developing an artificial heart valve, for which there was an immediate need.
After just two years, the first Starr-Edwards mitral valve was designed, developed, tested, and successfully placed in a patient. Newspapers around the world reported on what they termed a “miraculous” heart surgery.
This innovation spawned a company, Edwards Laboratories, which set up shop in Santa Ana, California – not far from where Edwards Lifesciences’ corporate headquarters is located today.
In 1966, Edwards Laboratories was purchased by American Hospital Supply Corporation and became American Edwards Laboratories. Then, in 1985, American Edwards was acquired by Baxter International Inc. In early 2000, the company was spun off as an independent, publicly held corporation and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “EW.”[3]
Activity[edit]
Today, Edwards continues as a leader in the field of tissue replacement heart valves and repair products and advanced hemodynamic monitoring, which have helped treat and manage more than 2 million patients worldwide. Each year, more than 300,000 valve replacements are performed worldwide through open-heart surgery, utilizing either bioprosthetic tissue valves or mechanical valves. Edwards products include tissue replacement heart valves, sold under such brand names as Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT and Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT MAGNA, and also valve repair products that are used by surgeons to fix, instead of replace, a patient’s valve.[4]
The Edwards SAPIEN family of heart valves are delivered via a procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This procedure enables the placement of a collapsible heart valve into the body via a tube-based delivery system (catheter) that can be inserted through multiple access routes, including either an incision in the leg (transfemoral), or in between the ribs and to be threaded up to the heart (transapical), or through the front of the chest and then through a small hole in the aorta (transaortic). The valve is designed to replace a patient’s diseased native aortic valve without traditional open-heart surgery and while the heart continues to beat – avoiding the need to stop the patient’s heart and connect them to a heart-lung machine that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and the patient’s breathing during surgery (cardiopulmonary bypass).
Edwards also manufactures products for vascular therapy along with hemodynamic monitoring devices for measuring cardiovascular performance during surgery and in the ICU. Hemodynamic monitoring is the measurement of blood circulation and cardiac function that allows clinicians to evaluate whether enough oxygen is being delivered to the organs and tissues. Among these is the Swan-Ganz catheter. Originally developed for patients with acute myocardial infarction, it is now used in anesthesia and critical care units. Healthcare providers use this monitoring to detect changes or problems in a patient’s health, which allows for more informed, immediate treatment decisions.
To facilitate on-pump cardiac surgery procedures through smaller incisions, Edwards also offers a cardiac surgery product line comprising soft tissue retractors, venous and arterial cannulae, aortic occlusion, venting, and coronary sinus catheters, as well as reusable instruments for performing minimally invasive valvular procedures.[5]

History[edit]
Edwards Lifesciences’ roots date to 1958, when Miles “Lowell” Edwards set out to build the first artificial heart.
Edwards was a 60-year-old, recently retired engineer holding 63 patents in an array of industries, with an entrepreneurial spirit and a dream of helping patients with heart disease. His fascination with healing the heart was sparked in his teens, when he suffered two bouts of a disease called rheumatic fever, which can scar heart valves and eventually cause the heart to fail.
With a background in hydraulics and fuel pump operations, Edwards believed the human heart could be mechanized. He presented the idea to Dr. Albert Starr, a young surgeon at the University of Oregon Medical School, who thought the idea was too complex. Instead, Starr encouraged Edwards to focus first on developing an artificial heart valve, for which there was an immediate need.
After just two years, the first Starr-Edwards mitral valve was designed, developed, tested, and successfully placed in a patient. Newspapers around the world reported on what they termed a “miraculous” heart surgery.
