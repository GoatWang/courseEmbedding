Early life and career[edit]
Education[edit]
Dragas attended the University of Virginia and graduated with a B.A. in economics and foreign affairs in 1984. She also graduated from the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration in 1988.[1][2] By the early 1990s Dragas had become the President of the Tidewater Mortgage Bankers Association.[3]
The Dragas Companies[edit]
The Dragas Companies is a southeastern Virginia real estate development and building company founded by Dragas' father and uncle, George and Mark Dragas, in 1968. Helen Dragas’ first job, as a teenager, was interviewing customers at her family's company about their purchases.[4] Helen Dragas was named president and CEO of the Dragas Companies in 1996 and has remained in that position since. Under her tenure, the company has received numerous local awards, and three national awards: the Lee Evans Award for Building Management Excellence in 1999, and the 2009 Lee Evans Award for Management Excellence in 2009, and the Best Builders Award from Builder Magazine, also in 2009.[5] It is now the region's largest homebuilder,[6] with a focus of improving upon the quality of low-price homes in the area.[7]
In 2007 the Dragas Companies donated $1.5 million to the cities of Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Chesapeake for their use in dealing with homelessness and improving education for children in poverty.[8] In 2009 the Dragas Companies spent over $5 million to voluntarily remediate Chinese drywall that was installed by a subcontractor in over 70 homes without Dragas' knowledge.[9] Helen Dragas was named Virginia Beach's 2009 First Citizen.[10] She was also featured by The Virginian-Pilot in a 2010 article about successful female homebuilders and their achievements in the workplace.[11]
In 2014, Dragas earned a top-15 spot in the Inside Business–Hampton Roads Business Journal’s Power List of people who shape and influence the region of over 1.6 million people. The editor noted Dragas’ tenacity and called for her to apply her leadership in helping the community combat challenges of economic growth, education, and workforce development.[12]
Other positions[edit]
Dragas has served on the Virginia State Transportation Board, which makes decisions on state spending and transportation strategy.[13] Dragas has also served as a director of the utility corporation Dominion Resources since 2010, and has served on their audit committee.[14] She was appointed to the Virginia State Council of Higher Education and the Commonwealth Transportation board by former governor Mark Warner.[15]
UVA Board of Visitors[edit]
First term[edit]
Dragas was appointed as a member of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors by then Governor Tim Kaine in 2008.[16] She became rector of the board on July 1, 2011,[1] and was the first woman ever to be elected to the post.[17]
It’s been noted that Dragas’ state service was uncontroversial[18] until she made headlines in June 2012 as part of the resignation of UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan. Sullivan announced her resignation as president in early June after only two years in the position, citing "philosophical differences" with the Board of Visitors as her reasoning. Media outlets had reported that the rift between Sullivan and the board may have been, in part, due to Dragas' viewpoint that the university was facing serious financial challenges, and that the administration would need to explore fiscally conservative solutions, something Sullivan was not actively pursuing.[19]
A Washington Post story and a UVA student newspaper story had both claimed that Dragas organized the support necessary to oust Sullivan as president.[20] After the resignation, Dragas assured the community that the board was unified in its actions,[21] but some board members later claimed that they had no knowledge of the Sullivan decision until just before her resignation.[22] A former board member, Randal Kirk, publicly stated that he and others believed that Sullivan was the wrong pick from the start.[4] Public records later revealed that a super-majority of the board supported the change in leadership based on personnel reasons.[23] Dragas became the center of attention for those who supported Sullivan in their expression of dismay. According to a public records release, there were over 450 e-mails sent calling for Dragas to resign as rector.[24] Additionally, the faculty senate of UVA passed a resolution supporting Sullivan and expressing a lack of confidence in Dragas.[25] A newspaper report would later reveal that Sullivan’s supporters, mobilized by John O. “Dubby” Wynne, a former UVA rector who had originally hired Sullivan, had established “a ‘war room’ on grounds, where they organized a counterattack, focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members.”[26]
Following the vote, Dragas offered to meet with the faculty senate to discuss the matter, and a meeting took place on June 18, 2012. According to a statement by the faculty senate, the meeting was "cordial," but the faculty senate still demanded both the reinstatement of Sullivan and the resignation of Dragas.[27] As the situation escalated, Governor Bob McDonnell made a statement that if the Board of Visitors did not resolve the issue by their June 26 meeting, he would use his power of appointment to replace all of the board members.[28] At the June 26th meeting, the board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president.[29][30] While e-mails show that Dragas had considered resigning from her position as rector during the height of the situation,[31] she was subsequently reappointed to another term on the board by Governor McDonnell,[32] and has released a joint statement with Sullivan to demonstrate a shared commitment to moving on to solving the university's problems.[33]
Reconfirmation[edit]
Dragas was reconfirmed in January 2013. A March 2, 2013 Washington Post article reported that days after Virginia lawmakers confirmed Dragas’s reappointment to the board in January, the rector sent the president a lengthy and detailed list of goals to meet this school year. Sullivan claimed that the letter was inappropriate and constituted micromanagement.[34] The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) issued a report on March 14, 2013 criticizing the actions of the Board in general and Dragas in particular. The report stated that Dragas was not prepared for the disruptive influence of online education, that she had previously made uninformed statements, and that she seemed inexperienced in her position.[35][36][37] [32] It was noted that the report contained “multiple errors of fact.”[38] The American Council of Trustees and Alumni later praised the work of Dragas and the Board, stating that “If students are to receive a quality and affordable education in Virginia, it is the trustees who are going to have to press for, measure, and demand results."[39] Dragas’ financial support of the university has been documented, noting that she has donated nearly half a million dollars to the university, “but she considers herself a voice for the state's lower- and middle-income families,” added one news report.[40] In April 2013 Dragas was on the losing end of a 14-2 vote to raise tuition, claiming that the rise in tuition was putting the school on an unsustainable track. Dragas argued that tuition was rising faster than the income of Virginia families, so could become a barrier to post-secondary education.[41][42]
End of tenure[edit]
The Washington Post wrote that the ouster of Sullivan served to be beneficial for the university in terms of developing an attitude in favor of long term change.[43] In an exit interview from the position, Dragas stated that, "I believe we did the right thing in that we pushed for needed change ... We did it the wrong way in that we misunderstood that when you're going to try to solve thorne-y problems at a high-profile, public institution, you need to communicate a lot -- a lot more than we did -- and with a lot of people. And that was a lesson that I, in particular, and the board learned the hard way."[44] Her term as Rector ended at the end of June 2013,[45] though she remains a member of the board.[46]
In August 2013, Dragas was one of only two members of the Board of Visitors to vote against scaling back the university’s financial aid program, Access U.Va., which assured low-income students could graduate without debt.[47] The U.Va. Student Council submitted a letter echoing Dragas, requesting the program be maintained as it has operated for nine years.[48] Following the decision, Ms. Dragas maintained her opposition to the measure stating that, “[t]his action raises the cost of a UVa degree substantially for students from low-income families, hurting our diversity and coming at a time when we are already seen as elitist and unwelcoming.”[49] Some alumni and students have begun organizing support and sending emails to administrators in an effort to reverse the decision.
In September 2013, Dragas was noted for further expressing her opposition to tuition increases in the aftermath of a meeting between foundation representatives, administrators, deans and some board members who are advocates for raising in-state student tuition.[50] Later in the Fall at a November meeting, Dragas urged her fellow board members to delay approving elements of a new strategic plan, reiterating a need for more discussion on the plan’s potential impacts to tuition and financial aid.[51] Dragas specifically raised a concern about several years of double-digit tuition increases,[51] following comments for the university’s president that the possibility of tuition increases have not been ruled out to pay for parts of the strategic plan, especially improvements to curriculum and student engagement.[52]
Ms. Dragas was featured in Hampton Road Magazine’s list of “10 Leading Ladies” featuring the advice of powerful and inspiring women. She further mentioned the importance of affordable tuition by attributing her success and inspiration to the fact that she and her family “were able to afford the cost of a life-changing undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Virginia."[53]
Advocacy on Affordability[edit]
Throughout 2014, Dragas was further recognized for her advocacy of affordable higher education.[12] Dragas has been joined by other members of the Board in raising concerns that the university has relied too much on yearly tuition increases to backfill stagnant state funding, lack of strategic planning, and declining research.[54]
Dragas and fellow board members have also pointed to the university’s lack of a long-term financial plan as one reason for the continued escalation of tuition.[55] In response, in June 2014, the UVa Board of Visitors set up a special subcommittee to work on a long-range plan targeting affordability for students.[55]
During a June meeting of the UVa Board of Visitors, Dragas again raised the issue of the University’s public mission to provide affordable access to Virginians, arguing that board members owe their primary duty of loyalty to the public and then to the University.[56] A newspaper article on the meeting pointed to tuition increases, as an example, which may limit access to Virginians with lower incomes but help the university administration avoid difficult budget decisions.[56] One Virginia newspaper, the Daily Progress, cheered “Hooray for Helen Dragas”, and editorialized that Dragas was “spot-on in saying that the University of Virginia, including its governing board, should put the public interest first.”[57] Calling her “right on the money on these issues”, the Progress also agreed with Dragas that a proposed code of conduct muzzling Board member expression of dissenting views would be an unrighteous decision for a public institution.[57]
Personal life[edit]
Dragas lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She is married to Lewis Webb, an attorney; they have three children.[58]

She also graduated from the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration in 1988.[1][2] By the early 1990s Dragas had become the President of the Tidewater Mortgage Bankers Association.[3]

The Dragas Companies is a southeastern Virginia real estate development and building company founded by Dragas' father and uncle, George and Mark Dragas, in 1968.

Dragas was appointed as a member of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors by then Governor Tim Kaine in 2008.[16] She became rector of the board on July 1, 2011,[1] and was the first woman ever to be elected to the post.[17]

In September 2013, Dragas was noted for further expressing her opposition to tuition increases in the aftermath of a meeting between foundation representatives, administrators, deans and some board members who are advocates for raising in-state student tuition.[50] Later in the Fall at a November meeting, Dragas urged her fellow board members to delay approving elements of a new strategic plan, reiterating a need for more discussion on the plan’s potential impacts to tuition and financial aid.[51] Dragas specifically raised a concern about several years of double-digit tuition increases,[51] following comments for the university’s president that the possibility of tuition increases have not been ruled out to pay for parts of the strategic plan, especially improvements to curriculum and student engagement.[52]
Ms. Dragas was featured in Hampton Road Magazine’s list of “10 Leading Ladies” featuring the advice of powerful and inspiring women. She further mentioned the importance of affordable tuition by attributing her success and inspiration to the fact that she and her family “were able to afford the cost of a life-changing undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Virginia."[53]
Advocacy on Affordability[edit]
Throughout 2014, Dragas was further recognized for her advocacy of affordable higher education.[12] Dragas has been joined by other members of the Board in raising concerns that the university has relied too much on yearly tuition increases to backfill stagnant state funding, lack of strategic planning, and declining research.[54]
Dragas and fellow board members have also pointed to the university’s lack of a long-term financial plan as one reason for the continued escalation of tuition.[55] In response, in June 2014, the UVa Board of Visitors set up a special subcommittee to work on a long-range plan targeting affordability for students.[55]
During a June meeting of the UVa Board of Visitors, Dragas again raised the issue of the University’s public mission to provide affordable access to Virginians, arguing that board members owe their primary duty of loyalty to the public and then to the University.[56] A newspaper article on the meeting pointed to tuition increases, as an example, which may limit access to Virginians with lower incomes but help the university administration avoid difficult budget decisions.[56] One Virginia newspaper, the Daily Progress, cheered “Hooray for Helen Dragas”, and editorialized that Dragas was “spot-on in saying that the University of Virginia, including its governing board, should put the public interest first.”[57] Calling her “right on the money on these issues”, the Progress also agreed with Dragas that a proposed code of conduct muzzling Board member expression of dissenting views would be an unrighteous decision for a public institution.[57]
Personal life[edit]
Dragas lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She is married to Lewis Webb, an attorney; they have three children.[58]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Early life and career[edit]
Education[edit]
Dragas attended the University of Virginia and graduated with a B.A. in economics and foreign affairs in 1984. She also graduated from the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration in 1988.[1][2] By the early 1990s Dragas had become the President of the Tidewater Mortgage Bankers Association.[3]
The Dragas Companies[edit]
The Dragas Companies is a southeastern Virginia real estate development and building company founded by Dragas' father and uncle, George and Mark Dragas, in 1968. Helen Dragas’ first job, as a teenager, was interviewing customers at her family's company about their purchases.[4] Helen Dragas was named president and CEO of the Dragas Companies in 1996 and has remained in that position since. Under her tenure, the company has received numerous local awards, and three national awards: the Lee Evans Award for Building Management Excellence in 1999, and the 2009 Lee Evans Award for Management Excellence in 2009, and the Best Builders Award from Builder Magazine, also in 2009.[5] It is now the region's largest homebuilder,[6] with a focus of improving upon the quality of low-price homes in the area.[7]
In 2007 the Dragas Companies donated $1.5 million to the cities of Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Chesapeake for their use in dealing with homelessness and improving education for children in poverty.[8] In 2009 the Dragas Companies spent over $5 million to voluntarily remediate Chinese drywall that was installed by a subcontractor in over 70 homes without Dragas' knowledge.[9] Helen Dragas was named Virginia Beach's 2009 First Citizen.[10] She was also featured by The Virginian-Pilot in a 2010 article about successful female homebuilders and their achievements in the workplace.[11]
In 2014, Dragas earned a top-15 spot in the Inside Business–Hampton Roads Business Journal’s Power List of people who shape and influence the region of over 1.6 million people. The editor noted Dragas’ tenacity and called for her to apply her leadership in helping the community combat challenges of economic growth, education, and workforce development.[12]
Other positions[edit]
Dragas has served on the Virginia State Transportation Board, which makes decisions on state spending and transportation strategy.[13] Dragas has also served as a director of the utility corporation Dominion Resources since 2010, and has served on their audit committee.[14] She was appointed to the Virginia State Council of Higher Education and the Commonwealth Transportation board by former governor Mark Warner.[15]
UVA Board of Visitors[edit]
First term[edit]
Dragas was appointed as a member of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors by then Governor Tim Kaine in 2008.[16] She became rector of the board on July 1, 2011,[1] and was the first woman ever to be elected to the post.[17]
It’s been noted that Dragas’ state service was uncontroversial[18] until she made headlines in June 2012 as part of the resignation of UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan. Sullivan announced her resignation as president in early June after only two years in the position, citing "philosophical differences" with the Board of Visitors as her reasoning. Media outlets had reported that the rift between Sullivan and the board may have been, in part, due to Dragas' viewpoint that the university was facing serious financial challenges, and that the administration would need to explore fiscally conservative solutions, something Sullivan was not actively pursuing.[19]
A Washington Post story and a UVA student newspaper story had both claimed that Dragas organized the support necessary to oust Sullivan as president.[20] After the resignation, Dragas assured the community that the board was unified in its actions,[21] but some board members later claimed that they had no knowledge of the Sullivan decision until just before her resignation.[22] A former board member, Randal Kirk, publicly stated that he and others believed that Sullivan was the wrong pick from the start.[4] Public records later revealed that a super-majority of the board supported the change in leadership based on personnel reasons.[23] Dragas became the center of attention for those who supported Sullivan in their expression of dismay. According to a public records release, there were over 450 e-mails sent calling for Dragas to resign as rector.[24] Additionally, the faculty senate of UVA passed a resolution supporting Sullivan and expressing a lack of confidence in Dragas.[25] A newspaper report would later reveal that Sullivan’s supporters, mobilized by John O. “Dubby” Wynne, a former UVA rector who had originally hired Sullivan, had established “a ‘war room’ on grounds, where they organized a counterattack, focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members.”[26]
Following the vote, Dragas offered to meet with the faculty senate to discuss the matter, and a meeting took place on June 18, 2012. According to a statement by the faculty senate, the meeting was "cordial," but the faculty senate still demanded both the reinstatement of Sullivan and the resignation of Dragas.[27] As the situation escalated, Governor Bob McDonnell made a statement that if the Board of Visitors did not resolve the issue by their June 26 meeting, he would use his power of appointment to replace all of the board members.[28] At the June 26th meeting, the board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president.[29][30] While e-mails show that Dragas had considered resigning from her position as rector during the height of the situation,[31] she was subsequently reappointed to another term on the board by Governor McDonnell,[32] and has released a joint statement with Sullivan to demonstrate a shared commitment to moving on to solving the university's problems.[33]
Reconfirmation[edit]
Dragas was reconfirmed in January 2013. A March 2, 2013 Washington Post article reported that days after Virginia lawmakers confirmed Dragas’s reappointment to the board in January, the rector sent the president a lengthy and detailed list of goals to meet this school year. Sullivan claimed that the letter was inappropriate and constituted micromanagement.[34] The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) issued a report on March 14, 2013 criticizing the actions of the Board in general and Dragas in particular. The report stated that Dragas was not prepared for the disruptive influence of online education, that she had previously made uninformed statements, and that she seemed inexperienced in her position.[35][36][37] [32] It was noted that the report contained “multiple errors of fact.”[38] The American Council of Trustees and Alumni later praised the work of Dragas and the Board, stating that “If students are to receive a quality and affordable education in Virginia, it is the trustees who are going to have to press for, measure, and demand results."[39] Dragas’ financial support of the university has been documented, noting that she has donated nearly half a million dollars to the university, “but she considers herself a voice for the state's lower- and middle-income families,” added one news report.[40] In April 2013 Dragas was on the losing end of a 14-2 vote to raise tuition, claiming that the rise in tuition was putting the school on an unsustainable track. Dragas argued that tuition was rising faster than the income of Virginia families, so could become a barrier to post-secondary education.[41][42]
End of tenure[edit]
The Washington Post wrote that the ouster of Sullivan served to be beneficial for the university in terms of developing an attitude in favor of long term change.[43] In an exit interview from the position, Dragas stated that, "I believe we did the right thing in that we pushed for needed change ... We did it the wrong way in that we misunderstood that when you're going to try to solve thorne-y problems at a high-profile, public institution, you need to communicate a lot -- a lot more than we did -- and with a lot of people. And that was a lesson that I, in particular, and the board learned the hard way."[44] Her term as Rector ended at the end of June 2013,[45] though she remains a member of the board.[46]
In August 2013, Dragas was one of only two members of the Board of Visitors to vote against scaling back the university’s financial aid program, Access U.Va., which assured low-income students could graduate without debt.[47] The U.Va. Student Council submitted a letter echoing Dragas, requesting the program be maintained as it has operated for nine years.[48] Following the decision, Ms. Dragas maintained her opposition to the measure stating that, “[t]his action raises the cost of a UVa degree substantially for students from low-income families, hurting our diversity and coming at a time when we are already seen as elitist and unwelcoming.”[49] Some alumni and students have begun organizing support and sending emails to administrators in an effort to reverse the decision.
In September 2013, Dragas was noted for further expressing her opposition to tuition increases in the aftermath of a meeting between foundation representatives, administrators, deans and some board members who are advocates for raising in-state student tuition.[50] Later in the Fall at a November meeting, Dragas urged her fellow board members to delay approving elements of a new strategic plan, reiterating a need for more discussion on the plan’s potential impacts to tuition and financial aid.[51] Dragas specifically raised a concern about several years of double-digit tuition increases,[51] following comments for the university’s president that the possibility of tuition increases have not been ruled out to pay for parts of the strategic plan, especially improvements to curriculum and student engagement.[52]
Ms. Dragas was featured in Hampton Road Magazine’s list of “10 Leading Ladies” featuring the advice of powerful and inspiring women. She further mentioned the importance of affordable tuition by attributing her success and inspiration to the fact that she and her family “were able to afford the cost of a life-changing undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Virginia."[53]
Advocacy on Affordability[edit]
Throughout 2014, Dragas was further recognized for her advocacy of affordable higher education.[12] Dragas has been joined by other members of the Board in raising concerns that the university has relied too much on yearly tuition increases to backfill stagnant state funding, lack of strategic planning, and declining research.[54]
Dragas and fellow board members have also pointed to the university’s lack of a long-term financial plan as one reason for the continued escalation of tuition.[55] In response, in June 2014, the UVa Board of Visitors set up a special subcommittee to work on a long-range plan targeting affordability for students.[55]
During a June meeting of the UVa Board of Visitors, Dragas again raised the issue of the University’s public mission to provide affordable access to Virginians, arguing that board members owe their primary duty of loyalty to the public and then to the University.[56] A newspaper article on the meeting pointed to tuition increases, as an example, which may limit access to Virginians with lower incomes but help the university administration avoid difficult budget decisions.[56] One Virginia newspaper, the Daily Progress, cheered “Hooray for Helen Dragas”, and editorialized that Dragas was “spot-on in saying that the University of Virginia, including its governing board, should put the public interest first.”[57] Calling her “right on the money on these issues”, the Progress also agreed with Dragas that a proposed code of conduct muzzling Board member expression of dissenting views would be an unrighteous decision for a public institution.[57]
Personal life[edit]
Dragas lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She is married to Lewis Webb, an attorney; they have three children.[58]

Early life and career[edit]
Education[edit]
Dragas attended the University of Virginia and graduated with a B.A. in economics and foreign affairs in 1984. She also graduated from the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration in 1988.[1][2] By the early 1990s Dragas had become the President of the Tidewater Mortgage Bankers Association.[3]
The Dragas Companies[edit]
The Dragas Companies is a southeastern Virginia real estate development and building company founded by Dragas' father and uncle, George and Mark Dragas, in 1968. Helen Dragas’ first job, as a teenager, was interviewing customers at her family's company about their purchases.[4] Helen Dragas was named president and CEO of the Dragas Companies in 1996 and has remained in that position since. Under her tenure, the company has received numerous local awards, and three national awards: the Lee Evans Award for Building Management Excellence in 1999, and the 2009 Lee Evans Award for Management Excellence in 2009, and the Best Builders Award from Builder Magazine, also in 2009.[5] It is now the region's largest homebuilder,[6] with a focus of improving upon the quality of low-price homes in the area.[7]
In 2007 the Dragas Companies donated $1.5 million to the cities of Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Chesapeake for their use in dealing with homelessness and improving education for children in poverty.[8] In 2009 the Dragas Companies spent over $5 million to voluntarily remediate Chinese drywall that was installed by a subcontractor in over 70 homes without Dragas' knowledge.[9] Helen Dragas was named Virginia Beach's 2009 First Citizen.[10] She was also featured by The Virginian-Pilot in a 2010 article about successful female homebuilders and their achievements in the workplace.[11]
In 2014, Dragas earned a top-15 spot in the Inside Business–Hampton Roads Business Journal’s Power List of people who shape and influence the region of over 1.6 million people. The editor noted Dragas’ tenacity and called for her to apply her leadership in helping the community combat challenges of economic growth, education, and workforce development.[12]
Other positions[edit]
Dragas has served on the Virginia State Transportation Board, which makes decisions on state spending and transportation strategy.[13] Dragas has also served as a director of the utility corporation Dominion Resources since 2010, and has served on their audit committee.[14] She was appointed to the Virginia State Council of Higher Education and the Commonwealth Transportation board by former governor Mark Warner.[15]
UVA Board of Visitors[edit]
First term[edit]
Dragas was appointed as a member of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors by then Governor Tim Kaine in 2008.[16] She became rector of the board on July 1, 2011,[1] and was the first woman ever to be elected to the post.[17]
It’s been noted that Dragas’ state service was uncontroversial[18] until she made headlines in June 2012 as part of the resignation of UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan. Sullivan announced her resignation as president in early June after only two years in the position, citing "philosophical differences" with the Board of Visitors as her reasoning. Media outlets had reported that the rift between Sullivan and the board may have been, in part, due to Dragas' viewpoint that the university was facing serious financial challenges, and that the administration would need to explore fiscally conservative solutions, something Sullivan was not actively pursuing.[19]
A Washington Post story and a UVA student newspaper story had both claimed that Dragas organized the support necessary to oust Sullivan as president.[20] After the resignation, Dragas assured the community that the board was unified in its actions,[21] but some board members later claimed that they had no knowledge of the Sullivan decision until just before her resignation.[22] A former board member, Randal Kirk, publicly stated that he and others believed that Sullivan was the wrong pick from the start.[4] Public records later revealed that a super-majority of the board supported the change in leadership based on personnel reasons.[23] Dragas became the center of attention for those who supported Sullivan in their expression of dismay. According to a public records release, there were over 450 e-mails sent calling for Dragas to resign as rector.[24] Additionally, the faculty senate of UVA passed a resolution supporting Sullivan and expressing a lack of confidence in Dragas.[25] A newspaper report would later reveal that Sullivan’s supporters, mobilized by John O. “Dubby” Wynne, a former UVA rector who had originally hired Sullivan, had established “a ‘war room’ on grounds, where they organized a counterattack, focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members.”[26]
Following the vote, Dragas offered to meet with the faculty senate to discuss the matter, and a meeting took place on June 18, 2012. According to a statement by the faculty senate, the meeting was "cordial," but the faculty senate still demanded both the reinstatement of Sullivan and the resignation of Dragas.[27] As the situation escalated, Governor Bob McDonnell made a statement that if the Board of Visitors did not resolve the issue by their June 26 meeting, he would use his power of appointment to replace all of the board members.[28] At the June 26th meeting, the board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president.[29][30] While e-mails show that Dragas had considered resigning from her position as rector during the height of the situation,[31] she was subsequently reappointed to another term on the board by Governor McDonnell,[32] and has released a joint statement with Sullivan to demonstrate a shared commitment to moving on to solving the university's problems.[33]
Reconfirmation[edit]
Dragas was reconfirmed in January 2013. A March 2, 2013 Washington Post article reported that days after Virginia lawmakers confirmed Dragas’s reappointment to the board in January, the rector sent the president a lengthy and detailed list of goals to meet this school year. Sullivan claimed that the letter was inappropriate and constituted micromanagement.[34] The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) issued a report on March 14, 2013 criticizing the actions of the Board in general and Dragas in particular. The report stated that Dragas was not prepared for the disruptive influence of online education, that she had previously made uninformed statements, and that she seemed inexperienced in her position.[35][36][37] [32] It was noted that the report contained “multiple errors of fact.”[38] The American Council of Trustees and Alumni later praised the work of Dragas and the Board, stating that “If students are to receive a quality and affordable education in Virginia, it is the trustees who are going to have to press for, measure, and demand results."[39] Dragas’ financial support of the university has been documented, noting that she has donated nearly half a million dollars to the university, “but she considers herself a voice for the state's lower- and middle-income families,” added one news report.[40] In April 2013 Dragas was on the losing end of a 14-2 vote to raise tuition, claiming that the rise in tuition was putting the school on an unsustainable track. Dragas argued that tuition was rising faster than the income of Virginia families, so could become a barrier to post-secondary education.[41][42]
End of tenure[edit]
The Washington Post wrote that the ouster of Sullivan served to be beneficial for the university in terms of developing an attitude in favor of long term change.[43] In an exit interview from the position, Dragas stated that, "I believe we did the right thing in that we pushed for needed change ... We did it the wrong way in that we misunderstood that when you're going to try to solve thorne-y problems at a high-profile, public institution, you need to communicate a lot -- a lot more than we did -- and with a lot of people. And that was a lesson that I, in particular, and the board learned the hard way."[44] Her term as Rector ended at the end of June 2013,[45] though she remains a member of the board.[46]
In August 2013, Dragas was one of only two members of the Board of Visitors to vote against scaling back the university’s financial aid program, Access U.Va., which assured low-income students could graduate without debt.[47] The U.Va. Student Council submitted a letter echoing Dragas, requesting the program be maintained as it has operated for nine years.[48] Following the decision, Ms. Dragas maintained her opposition to the measure stating that, “[t]his action raises the cost of a UVa degree substantially for students from low-income families, hurting our diversity and coming at a time when we are already seen as elitist and unwelcoming.”[49] Some alumni and students have begun organizing support and sending emails to administrators in an effort to reverse the decision.
In September 2013, Dragas was noted for further expressing her opposition to tuition increases in the aftermath of a meeting between foundation representatives, administrators, deans and some board members who are advocates for raising in-state student tuition.[50] Later in the Fall at a November meeting, Dragas urged her fellow board members to delay approving elements of a new strategic plan, reiterating a need for more discussion on the plan’s potential impacts to tuition and financial aid.[51] Dragas specifically raised a concern about several years of double-digit tuition increases,[51] following comments for the university’s president that the possibility of tuition increases have not been ruled out to pay for parts of the strategic plan, especially improvements to curriculum and student engagement.[52]
Ms. Dragas was featured in Hampton Road Magazine’s list of “10 Leading Ladies” featuring the advice of powerful and inspiring women. She further mentioned the importance of affordable tuition by attributing her success and inspiration to the fact that she and her family “were able to afford the cost of a life-changing undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Virginia."[53]
Advocacy on Affordability[edit]
Throughout 2014, Dragas was further recognized for her advocacy of affordable higher education.[12] Dragas has been joined by other members of the Board in raising concerns that the university has relied too much on yearly tuition increases to backfill stagnant state funding, lack of strategic planning, and declining research.[54]
Dragas and fellow board members have also pointed to the university’s lack of a long-term financial plan as one reason for the continued escalation of tuition.[55] In response, in June 2014, the UVa Board of Visitors set up a special subcommittee to work on a long-range plan targeting affordability for students.[55]
During a June meeting of the UVa Board of Visitors, Dragas again raised the issue of the University’s public mission to provide affordable access to Virginians, arguing that board members owe their primary duty of loyalty to the public and then to the University.[56] A newspaper article on the meeting pointed to tuition increases, as an example, which may limit access to Virginians with lower incomes but help the university administration avoid difficult budget decisions.[56] One Virginia newspaper, the Daily Progress, cheered “Hooray for Helen Dragas”, and editorialized that Dragas was “spot-on in saying that the University of Virginia, including its governing board, should put the public interest first.”[57] Calling her “right on the money on these issues”, the Progress also agreed with Dragas that a proposed code of conduct muzzling Board member expression of dissenting views would be an unrighteous decision for a public institution.[57]
Personal life[edit]
Dragas lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She is married to Lewis Webb, an attorney; they have three children.[58]

Media outlets had reported that the rift between Sullivan and the board may have been, in part, due to Dragas' viewpoint that the university was facing serious financial challenges, and that the administration would need to explore fiscally conservative solutions, something Sullivan was not actively pursuing.[19]
A Washington Post story and a UVA student newspaper story had both claimed that Dragas organized the support necessary to oust Sullivan as president.[20] After the resignation, Dragas assured the community that the board was unified in its actions,[21] but some board members later claimed that they had no knowledge of the Sullivan decision until just before her resignation.[22] A former board member, Randal Kirk, publicly stated that he and others believed that Sullivan was the wrong pick from the start.[4] Public records later revealed that a super-majority of the board supported the change in leadership based on personnel reasons.[23] Dragas became the center of attention for those who supported Sullivan in their expression of dismay. According to a public records release, there were over 450 e-mails sent calling for Dragas to resign as rector.[24] Additionally, the faculty senate of UVA passed a resolution supporting Sullivan and expressing a lack of confidence in Dragas.[25] A newspaper report would later reveal that Sullivan’s supporters, mobilized by John O. “Dubby” Wynne, a former UVA rector who had originally hired Sullivan, had established “a ‘war room’ on grounds, where they organized a counterattack, focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members.”[26]
Following the vote, Dragas offered to meet with the faculty senate to discuss the matter, and a meeting took place on June 18, 2012. According to a statement by the faculty senate, the meeting was "cordial," but the faculty senate still demanded both the reinstatement of Sullivan and the resignation of Dragas.[27] As the situation escalated, Governor Bob McDonnell made a statement that if the Board of Visitors did not resolve the issue by their June 26 meeting, he would use his power of appointment to replace all of the board members.[28] At the June 26th meeting, the board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president.[29][30] While e-mails show that Dragas had considered resigning from her position as rector during the height of the situation,[31] she was subsequently reappointed to another term on the board by Governor McDonnell,[32] and has released a joint statement with Sullivan to demonstrate a shared commitment to moving on to solving the university's problems.[33]
Reconfirmation[edit]
Dragas was reconfirmed in January 2013. A March 2, 2013 Washington Post article reported that days after Virginia lawmakers confirmed Dragas’s reappointment to the board in January, the rector sent the president a lengthy and detailed list of goals to meet this school year. Sullivan claimed that the letter was inappropriate and constituted micromanagement.[34] The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) issued a report on March 14, 2013 criticizing the actions of the Board in general and Dragas in particular. The report stated that Dragas was not prepared for the disruptive influence of online education, that she had previously made uninformed statements, and that she seemed inexperienced in her position.[35][36][37] [32] It was noted that the report contained “multiple errors of fact.”[38] The American Council of Trustees and Alumni later praised the work of Dragas and the Board, stating that “If students are to receive a quality and affordable education in Virginia, it is the trustees who are going to have to press for, measure, and demand results."[39] Dragas’ financial support of the university has been documented, noting that she has donated nearly half a million dollars to the university, “but she considers herself a voice for the state's lower- and middle-income families,” added one news report.[40] In April 2013 Dragas was on the losing end of a 14-2 vote to raise tuition, claiming that the rise in tuition was putting the school on an unsustainable track. Dragas argued that tuition was rising faster than the income of Virginia families, so could become a barrier to post-secondary education.[41][42]
End of tenure[edit]
The Washington Post wrote that the ouster of Sullivan served to be beneficial for the university in terms of developing an attitude in favor of long term change.[43] In an exit interview from the position, Dragas stated that, "I believe we did the right thing in that we pushed for needed change ... We did it the wrong way in that we misunderstood that when you're going to try to solve thorne-y problems at a high-profile, public institution, you need to communicate a lot -- a lot more than we did -- and with a lot of people. And that was a lesson that I, in particular, and the board learned the hard way."[44] Her term as Rector ended at the end of June 2013,[45] though she remains a member of the board.[46]
In August 2013, Dragas was one of only two members of the Board of Visitors to vote against scaling back the university’s financial aid program, Access U.Va., which assured low-income students could graduate without debt.[47] The U.Va. Student Council submitted a letter echoing Dragas, requesting the program be maintained as it has operated for nine years.[48] Following the decision, Ms. Dragas maintained her opposition to the measure stating that, “[t]his action raises the cost of a UVa degree substantially for students from low-income families, hurting our diversity and coming at a time when we are already seen as elitist and unwelcoming.”[49] Some alumni and students have begun organizing support and sending emails to administrators in an effort to reverse the decision.
In September 2013, Dragas was noted for further expressing her opposition to tuition increases in the aftermath of a meeting between foundation representatives, administrators, deans and some board members who are advocates for raising in-state student tuition.[50] Later in the Fall at a November meeting, Dragas urged her fellow board members to delay approving elements of a new strategic plan, reiterating a need for more discussion on the plan’s potential impacts to tuition and financial aid.[51] Dragas specifically raised a concern about several years of double-digit tuition increases,[51] following comments for the university’s president that the possibility of tuition increases have not been ruled out to pay for parts of the strategic plan, especially improvements to curriculum and student engagement.[52]
Ms. Dragas was featured in Hampton Road Magazine’s list of “10 Leading Ladies” featuring the advice of powerful and inspiring women. She further mentioned the importance of affordable tuition by attributing her success and inspiration to the fact that she and her family “were able to afford the cost of a life-changing undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Virginia."[53]
Advocacy on Affordability[edit]
Throughout 2014, Dragas was further recognized for her advocacy of affordable higher education.[12] Dragas has been joined by other members of the Board in raising concerns that the university has relied too much on yearly tuition increases to backfill stagnant state funding, lack of strategic planning, and declining research.[54]
Dragas and fellow board members have also pointed to the university’s lack of a long-term financial plan as one reason for the continued escalation of tuition.[55] In response, in June 2014, the UVa Board of Visitors set up a special subcommittee to work on a long-range plan targeting affordability for students.[55]
During a June meeting of the UVa Board of Visitors, Dragas again raised the issue of the University’s public mission to provide affordable access to Virginians, arguing that board members owe their primary duty of loyalty to the public and then to the University.[56] A newspaper article on the meeting pointed to tuition increases, as an example, which may limit access to Virginians with lower incomes but help the university administration avoid difficult budget decisions.[56] One Virginia newspaper, the Daily Progress, cheered “Hooray for Helen Dragas”, and editorialized that Dragas was “spot-on in saying that the University of Virginia, including its governing board, should put the public interest first.”[57] Calling her “right on the money on these issues”, the Progress also agreed with Dragas that a proposed code of conduct muzzling Board member expression of dissenting views would be an unrighteous decision for a public institution.[57]
Personal life[edit]
Dragas lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She is married to Lewis Webb, an attorney; they have three children.[58]

Early life and career[edit]
Education[edit]
Dragas attended the University of Virginia and graduated with a B.A. in economics and foreign affairs in 1984. She also graduated from the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration in 1988.[1][2] By the early 1990s Dragas had become the President of the Tidewater Mortgage Bankers Association.[3]
The Dragas Companies[edit]
The Dragas Companies is a southeastern Virginia real estate development and building company founded by Dragas' father and uncle, George and Mark Dragas, in 1968. Helen Dragas’ first job, as a teenager, was interviewing customers at her family's company about their purchases.[4] Helen Dragas was named president and CEO of the Dragas Companies in 1996 and has remained in that position since. Under her tenure, the company has received numerous local awards, and three national awards: the Lee Evans Award for Building Management Excellence in 1999, and the 2009 Lee Evans Award for Management Excellence in 2009, and the Best Builders Award from Builder Magazine, also in 2009.[5] It is now the region's largest homebuilder,[6] with a focus of improving upon the quality of low-price homes in the area.[7]
In 2007 the Dragas Companies donated $1.5 million to the cities of Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Chesapeake for their use in dealing with homelessness and improving education for children in poverty.[8] In 2009 the Dragas Companies spent over $5 million to voluntarily remediate Chinese drywall that was installed by a subcontractor in over 70 homes without Dragas' knowledge.[9] Helen Dragas was named Virginia Beach's 2009 First Citizen.[10] She was also featured by The Virginian-Pilot in a 2010 article about successful female homebuilders and their achievements in the workplace.[11]
In 2014, Dragas earned a top-15 spot in the Inside Business–Hampton Roads Business Journal’s Power List of people who shape and influence the region of over 1.6 million people. The editor noted Dragas’ tenacity and called for her to apply her leadership in helping the community combat challenges of economic growth, education, and workforce development.[12]
Other positions[edit]
Dragas has served on the Virginia State Transportation Board, which makes decisions on state spending and transportation strategy.[13] Dragas has also served as a director of the utility corporation Dominion Resources since 2010, and has served on their audit committee.[14] She was appointed to the Virginia State Council of Higher Education and the Commonwealth Transportation board by former governor Mark Warner.[15]
UVA Board of Visitors[edit]
First term[edit]
Dragas was appointed as a member of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors by then Governor Tim Kaine in 2008.[16] She became rector of the board on July 1, 2011,[1] and was the first woman ever to be elected to the post.[17]
It’s been noted that Dragas’ state service was uncontroversial[18] until she made headlines in June 2012 as part of the resignation of UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan. Sullivan announced her resignation as president in early June after only two years in the position, citing "philosophical differences" with the Board of Visitors as her reasoning. Media outlets had reported that the rift between Sullivan and the board may have been, in part, due to Dragas' viewpoint that the university was facing serious financial challenges, and that the administration would need to explore fiscally conservative solutions, something Sullivan was not actively pursuing.[19]
A Washington Post story and a UVA student newspaper story had both claimed that Dragas organized the support necessary to oust Sullivan as president.[20] After the resignation, Dragas assured the community that the board was unified in its actions,[21] but some board members later claimed that they had no knowledge of the Sullivan decision until just before her resignation.[22] A former board member, Randal Kirk, publicly stated that he and others believed that Sullivan was the wrong pick from the start.[4] Public records later revealed that a super-majority of the board supported the change in leadership based on personnel reasons.[23] Dragas became the center of attention for those who supported Sullivan in their expression of dismay. According to a public records release, there were over 450 e-mails sent calling for Dragas to resign as rector.[24] Additionally, the faculty senate of UVA passed a resolution supporting Sullivan and expressing a lack of confidence in Dragas.[25] A newspaper report would later reveal that Sullivan’s supporters, mobilized by John O. “Dubby” Wynne, a former UVA rector who had originally hired Sullivan, had established “a ‘war room’ on grounds, where they organized a counterattack, focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members.”[26]
Following the vote, Dragas offered to meet with the faculty senate to discuss the matter, and a meeting took place on June 18, 2012. According to a statement by the faculty senate, the meeting was "cordial," but the faculty senate still demanded both the reinstatement of Sullivan and the resignation of Dragas.[27] As the situation escalated, Governor Bob McDonnell made a statement that if the Board of Visitors did not resolve the issue by their June 26 meeting, he would use his power of appointment to replace all of the board members.[28] At the June 26th meeting, the board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president.[29][30] While e-mails show that Dragas had considered resigning from her position as rector during the height of the situation,[31] she was subsequently reappointed to another term on the board by Governor McDonnell,[32] and has released a joint statement with Sullivan to demonstrate a shared commitment to moving on to solving the university's problems.[33]
Reconfirmation[edit]
Dragas was reconfirmed in January 2013. A March 2, 2013 Washington Post article reported that days after Virginia lawmakers confirmed Dragas’s reappointment to the board in January, the rector sent the president a lengthy and detailed list of goals to meet this school year. Sullivan claimed that the letter was inappropriate and constituted micromanagement.[34] The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) issued a report on March 14, 2013 criticizing the actions of the Board in general and Dragas in particular. The report stated that Dragas was not prepared for the disruptive influence of online education, that she had previously made uninformed statements, and that she seemed inexperienced in her position.[35][36][37] [32] It was noted that the report contained “multiple errors of fact.”[38] The American Council of Trustees and Alumni later praised the work of Dragas and the Board, stating that “If students are to receive a quality and affordable education in Virginia, it is the trustees who are going to have to press for, measure, and demand results."[39] Dragas’ financial support of the university has been documented, noting that she has donated nearly half a million dollars to the university, “but she considers herself a voice for the state's lower- and middle-income families,” added one news report.[40] In April 2013 Dragas was on the losing end of a 14-2 vote to raise tuition, claiming that the rise in tuition was putting the school on an unsustainable track. Dragas argued that tuition was rising faster than the income of Virginia families, so could become a barrier to post-secondary education.[41][42]
End of tenure[edit]
The Washington Post wrote that the ouster of Sullivan served to be beneficial for the university in terms of developing an attitude in favor of long term change.[43] In an exit interview from the position, Dragas stated that, "I believe we did the right thing in that we pushed for needed change ... We did it the wrong way in that we misunderstood that when you're going to try to solve thorne-y problems at a high-profile, public institution, you need to communicate a lot -- a lot more than we did -- and with a lot of people. And that was a lesson that I, in particular, and the board learned the hard way."[44] Her term as Rector ended at the end of June 2013,[45] though she remains a member of the board.[46]
In August 2013, Dragas was one of only two members of the Board of Visitors to vote against scaling back the university’s financial aid program, Access U.Va., which assured low-income students could graduate without debt.[47] The U.Va. Student Council submitted a letter echoing Dragas, requesting the program be maintained as it has operated for nine years.[48] Following the decision, Ms. Dragas maintained her opposition to the measure stating that, “[t]his action raises the cost of a UVa degree substantially for students from low-income families, hurting our diversity and coming at a time when we are already seen as elitist and unwelcoming.”[49] Some alumni and students have begun organizing support and sending emails to administrators in an effort to reverse the decision.
In September 2013, Dragas was noted for further expressing her opposition to tuition increases in the aftermath of a meeting between foundation representatives, administrators, deans and some board members who are advocates for raising in-state student tuition.[50] Later in the Fall at a November meeting, Dragas urged her fellow board members to delay approving elements of a new strategic plan, reiterating a need for more discussion on the plan’s potential impacts to tuition and financial aid.[51] Dragas specifically raised a concern about several years of double-digit tuition increases,[51] following comments for the university’s president that the possibility of tuition increases have not been ruled out to pay for parts of the strategic plan, especially improvements to curriculum and student engagement.[52]
Ms. Dragas was featured in Hampton Road Magazine’s list of “10 Leading Ladies” featuring the advice of powerful and inspiring women. She further mentioned the importance of affordable tuition by attributing her success and inspiration to the fact that she and her family “were able to afford the cost of a life-changing undergraduate and graduate education at the University of Virginia."[53]
Advocacy on Affordability[edit]
Throughout 2014, Dragas was further recognized for her advocacy of affordable higher education.[12] Dragas has been joined by other members of the Board in raising concerns that the university has relied too much on yearly tuition increases to backfill stagnant state funding, lack of strategic planning, and declining research.[54]
Dragas and fellow board members have also pointed to the university’s lack of a long-term financial plan as one reason for the continued escalation of tuition.[55] In response, in June 2014, the UVa Board of Visitors set up a special subcommittee to work on a long-range plan targeting affordability for students.[55]
During a June meeting of the UVa Board of Visitors, Dragas again raised the issue of the University’s public mission to provide affordable access to Virginians, arguing that board members owe their primary duty of loyalty to the public and then to the University.[56] A newspaper article on the meeting pointed to tuition increases, as an example, which may limit access to Virginians with lower incomes but help the university administration avoid difficult budget decisions.[56] One Virginia newspaper, the Daily Progress, cheered “Hooray for Helen Dragas”, and editorialized that Dragas was “spot-on in saying that the University of Virginia, including its governing board, should put the public interest first.”[57] Calling her “right on the money on these issues”, the Progress also agreed with Dragas that a proposed code of conduct muzzling Board member expression of dissenting views would be an unrighteous decision for a public institution.[57]
Personal life[edit]
Dragas lives in Virginia Beach, Virginia. She is married to Lewis Webb, an attorney; they have three children.[58]

Early life and career[edit]
Education[edit]
Dragas attended the University of Virginia and graduated with a B.A. in economics and foreign affairs in 1984. She also graduated from the Darden Graduate School of Business Administration in 1988.[1][2] By the early 1990s Dragas had become the President of the Tidewater Mortgage Bankers Association.[3]
The Dragas Companies[edit]
The Dragas Companies is a southeastern Virginia real estate development and building company founded by Dragas' father and uncle, George and Mark Dragas, in 1968. Helen Dragas’ first job, as a teenager, was interviewing customers at her family's company about their purchases.[4] Helen Dragas was named president and CEO of the Dragas Companies in 1996 and has remained in that position since. Under her tenure, the company has received numerous local awards, and three national awards: the Lee Evans Award for Building Management Excellence in 1999, and the 2009 Lee Evans Award for Management Excellence in 2009, and the Best Builders Award from Builder Magazine, also in 2009.[5] It is now the region's largest homebuilder,[6] with a focus of improving upon the quality of low-price homes in the area.[7]
In 2007 the Dragas Companies donated $1.5 million to the cities of Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Chesapeake for their use in dealing with homelessness and improving education for children in poverty.[8] In 2009 the Dragas Companies spent over $5 million to voluntarily remediate Chinese drywall that was installed by a subcontractor in over 70 homes without Dragas' knowledge.[9] Helen Dragas was named Virginia Beach's 2009 First Citizen.[10] She was also featured by The Virginian-Pilot in a 2010 article about successful female homebuilders and their achievements in the workplace.[11]
In 2014, Dragas earned a top-15 spot in the Inside Business–Hampton Roads Business Journal’s Power List of people who shape and influence the region of over 1.6 million people. The editor noted Dragas’ tenacity and called for her to apply her leadership in helping the community combat challenges of economic growth, education, and workforce development.[12]
Other positions[edit]
Dragas has served on the Virginia State Transportation Board, which makes decisions on state spending and transportation strategy.[13] Dragas has also served as a director of the utility corporation Dominion Resources since 2010, and has served on their audit committee.[14] She was appointed to the Virginia State Council of Higher Education and the Commonwealth Transportation board by former governor Mark Warner.[15]
UVA Board of Visitors[edit]
First term[edit]
Dragas was appointed as a member of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors by then Governor Tim Kaine in 2008.[16] She became rector of the board on July 1, 2011,[1] and was the first woman ever to be elected to the post.[17]
It’s been noted that Dragas’ state service was uncontroversial[18] until she made headlines in June 2012 as part of the resignation of UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan. Sullivan announced her resignation as president in early June after only two years in the position, citing "philosophical differences" with the Board of Visitors as her reasoning. Media outlets had reported that the rift between Sullivan and the board may have been, in part, due to Dragas' viewpoint that the university was facing serious financial challenges, and that the administration would need to explore fiscally conservative solutions, something Sullivan was not actively pursuing.[19]
A Washington Post story and a UVA student newspaper story had both claimed that Dragas organized the support necessary to oust Sullivan as president.[20] After the resignation, Dragas assured the community that the board was unified in its actions,[21] but some board members later claimed that they had no knowledge of the Sullivan decision until just before her resignation.[22] A former board member, Randal Kirk, publicly stated that he and others believed that Sullivan was the wrong pick from the start.[4] Public records later revealed that a super-majority of the board supported the change in leadership based on personnel reasons.[23] Dragas became the center of attention for those who supported Sullivan in their expression of dismay. According to a public records release, there were over 450 e-mails sent calling for Dragas to resign as rector.[24] Additionally, the faculty senate of UVA passed a resolution supporting Sullivan and expressing a lack of confidence in Dragas.[25] A newspaper report would later reveal that Sullivan’s supporters, mobilized by John O. “Dubby” Wynne, a former UVA rector who had originally hired Sullivan, had established “a ‘war room’ on grounds, where they organized a counterattack, focusing on influential alumni and wavering board members.”[26]
Following the vote, Dragas offered to meet with the faculty senate to discuss the matter, and a meeting took place on June 18, 2012. According to a statement by the faculty senate, the meeting was "cordial," but the faculty senate still demanded both the reinstatement of Sullivan and the resignation of Dragas.[27] As the situation escalated, Governor Bob McDonnell made a statement that if the Board of Visitors did not resolve the issue by their June 26 meeting, he would use his power of appointment to replace all of the board members.[28] At the June 26th meeting, the board unanimously voted to reinstate Sullivan as president.[29][30] While e-mails show that Dragas had considered resigning from her position as rector during the height of the situation,[31] she was subsequently reappointed to another term on the board by Governor McDonnell,[32] and has released a joint statement with Sullivan to demonstrate a shared commitment to moving on to solving the university's problems.[33]
Reconfirmation[edit]
Dragas was reconfirmed in January 2013. A March 2, 2013 Washington Post article reported that days after Virginia lawmakers confirmed Dragas’s reappointment to the board in January, the rector sent the president a lengthy and detailed list of goals to meet this school year. Sullivan claimed that the letter was inappropriate and constituted micromanagement.[34] The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) issued a report on March 14, 2013 criticizing the actions of the Board in general and Dragas in particular. The report stated that Dragas was not prepared for the disruptive influence of online education, that she had previously made uninformed statements, and that she seemed inexperienced in her position.[35][36][37] [32] It was noted that the report contained “multiple errors of fact.”[38] The American Council of Trustees and Alumni later praised the work of Dragas and the Board, stating that “If students are to receive a quality and affordable education in Virginia, it is the trustees who are going to have to press for, measure, and demand results."[39] Dragas’ financial support of the university has been documented, noting that she has donated nearly half a million dollars to the university, “but she considers herself a voice for the state's lower- and middle-income families,” added one news report.[40] In April 2013 Dragas was on the losing end of a 14-2 vote to raise tuition, claiming that the rise in tuition was putting the school on an unsustainable track. Dragas argued that tuition was rising faster than the income of Virginia families, so could become a barrier to post-secondary education.[41][42]
End of tenure[edit]
The Washington Post wrote that the ouster of Sullivan served to be beneficial for the university in terms of developing an attitude in favor of long term change.[43] In an exit interview from the position, Dragas stated that, "I believe we did the right thing in that we pushed for needed change ... We did it the wrong way in that we misunderstood that when you're going to try to solve thorne-y problems at a high-profile, public institution, you need to communicate a lot -- a lot more than we did -- and with a lot of people. And that was a lesson that I, in particular, and the board learned the hard way."[44] Her term as Rector ended at the end of June 2013,[45] though she remains a member of the board.[46]
In August 2013, Dragas was one of only two members of the Board of Visitors to vote against scaling back the university’s financial aid program, Access U.Va., which assured low-income students could graduate without debt.[47] The U.Va.

History
Mark & George Dragas
Forty-five years can be forever in the construction industry. In our case, it spans two generations of a local family determined to help others in the community fulfill the American dream of homeownership. Our first company was Dragas Mortgage Company, founded in 1968 by George Dragas, a first generation American and son of Greek immigrants who believed owning a home was part of the American dream. A few years later, George formed a partnership with his brother Mark to develop and build reasonably priced homes and attractive condominium communities in Hampton Roads.
From the start, the Dragas brothers believed that providing value would build their business and their reputation. They were right. The Dragas name became associated with quality and recognized for integrity, innovation and a commitment to excellence—long before “excellence” became just another industry buzzword.
Helen Dragas
Those traditions continue today under a second generation of Dragas leadership. George’s daughter Helen E. Dragas began learning about her family’s emphasis on value at the family dinner table. By the age of 13, Helen had her first “official” position with the company—as marketing agent. During many summers and school breaks Helen visited homeowners door-to-door. Even as a teenager, she knew that understanding the Dragas customer would always be key to the company’s success.
Over the years, Helen has worn many hats in the family business. In 1996, she followed in her father’s footsteps and was named President and Chief Executive Officer. Today, with the benefit of years with the company in many different positions, Helen has fine-tuned the company’s vision and has continued the family tradition of providing value. And she’s done it the way her family always did—by building strong relationships with homeowners, employees, government officials and industry professionals. Under Helen’s leadership, The Dragas Companies has received dozens of civic, government and industry awards, including the prestigious America’s Best Builder award from Builder magazine, one of the nation’s leading housing publications.

Dragas  July 6, 2016      Helen E. Dragas is shown in June 2012 at a meeting of the University of Virginia Board of Visitors. Dragas, who led an unsuccessful effort that year to oust U-Va. President Teresa A. Sullivan, recently left the board after eight years. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)  Helen E. Dragas, a Hampton Roads businesswoman, was appointed to the University of Virginia’s governing board in 2008 by then-Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D). She was reappointed by then-Gov. Robert F. McDonnell (R) in 2012. She led the Board of Visitors as U-Va.’s first female rector from 2011 to 2013. Her term on the board ended June 30. Here she offers a parting viewpoint on the direction of the public flagship university.   [Key player in the 2012 leadership drama at U-Va. leaves the school’s board]   By Helen E. Dragas Regular citizens here and around the world are expressing disapproval of their lack of control over crushing policies made by the disconnected elite. With national student loan debt exceeding $1.3 trillion, American students and families must feel frustrations similar to those vented across the Atlantic in the recent Brexit vote. After an eight-year term on the Board of Visitors at the University of Virginia, I can confidently attest that this disconnect is alive and well at the commonwealth’s flagship. Despite significant growth in state and federal funding, the board has voted to raise tuition for new students by 30 percent since 2013. Administrators regularly seek — and get — annual raises for faculty well above the rate of inflation. While some secretarial and administrative staff earn more than the governor of Virginia, the median family income in the state remains stuck in the mid-$60,000’s. It’s easy for accomplished and wealthy board members — including me — to sit around a fancy oval table and pass judgment about what’s affordable or what’s not. But we don’t walk in the shoes of everyday Virginia parents struggling to keep body and soul together and a child (or more) in college. And accolades of “Best Value” regularly received by U-Va. fall flat on the ears of students for whom all choices are a financial strain. Earlier this year, just before leaving home for a Board of Visitors event, a Google alert linked me to a story about a U-Va. student forced to beg online for help to pay her tuition and to eat. In anybody’s book that should be shameful. A keen sense of moral unease deadened my appetite as I later dined with my fellow board members, administrators and deans on crab cakes, filet mignon, and designer desserts in a luxury country inn owned by the university. Without doubt, the forces of growing income inequality, increasing diversity, soaring costs, technological changes and global influences have come home to roost in Charlottesville. In fact, the commonwealth is a microcosm of the country. We are well off and not. We are black and white and brown and every other color of the rainbow. We are global citizens. But there’s one thing Virginia’s families have in common, and that’s the desire to create opportunities for the next generation to grow and prosper, and to do so without mortgaging the future. Its founding DNA imprints U-Va. as a very public institution with what should be a very public responsibility. Yet since 2009, the university has raised in-state tuition by 74 percent, cut grant aid to the poorest Virginians, formed an administrative committee to explore secession from the state, hired a private university governance consultant for $200,000, spent more than $100 million on financial aid to out-of-state students, raised the net price for some Virginia families to subsidize others, and proposed gagging board members from talking to legislators, the press and the public. Thousands of Virginia students who seek admission are denied a coveted spot every year. The University of Virginia is slowly being privatized. As a native Virginian whose family’s tax dollars have supported the commonwealth for decades, watching this process unfold from a front row seat has been excruciatingly painful. At our June meeting, administrators revealed their coffers include a $2.3 billion pot of reserves, surpluses and earnings that for years has been hidden in plain sight, loosely labeled as necessary to support operations. Now, through financial maneuvering, this treasury has been liberated expressly to support strategic initiatives that will enhance the university’s reputation. As administrators requested a series of board actions to facilitate that change, members were not apprised of the large sum at stake. Only later did we learn that these moves had created a $2.3 billion slush fund. Privately referred to as “unfound money” (that is, unfound by legislators, the press, and — as a result — the general public), this astounding sum could run the entire University Academic Division for a year and a half. It would pay the four-year tuition bills for 44,000 Virginia students. It is 20 percent more than the market value of all of U-Va.’s 200-year buildup of educational and general program buildings and facilities. A conservative estimate of its annual earnings potential — $100 million — could be used to cut the tuition of all in-state undergraduates by 70 percent. While others and I have made futile requests for more detail on these funds — with a top administrator recently citing fear that the originating sources would try to reclaim them — credit belongs to the current rector, William Goodwin, for tenaciously pressing administrators for transparency about this astounding accumulation. But to consider hoarding a multi-billion-dollar slush fund for pet projects doesn’t reflect reality. By way of example, one recent proposal suggested a $50 million program for self-care training to include journaling, meditation and yoga for nursing students. Proper public use of this public gold mine (and funds received by the university from any source become public dollars) could put an excellent education within reach of more middle- and lower-income students. Look outside. Many of Virginia’s families are already drowning in tuition debt that robs graduates of the opportunity to gain basic independence, let alone start small businesses that Virginia so desperately needs for economic growth. It’s wrong when reputational rankings in magazines matter more than serving Virginians. But when public universities are run like private academic playgrounds, and boards act as unelected taxing authorities, perhaps it’s time for a higher power to weigh in. I believe there’s a better way to do business in Virginia. Governor McAuliffe and the General Assembly should make strengthening transparency and accountability a priority for the 2017 session through a few simple measures. First, they should ensure that the women and men appointed to serve our public colleges understand and pledge to uphold their primary duty to Virginia citizens. Requiring significantly more rigorous orientation and training delivered by independent, objective sources would help board members see through a wider lens than that of administrators. Having witnessed abuse of Virginia’s sunshine laws by out-of-state appointees in order to increase in-state tuition by double digits, I believe legislators should stipulate that only Virginians be allowed to serve as board officers and chairs of certain critical committees. The so-called “legislative liaisons” employed directly by colleges and universities should be subject to the same registration and reporting laws as all lobbyists, and the records of all officers — including college presidents — should be subject to Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act. Finally, requiring public comment periods at board meetings and creating accountability back to the taxpayers they serve would bring higher education into the modern world of governance. These steps alone could help ensure that U-Va. remains true to its 200-year-old mandate. In the meantime, its leaders should voluntarily reclaim its historic, public heritage by denouncing the rankings and embracing an identity that is more diverse, more affordable, more accessible and more nimble in adjusting to the dynamics of today’s learners. Let’s keep our public treasures excellent, affordable and truly public.

History
Mark & George Dragas
Forty-five years can be forever in the construction industry. In our case, it spans two generations of a local family determined to help others in the community fulfill the American dream of homeownership. Our first company was Dragas Mortgage Company, founded in 1968 by George Dragas, a first generation American and son of Greek immigrants who believed owning a home was part of the American dream. A few years later, George formed a partnership with his brother Mark to develop and build reasonably priced homes and attractive condominium communities in Hampton Roads.
From the start, the Dragas brothers believed that providing value would build their business and their reputation. They were right. The Dragas name became associated with quality and recognized for integrity, innovation and a commitment to excellence—long before “excellence” became just another industry buzzword.
Helen Dragas
Those traditions continue today under a second generation of Dragas leadership. George’s daughter Helen E. Dragas began learning about her family’s emphasis on value at the family dinner table. By the age of 13, Helen had her first “official” position with the company—as marketing agent. During many summers and school breaks Helen visited homeowners door-to-door. Even as a teenager, she knew that understanding the Dragas customer would always be key to the company’s success.
Over the years, Helen has worn many hats in the family business. In 1996, she followed in her father’s footsteps and was named President and Chief Executive Officer. Today, with the benefit of years with the company in many different positions, Helen has fine-tuned the company’s vision and has continued the family tradition of providing value. And she’s done it the way her family always did—by building strong relationships with homeowners, employees, government officials and industry professionals. Under Helen’s leadership, The Dragas Companies has received dozens of civic, government and industry awards, including the prestigious America’s Best Builder award from Builder magazine, one of the nation’s leading housing publications.
 


COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
Holiday Toy Drive
‘Twas the season of giving and the ForKids Organization geared up for their annual Holiday Toy Drive. With a goal of reaching hundreds upon hundreds of kids, we once again participated in the annual drive. We hosted collections at our sales centers and corporate office with the hopes of gathering the best games, puzzles and sporting equipment Hampton Roads had to offer. When it was all said and done, we raised an overwhelming amount of toys and gift cards for the homeless children of the ForKids program!
If you’d like to donate or volunteer for the ForKids organization or even lend a hand at their thrift store, Good Mojo, head over to their website to learn how to get involved with this award-winning organization. –December 2016

ForKids Backpack Drive
Each year, the ForKids organization hosts a backpack drive to benefit children returning to school in Hampton Roads. We’re pleased to once again participate in the event and stuff over 50 bookbags! We’re proud to support ForKids in their mission to stop the cycle of homelessness in Hampton Roads! –August 2016

Cycle for Survival: The Race Against Cancer

Cycle for Survival is an indoor stationary spin cycling event and funds raised from this event benefit Rare Cancer Research. A maximum of 8 people per team can reserve 1 bike for a 4-hour duration with each member pedaling for 30 minutes. The Dragas Companies sponsored a bike for this event, and 8 pedaling enthusiasts made up #TeamDragas. The team pedaled away—riding towards the ultimate goal of answers and cures.
ForKids Inc.: Most Successful Art Auction…Ever
The 14th Annual ForKids Art Auction & Casino Night was a huge success! The night was filled with whimsical characters that we’ve grown to love since childhood. Thing 1 and Thing 2, the Grinch, and dozens of Cat in the Hat impersonators filled the Waterside Marriott for the much-anticipated event. The children and volunteers of ForKids, Inc. decked the room in typical Seuss-ical fashion with Truffula Tree centerpieces, popular Seuss books, and Thing 1 and Thing 2-themed bidding paddles. The main event was when the bidding started – trips, parties, cars and kids’ artwork went for thousands of dollars! The eager donors kept their biding paddles up all night! For the third year in a row, The Dragas Companies had the honor of being the title sponsor of the ForKids Art Auction. We’re looking forward to what next year has in store! –March 2015
Dr. Seuss: The Teacher of Practical Life

Today we celebrate the 111th birthday of Dr. Seuss. Dr. Seuss has written 44 children’s book that have been translated into 15 different languages. His witty use of small words and creation of memorable characters has sparked the love of learning in kids around the world. The children of ForKids, Inc. are no different. This year, the organization’s Art Auction & Casino Night will feature artwork made by kids of the program – in a Seuss-ical fashion. For the third year, The Dragas Companies is proud to be the title sponsor of this event. If you’re looking for a fun night for a worthy cause, contact ForKids at 757-622-6400 to reserve your seat!
Making the Season a Little Brighter

After a week of “elf-ing” around, our team came together and stuffed festive toy boxes for the families of ForKids, Inc. Nostalgia settled in as we reminisced on childhood memories made with Easy Bake Ovens, fire trucks, and those green Ninja Turtles. Our hope is that the children of this award-winning organization will one day stand where we stand as they think back on the good times they had with these toys. We are more than pleased to have been a part of the ForKids Holiday Toy Drive. Thank you to everyone who helped us to make this season just a little bit jollier for kids and families around Hampton Roads. It’s not too late to donate toys! There are numerous toy drives taking place throughout Hampton Roads. Contact a local shelter, nonprofit organization, or mentorship program to see how you can help. –December 2014
We Build and Invest in the American Dream
Labor Day is fast approaching and with it comes big yellow buses and huge backpacks on tiny backs. As families across Hampton Roads prepare for the coming school year, the ForKids Organization once again offered us the chance to invest in a child’s education through their annual backpack drive. Without hesitation, the entire Dragas Team came together and stuffed 55 backpacks to the brim! Like our President, Helen Dragas, we understand the power of education and we were thrilled to play a part in the lives of so many youth.
