Strategies







Long-Biased ‘Flagship’ Strategy
Ardsley's long-biased flagship strategy dates back to March 1987. The investment universe of the strategy is global with an emphasis on US-based technology, telecom, life sciences, energy and alternative energy companies. The strategy uses a concentrated book approach with the top ten core holdings generally representing Ardsley's best ideas and 40-50% of the portfolio. Returns are enhanced by the short portfolio and by the opportunistic trading of stocks and options.  Sector specialist analysts use a fundamental, bottom-up research approach to identify rapidly growing companies for core portfolio investments. The Portfolio Managers are responsible for portfolio construction and risk management. 


Renewable Energy/Clean Tech Strategy
Ardsley's renewable energy strategy, launched in July 2006, employs a fundamentally driven research approach to identify asymmetric risk/reward opportunities across all market capitalizations and geographies within the renewable energy sector and related areas. The primary objective the strategy is to generate superior returns through a portfolio of long and short public equity investments, regardless of economic conditions. The Portfolio Manager has a long history of successfully managing capital and has worked at Ardsley for more than 12 years and has developed a track record of superior returns. The strategy seeks to invest in companies which provide solutions to the global energy and natural resource problem and whose technologies offer alternatives or more efficient use of natural resources. The investment process combines company specific research, sector analysis and a top-down macro economic outlook to identify the best opportunities within each subsector and to isolate individual alpha generating shorts. Hands-on, active portfolio management, which includes balancing and shifting sub-sector exposures within the renewable energy universe, are at the core of our risk management.

Healthcare Strategy
Ardsley's healthcare strategy, launched in February 2012, is a long/short equity strategy focused on investing in opportunities across all healthcare sub-sectors and related areas. The strategy seeks to identify the regulatory, global macro economic and sub-sector specific cycles impacting the healthcare industry and combine it with rigorous bottom-up analysis to generate absolute returns. The Portfolio Management team maintains a value/GARP orientation and combines that with fundamental and catalytic-driven, opportunistic shorts. The primary objective is to produce superior returns while maintaining low volatility through a long-short portfolio of healthcare equity investments. Our Portfolio Managers have a long history of successfully managing capital and have developed a track record of superior returns derived from a combined 40+ years of direct healthcare investing experience and sector coverage. Healthcare sector investment performance has been a major contributing factor to Ardsley's success over the years with generally 20-40% of our flagship strategy invested in the sector at any given time. The investment process combines company specific research, sector analysis and a top-down macro economic outlook to identify the best opportunities within each subsector and isolate individual companies, with deteriorating fundamentals, as alpha shorts. 


Global Technology Strategy
Ardsley's world information technology strategy, launched in February 2011, is a global long-short equity strategy with a specific focus on the technology sector. The goal of the strategy is to produce superior returns while maintaining low volatility. We believe superior returns are derived from deep knowledge of the sectors of coverage gained from the strategy manager's personal background in technology development and an acquired ability to identify and anticipate market share shifts and transact accordingly. The fundamental research we perform on each investment gives us an appreciation of competitive differentiation in our portfolio companies' operations.
