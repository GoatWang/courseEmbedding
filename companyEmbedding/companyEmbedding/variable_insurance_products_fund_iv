Other Information





The following is a summary of the inputs used, as of March 31, 2011, involving the Fund's assets and liabilities carried at fair value. The
inputs or methodology used for valuing securities may not be an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. For
more information on valuation inputs, and their aggregation into the levels used in the table below, please refer to the Investment Valuation
section at the end of this listing.

Income Tax Information





At March 31, 2011, the cost of investment securities for income tax purposes was $26,734,803. Net unrealized appreciation aggregated
$3,278,709, of which $4,161,283 related to appreciated investment securities and $882,574 related to depreciated investment securities.





Investment Valuation





Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. Security transactions are accounted for as of
trade date. The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market
prices or quotations are not readily available or reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with
which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value
calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities. The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for
identical investments. Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates,
prepayment speeds etc.). Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available).
Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. Valuation techniques
used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows.





Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price
or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and
are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities
are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American
Depositary Receipts, futures contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are
used and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market
activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.





For additional information on the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to
the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

section at the end of this listing.

Income Tax Information





At March 31, 2011, the cost of investment securities for income tax purposes was $23,783,289. Net unrealized appreciation aggregated
$1,398,843, of which $2,538,033 related to appreciated investment securities and $1,139,190 related to depreciated investment
securities.





Investment Valuation





Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. Security transactions are accounted for as of
trade date. The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market
prices or quotations are not readily available or reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with
which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value
calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities. The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for
identical investments. Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates,
prepayment speeds etc.). Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available).
Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. Valuation techniques
used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows.





Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price
or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and
are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities
are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American
Depositary Receipts, futures contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are
used and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market
activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.





Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net asset value each business day
and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.





For additional information on the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to
the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

and the proceeds of sales may include securities received or delivered through corporate actions or exchanges.





Income Tax Information





At March 31, 2011, the cost of investment securities for income tax purposes was $80,231,641. Net unrealized appreciation aggregated
$20,972,454, of which $22,143,056 related to appreciated investment securities and $1,170,602 related to depreciated investment
securities.





Investment Valuation





Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. Security transactions are accounted for as of
trade date. The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market
prices or quotations are not readily available or reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with
which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value
calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities. The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for
identical investments. Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates,
prepayment speeds etc.). Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available).
Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. Valuation techniques
used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows.





Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price
or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and
are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities
are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American
Depositary Receipts, futures contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are
used and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market
activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.





Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net asset value each business day
and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.





For additional information on the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to
the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

Income Tax Information





At March 31, 2011, the cost of investment securities for income tax purposes was $402,308,708. Net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $134,067,769, of which $142,447,692 related to appreciated investment securities and $8,379,923 related to depreciated
investment securities.





Investment Valuation





Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. Security transactions are accounted for as of
trade date. The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market
prices or quotations are not readily available or reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining value may include market or security specific events, changes in interest
rates and credit quality. The frequency with which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant
extent. The value used for net asset value calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities. The
Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level
1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical investments. Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds etc.). Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on
the best information available). Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure
hierarchy. Valuation techniques used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows.





Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price
or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and
are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities
are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American
Depositary Receipts, futures contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are
used and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market
activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.





Debt securities, including restricted securities, are valued based on evaluated prices received from independent pricing services or from
dealers who make markets in such securities. For corporate bonds, pricing services utilize matrix pricing which considers yield or price of
bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy.





Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net asset value each business day
and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.





When independent prices are unavailable or unreliable, debt securities may be valued utilizing pricing matrices which consider similar
factors that would be used by independent pricing services. These are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy but may be Level 3
depending on the circumstances.





For additional information on the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to
the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

any Security or Instrument where a change in the pricing level occurred from the beginning to the end of the period. The cost of purchases
and the proceeds of sales may include securities received or delivered through corporate actions or exchanges.





Income Tax Information





At March 31, 2011, the cost of investment securities for income tax purposes was $27,667,540. Net unrealized appreciation aggregated
$5,470,555, of which $5,938,494 related to appreciated investment securities and $467,939 related to depreciated investment securities.





Investment Valuation





Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. Security transactions are accounted for as of
trade date. The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market
prices or quotations are not readily available or reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with
which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value
calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities. The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for
identical investments. Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates,
prepayment speeds etc.). Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available).
Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. Valuation techniques
used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows.





Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price
or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and
are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities
are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American
Depositary Receipts, futures contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are
used and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market
activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.





Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net asset value each business day
and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.





For additional information on the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to
the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

Other Information





All investments are categorized as Level 1 under the Fair Value Hierarchy. The inputs or methodology used for valuing securities may not
be an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. For more information on valuation inputs please refer to the
Investment Valuation section at the end of this listing.





Income Tax Information





At March 31, 2011, the cost of investment securities for income tax purposes was $106,812,330. Net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $25,734,557, of which $26,419,793 related to appreciated investment securities and $685,236 related to depreciated
investment securities.





Investment Valuation





Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. Security transactions are accounted for as of
trade date. The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market
prices or quotations are not readily available or reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with
which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value
calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities. The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for
identical investments. Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates,
prepayment speeds etc.). Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available).
Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. Valuation techniques
used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows.





Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price
or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and
are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities
are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American
Depositary Receipts, futures contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are
used and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market
activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.





Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net asset value each business day
and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.





For additional information on the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to
the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

Income Tax Information





At March 31, 2011, the cost of investment securities for income tax purposes was $41,831,617. Net unrealized appreciation aggregated
$6,211,635, of which $7,019,184 related to appreciated investment securities and $807,549 related to depreciated investment securities.





Investment Valuation





Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. Security transactions are accounted for as of
trade date. The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market
prices or quotations are not readily available or reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with
which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value
calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities. The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for
identical investments. Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates,
prepayment speeds etc.). Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available).
Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. Valuation techniques
used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows.





Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price
or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and
are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities
are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American
Depositary Receipts, futures contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are
used and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market
activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.





Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net asset value each business day
and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.





For additional information on the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to
the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

Income Tax Information





At March 31, 2011, the cost of investment securities for income tax purposes was $213,523,861. Net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $52,470,133, of which $58,609,096 related to appreciated investment securities and $6,138,963 related to depreciated
investment securities.





Investment Valuation





Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. Security transactions are accounted for as of
trade date. The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market
prices or quotations are not readily available or reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with
which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value
calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities. The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for
identical investments. Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates,
prepayment speeds etc.). Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available).
Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. Valuation techniques
used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows.





Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price
or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and
are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities
are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American
Depositary Receipts, futures contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are
used and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market
activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.





Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net asset value each business day
and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.





For additional information on the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to
the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

and the proceeds of sales may include securities received or delivered through corporate actions or exchanges.





Income Tax Information





At March 31, 2011, the cost of investment securities for income tax purposes was $179,224,451. Net unrealized appreciation
aggregated $50,153,707, of which $55,993,694 related to appreciated investment securities and $5,839,987 related to depreciated
investment securities.





Investment Valuation





Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. Security transactions are accounted for as of
trade date. The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market
prices or quotations are not readily available or reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining value may include market or security specific events, changes in interest
rates and credit quality. The frequency with which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant
extent. The value used for net asset value calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities. The
Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level
1 - quoted prices in active markets for identical investments. Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for
similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds etc.). Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on
the best information available). Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure
hierarchy. Valuation techniques used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows.





Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price
or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and
are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities
are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American
Depositary Receipts, futures contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are
used and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market
activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.





Debt securities, including restricted securities, are valued based on evaluated prices received from independent pricing services or from
dealers who make markets in such securities. For corporate bonds, pricing services utilize matrix pricing which considers yield or price of
bonds of comparable quality, coupon, maturity and type as well as dealer supplied prices and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy.





When independent prices are unavailable or unreliable, debt securities may be valued utilizing pricing matrices which consider similar
factors that would be used by independent pricing services. These are generally categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy but may be Level 3
depending on the circumstances.





Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net asset value each business day
and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.





For additional information on the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to
the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

Income Tax Information





At March 31, 2011, the cost of investment securities for income tax purposes was $29,624,750. Net unrealized appreciation aggregated
$542,277, of which $2,997,586 related to appreciated investment securities and $2,455,309 related to depreciated investment securities.





Investment Valuation





Investments are valued as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time on the last calendar day of the period. Security transactions are accounted for as of
trade date. The Fund uses independent pricing services approved by the Board of Trustees to value its investments. When current market
prices or quotations are not readily available or reliable, valuations may be determined in good faith in accordance with procedures
adopted by the Board of Trustees. Factors used in determining value may include market or security specific events. The frequency with
which these procedures are used cannot be predicted and they may be utilized to a significant extent. The value used for net asset value
calculation under these procedures may differ from published prices for the same securities. The Fund categorizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to value its investments into a disclosure hierarchy consisting of three levels. Level 1 - quoted prices in active markets for
identical investments. Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates,
prepayment speeds etc.). Level 3 - unobservable inputs (including the Fund's own assumptions based on the best information available).
Changes in valuation techniques may result in transfers in or out of an assigned level within the disclosure hierarchy. Valuation techniques
used to value the Fund's investments by major category are as follows.





Equity securities, including restricted securities, for which market quotations are readily available, are valued at the last reported sale price
or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded and
are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy. In the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available, securities
are valued at the last quoted bid price or may be valued using the last available price and are generally categorized as Level 2 in the
hierarchy. For foreign equity securities, when significant market or security specific events arise, comparisons to the valuation of American
Depositary Receipts, futures contracts, Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and certain indexes as well as quoted prices for similar securities are
used and are categorized as Level 2 in the hierarchy in these circumstances. Utilizing these techniques may result in transfers between
Level 1 and Level 2. For restricted equity securities and private placements where observable inputs are limited, assumptions about market
activity and risk are used and are categorized as Level 3 in the hierarchy.





Investments in open-end mutual funds, including the Fidelity Central Funds, are valued at their closing net asset value each business day
and are categorized as Level 1 in the hierarchy.





For additional information on the Fund's policy regarding valuation of investments and other significant accounting policies, please refer to
the Fund's most recent semiannual or annual shareholder report.

When evaluating the purchase of a variable annuity, you should be aware that variable annuities are long-term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes and will fluctuate in value; annuities have limitations; and, investing involves market risk, including possible loss of principal.A variable annuity is a contract you buy from an insurance company. It's designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. It will fluctuate in value based on the performance of the underlying investment options. You should also know that all guarantees and protections of a variable annuity are subject to the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. They don't apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying investment options. Underlying subaccounts are only available as investment options in variable insurance contracts issued by life insurance companies. They are not offered directly to the general public.You may be charged a penalty if you take your money out early, if you're not yet 59½ (additional 10% tax penalty), or both. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees, and the expense of the underlying investment options.Variable products are sold by prospectus. Both the product prospectus and underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by writing to Nationwide Life Insurance Company, P.O. Box 182021, Columbus, OH 43218-2021. Before investing, carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Read the prospectuses carefully before investing.NFW-5008AONFW-4966AOHome Products Annuities Variable  Best of America IV
