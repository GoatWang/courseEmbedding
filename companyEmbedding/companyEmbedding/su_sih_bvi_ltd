Item
1.       Security and Issuer.
 
This Amendment No. 5 (the “Amendment”)
amends the Schedule 13D filed on April 19, 2010, as amended by Amendment No. 4 to the Schedule 13D filed on November 23, 2016 (as
amended, the “Prior Filing”) by the Reporting Persons relating to the common stock, par value $0.001 per share
(the “Shares”), of TIM Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) , a corporation organized under
the laws of Delaware, whose corporate office is located at 1665 Scenic Avenue, Suite 250, Costa Mesa, California 92626. Capitalized
terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given to them in the Prior Filing.
 
Item
4.       Purpose of Transaction.
 
Item 4 of the Prior Filing is hereby amended and restated in
its entirety as follows:
 
On February 27, 2017
(the “Relevant Date”), Su Sih (BVI) Limited (“Su Sih”) executed a sale of 4,000,000
Shares to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC in reliance on Rule 144 under the Act. The sale is expected to be consummated on March
2, 2017. Pursuant to the the Shareholders Agreement relating to the Company dated as of April 9, 2010, as amended on
September 14, 2012 and December 29, 2015 (attached as Exhibit A to the Prior Filing) (the
“Shareholders Agreement”), on February 28, 2017, the Tang Director delivered a written resignation from
the board of directors of the Company (the “Board”), conditioned upon the Tang Shareholders, Tang
Siblings, and their affiliates ceasing to collectively beneficially own Shares representing at least 9.9% of the total voting
power of the Company’s outstanding voting securities. Pursuant to such written resignation, the Tang Director will
remain a member of the Board until the next meeting of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board
(the “Committee”), which is scheduled to meet on May 10, 2017. At that Committee meeting, the
Tang Director’s resignation shall become immediately effective unless (i) the Committee agrees not to accept
such resignation and (ii) the Tang Director agrees to revoke his resignation.
 
In addition, unless terminated
earlier by unanimous written consent of the parties hereto, the Shareholders Agreement will terminate automatically on the 181st
day next following the time when the Tang Shareholders, Tang Siblings, and their affiliates (or any group containing one or more
of them) collectively beneficially own Share representing less than 9.9% of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding
voting securities.
 
As a result of the transactions
described herein, none of the Reporting Persons holds the Shares with any purpose, or with the effect, of changing or influencing
the control of the Company, or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having that purpose or effect.
 
As a result of the
transactions described herein, each of Mr. Henry Tang and MMLis  expected to cease to be the beneficial owner of more than
five percent of the Shares on March 2, 2017. The filing of this Amendment No. 5 constitutes an exit filing for each of
Mr. Henry Tang and MML.  
 
Except as set forth in this Amendment,
Mr. Hsiang Tang, Mr. Henry Tang, Su Sih and MML have no present plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any of the
transactions described in subparagraphs (a) through (j) of item 4 of Schedule 13D. Following the sale, Mr. Hsiang Tang and Mr.
Henry Tang may from time to time review their investment and, subject to the approval of the other directors of Su Sih (as set
forth in Schedule A to the Prior Filing) and in accordance with the restrictions of the Shareholders Agreement prior to its termination
as described above, decide (i) to acquire additional securities of the Company, through open market purchases, privately negotiated
transactions or otherwise, or (ii) to dispose of all or a portion of the securities of the Company owned by it in the open market,
in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such acquisition or disposition or other transaction would be made in compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations.
 
Item
5.       Interest in Securities
of the Issuer.
 
Item 5 of the Prior Filing is hereby amended and restated
in its entirety as follows:
 
The responses to Rows (7) through
(13) of the cover pages of this Amendment are hereby incorporated by reference in this Item 5. The information with respect to
Shares that may be deemed to be beneficially owned by each director and officer of Su Sih and MML are set forth on Schedules C
and D, respectively, hereto, which are incorporated herein by reference.
 


6 
 

 
Following
the sale of the Shares as described above, Su Sih beneficially owns 9,761,874 Shares. Through his 83.4% ownership interest in Su
Sih, Mr. Hsiang Tang is the beneficial owner of 8,141,680 of the Shares beneficially owned by Su Sih. MML is an entity whollyowned
and controlled by Mr. Henry Tang. Through his ownership of MML, which has a 16.6% ownership interest in Su Sih, Mr. Henry Tang
is the beneficial owner of 1,620,194 of the Shares beneficially owned by Su Sih.
 
As set forth above, each of
Mr. Henry Tang and MML  is expected to cease to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the Shares on March 2,
2017. The filing of this Amendment No. 5 constitutes an exit filing for each of Mr. Henry Tang and MML.
 
Mr. Henry Tang was appointed
as a director of Su Sih pursuant to a resolution of the directors of Su Sih dated August 20, 2013. On August 27, 2013, the directors
of Su Sih resolved to amend the Su Sih Articles of Association such that any acquisition by Su Sih of assets, or any sale, transfer,
lease, exchange or other disposition of Su Sih assets must be approved by all Su Sih directors. As a result of this amendment,
all potential future dispositions of the Shares beneficially owned by Su Sih will require the approval of all Su Sih directors.
As of the Relevant Date, and as set forth in Schedule A hereto, the directors of Su Sih were Mr. Hsiang Tang, Mr. Henry Tang, Mr.
Tang Chung Yen, Tom and Ms. Tang Ying Ming, Mai.
 
Except as disclosed in this Amendment,

A and B to the Prior Filing, beneficially own any Shares or have the right to acquire any Shares.

A and B to the Prior Filing, presently have the power to vote or to direct the vote or to dispose or direct the disposition of
any of the Shares that they may be deemed to beneficially own.
 
Except as disclosed in this Amendment,
none of Mr. Hsiang Tang, Mr. Henry Tang, Su Sih or MML, nor, to the best of their knowledge, any of the persons listed in Schedules
A and B to the Prior Filing, have effected any transaction in the Shares during the past 60 days.
 
To the best knowledge of Mr.
Hsiang, Tang ,Mr. Henry Tang, Su Sih and MML, no other person has the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends
from, or the proceeds from the sale of, the Shares beneficially owned by them.
 
Schedules C and D attached to
the Prior Filing shall be deleted in their entirety, and replaced with Schedules C and D attached to this Amendment.
 
Item
6.       Contracts, Arrangements,
Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.
 
Item 6 of the Prior Filing is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
 
The Su Sih Articles of Association,
as amended by director resolution on August 27, 2013, require that any acquisition by Su Sih of assets, or any sale, transfer,
lease, exchange or other disposition of Su Sih assets must be approved by all Su Sih directors. All potential future dispositions
of the Shares beneficially owned by Su Sih will require the approval of all Su Sih directors set forth in Schedule A to the Prior
Filing.
 
The Shareholders Agreement, dated
as of April 9, 2010 and originally filed as Exhibit B to the Schedule 13D filed on April 19, 2010, was amended on September 14,
2012 (such Shareholders Agreement and amendment are attached as Exhibit A to the Prior Filing). In addition to the original parties
to the Shareholders Agreement, Mr. Henry Tang is also subject to the Shareholders Agreement, as amended on September 14, 2012,
which, among other conditions and restrictions, limits the number of Shares that Su Sih may beneficially own or control. The Shareholders
Agreement will terminate automatically on the 181st day next following the time when the Tang Shareholders, Tang Siblings, and
their affiliates (or any group containing one or more of them) collectively beneficially own Share representing less than 9.9%
of the total voting power of the Company’s outstanding voting securities.
 


7 
 

 
Except as described in this Amendment,
neither the Reporting Persons nor, to the knowledge of the Reporting Persons, any of its executive officers or directors listed
on Schedule A to the Prior Filing, has any contract, arrangement, understanding or relationship (legal or otherwise) with any person
with respect to the Shares held by the Reporting Persons, including, but not limited to, transfer or voting of any of such securities,

loss, or the giving or withholding of proxies.
