ST. PAUL, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ) today announced that its Board of 
      Directors has implemented a leadership transition plan that capitalizes 
      on the strength of the St. Jude Medical management team. Effective 
      January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau will become President and Chief 
      Executive Officer (CEO) and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of 
      Directors. Daniel J. Starks, following a distinguished career as St. 
      Jude Medical’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, has 
      decided to retire from his position as President and Chief Executive 
      Officer and has been elected Executive Chairman of the St. Jude Medical 
      Board of Directors.
    


      “St. Jude Medical is moving forward with this leadership succession from 
      a position of strength and, because of this, we believe it’s the right 
      time to make this transition,” Starks said. “Our consistent ability to 
      deliver impactful technologies that improve patient outcomes is what 
      ultimately drives sales and creates shareholder value. The progress we 
      have made with our innovation-based growth program is becoming 
      increasingly visible. We have demonstrated our ability to accelerate 
      sales driven by our key growth driver programs, including CardioMEMS, 
      our atrial fibrillation portfolio and our robust pipeline of 
      neuromodulation products for chronic pain.”
    

      “St. Jude Medical’s mission is to transform the treatment of expensive 
      epidemic diseases where medical device technology can improve patient 
      care and reduce the costs of health care,” continued Starks. “Mike’s 
      vision, expertise and proven track record at St. Jude Medical make him a 
      natural choice for CEO. Today's announcement underscores our deep bench 
      of talent and, together, we will ensure a seamless transition for the 
      benefit of all St. Jude Medical stakeholders.”
    

      John W. Brown, St. Jude Medical Director and Chairperson of the 
      Governance and Nominating Committee, said, “As an organization highly 
      focused on talent development, the selection of Mike to succeed Dan 
      reflects the Board’s thoughtful approach to succession planning. Mike 
      has consistently demonstrated that he is a visionary leader, innovator 
      and strong operator, and the Board believes Mike is the right leader to 
      deliver continued shareholder value. The creation of the Executive 
      Chairman role will help ensure a seamless leadership transition.”
    

      Mr. Rousseau joined St. Jude Medical in 1999 as Senior Vice President, 
      Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) Global Marketing, and later that year, 
      CRM marketing and sales were combined under his leadership. In January 
      2008, he was promoted to Group President and assumed responsibility for 
      the company’s four product divisions. He was named Chief Operating 
      Officer in 2014, overseeing global sales, marketing, technology 
      development, operations, supply chain and quality functions. Mr. 
      Rousseau has helped to drive strategic transformation across virtually 
      every area of the company. He was the architect of St. Jude Medical’s 
      recent, significant integration of four product divisions into 
      centralized global functions with a shared global vision, mission and 
      growth strategy based on accelerating innovation. During this time and 
      under Mr. Rousseau’s leadership, St. Jude Medical has achieved 
      significant cost-savings and operational efficiencies. He led the 
      realignment of global supply chain management, restructured the 
      company’s overseas manufacturing, and established a global quality 
      system to put a global infrastructure in place to prepare the company 
      for future growth. Recognizing the changing customer landscape, he 
      broadened the company’s global customer service operations with a focus 
      to enhance the experience for St. Jude Medical customers worldwide.
    

      “Over the past 16 years, I have had the privilege of working alongside 
      Dan to change the company from being largely dependent on valves and CRM 
      devices to being an industry leader with a diverse disease state 
      management portfolio. With our recent acquisitions and our strong, 
      robust product pipeline, I am focused on remaining steadfast in our 
      commitment to innovation and growth so that we can continue Dan’s legacy 
      of bringing the right solutions at the right time to our customers, 
      while improving patient outcomes and reducing health care costs,” said 
      Rousseau. “This is an exciting time for our industry, and I am highly 
      confident in our ability to continue to deliver technologies that 
      transform patient care in markets around the world. I am honored to 
      assume this leadership role in January and look forward to the 
      opportunity to continue shaping the great legacy of St. Jude Medical.”
    

      Stuart M. Essig, Ph.D., St. Jude Medical Director, Chairperson of the 
      Compensation Committee, and Member of the Governance and Nominating 
      Committee said, “Over the last 16 years, I’ve watched Mike execute his 
      vision at St. Jude Medical, and I am convinced he is the right leader 
      for the company today. The Board is very confident St. Jude Medical has 
      the leadership to drive success for many years to come.”
    

      Mr. Starks became Chairman, President and CEO of St. Jude Medical in May 
      2004. During his 11-year tenure, Mr. Starks led the company’s growth 
      from approximately $1.9 billion in annual revenue in 2003 to more than 
      $5.6 billion in annual revenue in 2014, translating into over 20,000 
      patients worldwide who are helped by a St. Jude Medical device each 
      business day. Mr. Starks has been consistently focused on delivering 
      value to shareholders, having delivered approximately 110 percent return 
      to shareholders through share price appreciation and the institution of 
      an annual dividend beginning in 2011. As Executive Chairman, Mr. Starks 
      will assist in strategic customer, business and key stakeholder 
      relationships globally and act as a strategic advisor to Mr. Rousseau in 
      addition to his governance and oversight responsibilities.
    

      “Dan is an exceptional leader who transformed St. Jude Medical into the 
      strong global company it is today, while delivering consistent growth 
      and significant shareholder value,” added Stuart M. Essig, Ph.D. “We 
      look forward to Dan’s continued leadership in his new capacity as 
      Executive Chairman.”
