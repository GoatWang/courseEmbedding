Senior Vice President

BIOGRAPHY
Sheldon Fox is senior vice president, Integration and Engineering, for Harris Corporation. In this role, he leads the integration of Exelis into Harris following the 2015 acquisition and is responsible for leveraging technology across the enterprise, standardizing engineering processes and optimizing shared services. 
Prior to being named to his current position, Fox was group president of Harris Government Communications Systems (GCS), leading the development, production and integration of advanced communications and information systems for defense, national intelligence and civil agency customers worldwide. Previously, he served as president of GCS’ National Programs business unit, serving the intelligence community. Before that, he was president of the company’s Defense Programs business unit, serving the U.S. Department of Defense.
Fox joined Harris in 1984 and has held positions of increasing responsibility, including vice president and general manager of GCS’ DoD Programs and vice president of Programs for DoD Communication Systems. He has played a key role in successfully achieving financial and business objectives and positioning Harris on many nationally important platforms and programs.
Fox holds both a bachelor and master of science degree in electrical engineering from Georgia Tech and a master’s of business administration as a Morehead Fellow from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is a graduate of the Harris WINGS management development program, the Defense Systems Management College at Fort Belvoir, the Mahler Advanced Management Program and the Harris Leadership Directions program at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business.
In 2008, he was named a Georgia Tech Distinguished Engineering Alumnus and currently serves on the Georgia Tech President’s Advisory Board. He also serves on the boards of Enterprise Florida, Inc. and the Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida.
He is a member of the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), Air Force Association (AFA), Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA), Association of the United States Army (AUSA), Navy League, National Defense Industrial Association (NDIA), Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA), United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation (USGIF) and United States Space Foundation.
Harris Corporation is a leading technology innovator, solving customers’ toughest mission-critical challenges by providing solutions that connect, inform and protect. Harris supports government and commercial customers in more than 100 countries and has approximately $6 billion in annual revenue. The company is organized into three business segments: Communication Systems, Electronic Systems and Space and Intelligence Systems.
