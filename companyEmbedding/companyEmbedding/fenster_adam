									Real Movement Book (Hardcopy)								

 


PRICE: $ 24.99











									Real Movement Ebook								

 


PRICE: $ 9.99











REAL Movement is the first book to define true, integrated human motion, within the context of motor control theory.  Adam Wolf synthesizes his experiences in the movement industry into a digestible introduction to integrated motion while providing assessment and progression strategies.  In this book, Adam dives into understanding the interconnectedness of the body, within a framework where bones move, joints feel or perceive motion, and myofascia reacts to control the movement, all while being governed by the nervous system.
The reader will gain an understanding that the site of the injury typically isn’t the cause of the injury and is often the result of something doing too much because something above or below isn’t doing enough.
In-depth discussion includes:


Qualities of integrated movement
Naming 3-D joint motion
Introduction to motor control theories
Exercise/Movement Glossary




Current research on fascia and its influence movement
Clinical considerations sections with key points highlighted in each section
Additional readings list at the end of each chapter







										IMPROVING FASCIAL HIGHWAY SYSTEMS VIDEO STREAM									

 


PRICE: $ 49.99












Adam Wolf’s REAL Movement Fascial Highways Video, an adjunct to the new book, Real Movement


This video was supplied by the presenter and is not an OTP production.The understanding of fascia has seen many developments in recent years. We now know the body, made up of an integrated system of fascial connections, allows combinations of tissue to lengthen together in order to control forces, while efficiently effectively controlling movement.
In current pain science, it’s now understood that the site of pain isn’t necessarily the cause of the pain—a limitation in one area affects the whole. It’s also recognized that pain produces inhibition; therefore, as we understand the principles of motor control theories, we can prescribe the correct combination of mobility and stability movements on an individual basis to help correct a problematic movement pattern. The body exists in 3D and must control gravity, ground reaction forces, mass, and momentum.
This video lecture and workshop explores fascia from the lens of integrated movement and motor control principles. The hands-on course teaches a principle-based approach to assess and test the relationships between muscles and fascial lines, while learning manual therapy techniques designed to improve overall function.
Additionally, Adam teaches strategies to load specific movements to improve tissue mobility. Using a principle-strategy-application process, in this video, you’ll explore assessment and design solutions for whole body influence.
“Adam Wolf and his REAL Movement is the real deal! He has a marvelous perspective on human motion that will change your view of movement.”
Dr. Perry Nickelston,
DC, NKT, SFMA Founder, Stop Chasing Pain
Adam teaches—


Assessing fascial highways using integrated movement for all patient populations
Mobility issues: manual and self-myofascial release techniques
Structure-specific assessments for motion, mobility and stability
Links in the chain: Why the site of pain isn’t always the cause of the pain
Corrective techniques, design solutions and specific therapeutic exercises for stability limitations


Objectives


Identify anterior, posterior and lateral flexibility fascial highway function and discuss how these relate to movement
Describe the principle-based assessment approach for bio-individuality, global, local and essentials of observation
Examine the effects of specific fascial changes such as injury, myofascial restructuring, altered movement patterns and dysfunction
Understand and discuss principles of motor control and the relationship of pain and inhibition.
Discuss structure-specific integrated assessment techniques to test motion, mobility and stability of the hip, lumbopelvic complex and thoracic spine
Correctly distinguish differences between reactive and traditional anatomy relative to integrated movement
Successfully leave with treatment strategies for each body part or segment


“Anyone who has worked with Adam would initially characterize him as a “healer” and that would not remotely capture his brilliance. Adam is so much more than that; he intuitively understands that no modality, no method, nor procedure can outperform your body’s ability to heal itself. Adam is a facilitator and teacher who guides his patients’ intuitive abilities to heal themselves with a deep understanding between muscles, bones, nerves, tendons and spirit, and this book is a demonstration of that”
Marc Davis, 20-year NBA Referee
This is a three-part video set— a 2-day hands-on workshop, filmed and edited down to 3 hours and 43 minutes.
Video One, 90 minutes

What is optimal function?
If dysfunctional, a combination of movement, nutrition, rest/recovery & behavior are out of balance
Naming the planes of motion, influencing motion
Drivers of body motion, behavior driver vs. biological driver vs. physical driver. A driver is a way to create a reaction.
Defining vectors of motion relative to how to name motion
Transformational zones, and how motion is assessed at transformational zones
Bone position and joint motion are different. A foot that’s collapsed should still go through more collapsion. It’s the difference between motion and position.
Discussion of bones spinning around axis in planes of motion
Front foot in gait is bottom-up motion. Back foot in gait is top-down motion
Continued discussion of naming motion at a joint. Bones move in the same direction and one moves faster or slower, relative to the first transformational zone at the hip and knee
Assessing knee internal rotation at the first transformational zone
Biomechanics of the second transformational zone of hip & pelvis top-down motion
Assessing hip motion at 2nd transformational zone
Discussion of post-surgery knee extension, and influence of soleus length & capsule tightness that limits knee extension during gait
Definition of tensegrity relative to the human body
Discussion of chemical reaction of how tissue binds together, and importance of slide and gliding of tissue
Understanding how a flat foot will influence motion in the back, hip and shoulder, and truing the system
Strategies to assess flexibility highways, plus progressions and regressions

Video Two, 64 minutes

Using fascial highways as a warm-up, static to dynamic
Spectrum of movement adding drivers and working both spectrums within a plane of movement
Back hip in gait mobilization in standing
On table hip & rearfoot assessment assessment
Long axis hip & rearfoot distraction and influence on system—Is there a synchronous dissociation when long axis distracting?
Assessment strategies, specifically tissue assessment
Neurological or physiological tightness
Attempt to find a relationship between upregulated and downregulated tissue
Discussion of motor control principles and how stretching might be inhibiting tissue further and causing more dysfunction
Foot assessment paper card test for intrinsic foot muscles, related to motor control
Ability to map the cortical system to have independency and not interdependency
Discussion on the process that occurs when someone is in pain, the importance of naming it to tame it
Introduction discussion of pain science and not creating sympathetic responses in the system
Pain gate theory
Mobility vs. stability—increase mobility somewhere to stabilize somewhere else
Soft tissue excursion vs. joint excursion vs. balance reach. Is it a soft tissue limitation or soft tissue limitation or motor control limitation?
Discussion of closing angle joint restrictions
Treatment strategies and pain vs. discomfort
Hip shoulder relationships
Hip shoulder complex assessment—is there sequential dissociation
Integrated shoulder complex assessment—is there synchronous dissociation in each plane of motion?
Progressions and regressions
Start in integration, and if you can’t eliminate joints from movement, and if pain resolves, look in eliminated joints for dysfunction
Assessing heads of humerus in joint space

Video Three, 69 minutes

Discussion of table shoulder assessment
Tensegrity principled soft-tissue release for subscap to change motor control relationship with tissue
Motor control, off weight-bearing shoulder assessment
Assessing reciprocal inhibitions in the shoulder complex
Distraction vs. compression
Lumbar facet joint pain

Discussion of thoracic spine biomechanics and motion at first transformational zone
Thoracic spine assessment practice
Speeding up top bone vs. slowing lower bone
Diaphragmatic breathing strategies with metronome
Breathwork involved for creating parasympathetic response
Diaphragm Rocktape application for feedback and to re-educate behavior pattern of not hinging with diaphragm breath
Diaphragm assessment on a table utilizing muscle testing and therapy localization to find area of dysfunction
Foot discussion
Joints have motion and should have motion on either side of neutral
Structure issues relative to having motion but never getting positioned
Creating more ankle motion
Driving fibular motion to not have anterior ankle binding during the second phase of gait
Conclusion

Throughout the workshop, Adam answers questions for the group, so you’ll finish watching with a satisfied feeling that you know what you need to know, and it’s up to you and your practice to make things happen. If you’re a physical therapist or clinician, these are same questions your clients have, and you’ll have a new level of confidence in your answers to their queries.
“Adam Wolf’s course came highly recommended by a respected colleague and I was not disappointed. Adam does a masterful job of synthesizing the latest in progressive functional and motor control assessment, treatment, and exercise prescription, then integrates it into manual-based programming the practitioner will find to be immediately clinically applicable. His course requires thought, attention, and some shifting of paradigms, but my patient outcomes have improved and my practice has grown as a result.”
