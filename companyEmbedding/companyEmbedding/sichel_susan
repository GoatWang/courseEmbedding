He was a former president of the Cleveland Orchestra and of the Cleveland Institute of Music.The Taplin name remains on the Princeton Auditorium and the Met company's cafeteria, which he provided when he noticed that the staff had none. He started the Met's Golden Horseshoe, a society to recognize major donors.His first marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Margaret Eaton Taplin; two daughters and a son from his first marriage, Caroline Ruschell of Lexington, Ky., Jennifer Jerome of West Dummerston, Vt., and David F., of South Strafford, Vt.; three stepdaughters, Jennifer Dickerman of Charlotte, Vt., Martha Kelley of Brattleboro, and Susan Sichel of Marlboro, Vt.; a brother, Thomas, of Denver; a sister, Clara Rankin of Cleveland; 12 grandchildren; and 6 great-grandchildren.Mr. Taplin enjoyed appearing on the Met stage as a supernumerary. He studied the piano at the Marlboro Music School in the 1960's.When Mr. Taplin was Met president, he played at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in 1984. An article by Harold C. Schonberg of The New York Times recalled other presidential pianists, like Truman and Nixon.''The difference is,'' Mr. Schonberg reported, ''that Mr. Taplin plays the piano well. Really well -- well enough to play things like the Elgar or Dvorak piano quintets with professional musicians and hold his own.''He played hot jazz as well, Mr. Schonberg wrote, ''without arousing scorn among the jazz critics.''
