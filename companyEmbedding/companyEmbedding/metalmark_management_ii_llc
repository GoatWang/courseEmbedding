      Platform investing


        Metalmark Capital's information advantage helps us identify unique themes and trends in certain industries — enabling us to anticipate and stay ahead of changes in the market. We capitalize on this through platform investing.

        In a platform investment, we either create a start-up company by meeting with a management team, writing a business plan and putting together capital; or we take an existing company and transform it — growing it organically or otherwise taking it to the next level, often through strategic acquisitions.
      

        Starting a firm de novo requires a different level of commitment, thought process and degree of skill than typical private equity transactions. It involves extensive research, leveraging of our proprietary relationships, a long-term commitment and an ability to be actively involved in the issues that occur when acquiring and transitioning facilities, building workforces and managing development plans. Our success in these investments is evidence of our ability to be a creative force that builds long-term value in our portfolio companies.

        At times, as much as one-third to one-half of our portfolio has been made up of these types of arrangements. These case studies demonstrate our experience:
      

Creating a leading hospital management company
Building a natural gas gathering company
Creating a world-class pharmaceutical manufacturing facility

  Copyright © 2017 Metalmark Capital Holdings LLC. All rights reserved.








                    Our focus on platform investing — building a company from the ground up, or transforming an existing company to take it to the next level — sets us apart in the private equity world.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
