                Fund is said to target investments of less than $100 million
            



KKR & Co. is trying to gather $650 million to $800 million for its first fund dedicated to health care, people with knowledge of the process said.The fund, which will make growth equity investments, will be led by Ali Satvat and Jim Momtazee, said the people, who asked not to be named because the details are private. Satvat, a partner focused on health care, and Momtazee, the asset manager’s head of health care, are based in Menlo Park, California.The fund, which started gathering capital this month, will make investments of less than $100 million, one of the people said. KKR’s larger private equity fund will continue to strike big-ticket deals for health-care companies.




A spokeswoman for New York-based KKR declined to comment on fundraising.

More large buyout firms, such as Carlyle Group LP and Blackstone Group LP, are expanding their platforms by raising smaller, single-strategy vehicles in addition to their multi-billion-dollar flagship funds. KKR started the health-care growth strategy by using money from its own balance sheet in deals -- a process that the firm, led by Henry Kravis and George Roberts, has used in the past to start investing in areas such as real estate and growth technology.KKR earlier this month led a $66 million funding round for AcuFocus Inc., an ophthalmic medical device company, according to a Sept. 9 statement.




The firm has invested or committed more than $200 million in health care growth companies since 2014, including in Spirox, a medical device maker, Signostics, a provider of handheld ultrasound and bladder scanner, and Cohera Medical, a developer of surgical adhesives and sealants, according to the statement. KKR has invested about $4.5 billion in health-care companies since 2004.The firm is also collecting money for its latest private equity pool, called Americas Fund XII, and expects to raise the maximum $12 billion agreed to with investors. With money from KKR and employees, the fund will probably exceed $13 billion, Scott Nuttall, KKR’s head of global capital and asset management, said in July.




KKR, founded by Kravis, Roberts and Jerry Kohlberg in 1976, managed $131 billion as of June 30.

        KKR Creates Medical-Device Platform Ajax as Part of Growth Deals

 The BMR Saga: Built On Talent, Beaten By It 
























 





















(Bloomberg) -- KKR & Co. created a medical-device investing platform called Ajax Health as part of its growth-equity approach to health-care dealmaking.






Ajax, formed by KKR with life-sciences private equity firm Aisling Capital, will fund and help operate emerging medical-device companies, KKR plans to announce Tuesday. Led by industry veteran Duke Rohlen, Ajax is also slated to report a $45 million equity investment in Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics Inc., its first portfolio company.






Along with striking big-ticket health deals through its main private equity fund, New York-based KKR has been building out its health-care holdings with investments in early stage companies. The strategy, originally tested with deals funded through the balance sheet, became formalized in the KKR Health Care Strategic Growth Fund, which is seeking as much as $800 million, people familiar with the matter said in September.






The pool has collected total commitments of $598.6 million, according to a fund SEC filing April 11.






A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment on the fund.






Growth investing has emerged as a way for larger firms to tap into industry networks at earlier stages and expand their contacts while making relatively small investments. KKR, which has also invested in early stage technology firms, sees a lack of funding for growing health-care companies, according to Jim Momtazee, head of the buyout firm’s health-care team in the Americas.






The plan is to bridge the gap between venture capital and late-stage funding.






“In very early stage venture you do have some activity in life sciences, and at maturity you have a well functioning market, but getting from company formation to scale -- that’s where we didn’t see adequate capital sources,” Momtazee said in a phone interview. “Being in nearly the full continuum of health-care investing allows us to build out our intellectual capital in the industry.”






Ajax is the ninth health-related growth investment for KKR. The New York-based firm has committed capital to companies including insomnia-device maker Cereve Inc. and Slayback Pharma LLC, a pharmaceutical research and development company.






KKR’s growth strategy focuses on three main facets of health care: diversified pools of clinical-stage opportunities across biopharmaceuticals, medical devices or diagnostics; products post-FDA approval that need capital for expansion plans; and service-oriented businesses.

                Growth-stage health companies lack adequate funding: Momtazee
            



KKR & Co. created a medical-device investing platform called Ajax Health as part of its growth-equity approach to health-care dealmaking.Ajax, formed by KKR with life-sciences private equity firm Aisling Capital, will fund and help operate emerging medical-device companies, KKR plans to announce Tuesday. Led by industry veteran Duke Rohlen, Ajax is also slated to report a $45 million equity investment in Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics Inc., its first portfolio company.

Along with striking big-ticket health deals through its main private equity fund, New York-based KKR has been building out its health-care holdings with investments in early stage companies. The strategy, originally tested with deals funded through the balance sheet, became formalized in the KKR Health Care Strategic Growth Fund, which is seeking as much as $800 million, people familiar with the matter said in September.




The pool has collected total commitments of $598.6 million, according to a fund SEC filing April 11.A KKR spokeswoman declined to comment on the fund.Growth investing has emerged as a way for larger firms to tap into industry networks at earlier stages and expand their contacts while making relatively small investments. KKR, which has also invested in early stage technology firms, sees a lack of funding for growing health-care companies, according to Jim Momtazee, head of the buyout firm’s health-care team in the Americas.




The plan is to bridge the gap between venture capital and late-stage funding.“In very early stage venture you do have some activity in life sciences, and at maturity you have a well functioning market, but getting from company formation to scale -- that’s where we didn’t see adequate capital sources,” Momtazee said in a phone interview. “Being in nearly the full continuum of health-care investing allows us to build out our intellectual capital in the industry.”




Ajax is the ninth health-related growth investment for KKR. The New York-based firm has committed capital to companies including insomnia-device maker Cereve Inc. and Slayback Pharma LLC, a pharmaceutical research and development company.KKR’s growth strategy focuses on three main facets of health care: diversified pools of clinical-stage opportunities across biopharmaceuticals, medical devices or diagnostics; products post-FDA approval that need capital for expansion plans; and service-oriented businesses.
