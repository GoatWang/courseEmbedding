We've all heard the old adage, "A jack of all trades is a master of none." I believe there is some truth to those words; however, there are some that have been gifted to master more than one thing, do many things at a level of mastery and address many topics and diverse audiences at a level of GREATNESS.
I have to admit, I haven't been gifted to master more than one thing yet, nor do I do many things at a level of mastery yet, however, I do address many topics and diverse audiences at a level of GREATNESS!
Why? Because GREATNESS is my standard of how I prepare for my keynotes, presentations, assemblies, trainings and workshops no matter the size of the audience.
GREATNESS happens through the customization process of gathering information and learning as much as I possibly can about the mission, purpose and vision of your team, school, company and/or organization. Once I do my homework about your world, then I can stand before your group and allow GREATNESS to happen.
GREATNESS is contagious! Can you feel it?
Looking forward to having a conversation about your needs very soon! - Kevin
Kevin Bracy, from a National Society of Leadership and Success speaker to the NSLS host.

Kevin Bracy has been a huge part of our football programs success over the past few years. He is character driven and he shows our players that they can reach Greatness by believing in the team concept and making good decisions at home, in school and in the community.

Casey TaylorHead Football CoachDel Oro High School 






Nothing in life worth having comes without sacrifice. Football is no different. It is a game of mental and physical toughness and coming together to battle adversity. Great triumphs and great rewards require great courage, great determination, and great sacrifice.

Ryan GomesHead Football CoachCosumnes Oaks High School 






Your personal story and presentation style was an overwhelming hit with our Air Force Enlisted audience. Your masterful, energy driven and emotional introspective has provided each attendee with an everlasting memory that will pay dividends in their leadership roles in the future.

L. Mark KLOEPPEL, CMSgt USAFR349 Air Mobility Wing Chiefs Group 






In this tough economy one of the most crucial elements for our realtors to have is the right mindset and attitude when starting the new year off. That’s why we are so honored to have Kevin speak to our agents to get them energized and to make sure their beliefs are in the right place so we can all move forward throughout the year and work towards a profitable business.

Chris HaCEO/Team Leader Keller Williams Realty Elk Grove 






Kevin was knowledgeable, confident, in control of the audience and obviously enthusiastic about his topic; he was interesting and enjoyed talking to the students.

Jerri BellonaCarson City, NVCarson High School 






What an amazing way to begin a new year! Your presentation on “Bringing out the Greatness in you” was very well received by all of the agents in attendance – along with my Account Executives and me!

I have learned so much from your presentation.  I have a new outlook on life, like a blindfold has been fully removed. I know I’ll be confident in everything I do so I no longer have to say what if…or I should have.  Thank you Mr. Bracy, you have left a huge positive impact on my life.

I was so inspired after our conference in Palm Springs, that we expanded our theme beyond our mission. I talk “Dare to Be Great” every day with our soldiers, civilians and families. They all have responded. As of June 16 we are the number one ranked recruiting Battalion nationwide, this after almost a decade of mediocrity, and only two years ago we were 36 out of 38.

Miguel D. HoweLieutenant ColonelSpecial Forces U.S Army 






We are so thankful for your God given talent and expertise as you were able to dramatically re-focus our team of United States Air Force professionals, while emphasizing our core values of “Integrity, Service Before Self and Excellence in all we do.” Your skillful inter-mingling of our mission objectives and vision into your presentation was extremely well received.

L. Mark KLOEPPEL, CMSgt USAFR349 Air Mobility Wing Chiefs Group

Nancy CashPasadena, CaliforniaJohn Marshall Fundamental School 






Thank you so much for your outstanding presentation to the student athletes at the University of Utah. Each year the Student Athlete Mentors organize this beginning of the year event and according to feedback from student athletes; this was the best Student Athlete Conference within the last four years! (Seniors only had the last four years for a comparison.)

Mary BowmanAssociate Athletics DirectorUniversity of Utah

Wow, I’m not sure how to truly express how wonderful I thought you were.  I KNOW you moved some of those kids in there, and they will remember you. 

Michelle VienCase ManagerCASA of El Dorado County 






I can’t begin to explain to you the impact you had on the lives of our distributor employees! You’re not only a professional, but your flexibility to engage and capture our diverse audience on two separate occasions in two totally different and non-traditional settings showed that you were prepared, focused, and passionate about delivering change, motivation and personal growth.

Tracy B. NealGeneral Manager, San Francisco & HawaiiMiller/Coors LLC 






I had several conversations with Kevin before our conference regarding the keynote address. He wanted to know the makeup of the audience as well as their concerns. He had us complete a questionnaire and made follow up calls to make sure he understood our issues. He was very careful to make sure his message “fit” the audience.

Joan AlbersPast PresidentCalifornia Career Education Association 






Mr. Bracy’s story captivated the audience. Teachers came back to report that students said this was the best assembly ever; his personal story emphasized the point of the assembly.

Theresa McCandlessStockton, CaliforniaBear Creek High School

La’Tisha CollinsStudentSt. John’s University 






Kevin’s an awesome guy. He puts some magical words in you. Anything is doable if you believe. We went into halftime and talked to each other. You’re looking up at the scoreboard like ‘wow,’ but once you realize that’s not a lot, we can come back and make that up easily, we just did what we had to do…

Max MaglebyQuarterbackDel Oro High School 






Thank you very much for sharing your amazing story with the students from Mesa Verde High School. Your presentation was outstanding and I would recommend it to any High School principal.

Athletics


Being a former high school baseball standout, a community college player/graduate, division 1 baseball player/team captain/graduate and playing 2 years at the professional level, Bracy has an unlimited reservoir of sports experience to pull from. He has the ability to relate with your student-athlete leaders on many levels.
WINNING ON AND OFF THE FIELD
Kevin Bracy will walk your team through this formula for lifelong success.
Bracy knows from experience that your AWARENESS + your BEHAVIOR + your EFFORT = your SUCCESS. Taking the Character approach of doing the right thing and add that to the GREATNESS of your very best effort in all you do daily, it will lead your student-athletes toward lifelong success on and off their field of play.
FROM GOAL SETTING TO GOAL-GETTING
In this talk, Bracy breaks down his "FAB 5 AREAS OF EVERYDAY FOCUS" to help organize and clarify the personal GOALS of your student-athletes. Your student athletes will learn a technique of Goal-Getting that will help them determine their personal goals define their What, Why, and How. These organization and clarity skills will point them toward the best version of themselves and create the habits necessary for a lifelong journey to GREATNESS.
FAB 5 AREAS OF EVERDAY FOCUS:
At HOME. In their CLASSROOM. On CAMPUS. In their EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. In the COMMUNITY
It is one thing to "talk" about the importance of setting GOALS; everybody is talking about it...but what about understanding the BIG WHY behind setting goals? Once you discover your BIG WHY, shift happens from goal setting to GOAL-GETTING!
You Already POSSESS What it Takes for Success...For Life!

Discipline
Determination
Passion
Self-Motivation
Leadership
Great Work Ethic
Selflessness
Etc...

These are all traits that a student-athlete already POSESSES. In this "Beginning of the End" talk for graduating seniors, Bracy empowers your student-athletes by cementing the fact that they already POSSESS everything they need to be a SUCCESS. You may be at the end of your high school/collegiate athletic career, but you are at the beginning of your next step. Don't worry, you already POSSESS what it takes for SUCCESS no matter your next step!
Do You Need a Plan "B"?
"You need to have a Plan B!" These are words often uttered toward student-athletes when it comes to having a back-up plan to sports.
-Is it true?
-Is it necessary to have a Plan "B"?
-If your plan "A" is professional sports, why does your plan "B" have to be lesser than your plan "A"?
As a former student-athlete that had to make that transition...and having done it successfully, Kevin is going to inspire your student-athletes as they look toward their future. This inspiration will give them hope for the future resulting in a positive, hard-working, focused attitude today.
