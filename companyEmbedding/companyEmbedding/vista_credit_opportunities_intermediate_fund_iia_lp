Our Advantage 





Unparalleled Industry Expertise







                        Our roots lie deep within the enterprise software sector, giving us an edge over the competition with our extensive industry knowledge and access to experienced software operators with deep domain expertise.                    







Investment Flexibility







                        We understand that structures may be fluid throughout the course of a transaction based on changes in the market and financing needs. Additionally, we know that investment strategies can vary across the middle market and broadly syndicated markets. Our ability to invest across the capital structure, in companies of all sizes and end markets, allows us to be nimble and meet the needs of sponsors and companies alike.                    







Quick And Reliable Outcomes







                        We begin every diligence process by leveraging knowledge and research across the broader platform, which allows for an efficient process with minimal disruption to sponsors and management teams. That expertise, combined with our nimble infrastructure, results in quick, consistent, and reliable decision-making — mitigating last minute surprises.                    







Scalability







                        Our investment sizes range from $15MM to $50MM, which we expect to increase over time, providing capacity to upsize in support of acquisitions and general growth.
