Trademark Applications
	Trademark applications, moreso than trademark registrations, show the products and services that are developing and being actively marketed.
	Companies that don't have any trademark applications are more likely to be stable, maintaining their existing business lines.
	Companies that are applying for new trademarks are likely to be investing in R&D and marketing, attempting to expand more rapidly or pivoting to reach strategic markets.
	Trademarks may include brand names, product names, logos and slogans.

Recession Risk
	IncFact analyzed data from the last recession to determine whether Ebth grew or shrank over that period. We also looked at other companies in the industry
	 to compare how recession-proof Ebth is relative to the industry. While a new recession may strike a particular industry, measuring the
	 industry and company's robustness during the last recession estimates its ability to weather future recessions.

	
Market Share of Competition: Ebth vs. Largest Competitors
		A competitive analysis shows these companies are in the same general field as Ebth, even though they may not compete head-to-head. 
		These are the largest companies by revenue. However, they may not have the largest market share in this industry if they have diversified into other business lines. 
		The "Competition" section of a business plan or investment memorandum would start by analyzing the information about these companies.
		Competitive advantage comes from offering better pricing or superior products/service.

Greycroft LLC

                                    Greycroft invests in digital media companies, including both business and consumer-focused ventures. The firm invests between $500,000 and $3 million at inception, increasing on a staged basis to double that amount over time. They invest alone or alongside other firms, and will accept a board seat when appropriate, although this is not a prerequisite when syndicating with others. Companies seeking funding should be past the initial start up and development phase and have reached some level of commercial acceptance, regardless of how small the level of revenues. Graycroft expects management teams to bring significant relevant operating experience to their new ventures. They prefer to invest in companies that have a proprietary position, low capital intensity and a device-agnostic model.

Spark Capital Partners LLC

                                    Spark Capital Partners' investments focus on the conflux of the media, entertainment and technology industries. They seek to invest in early stage start-ups, generally in the first venture round, with emphasis on Internet and mobile investments. The firm may invest as little as $500,000 to partner closely with a founder at the seed stage or as much as $25 million to help an emerging winner establish category leadership. Spark looks at a potential investment through the eyes of the ultimate user it serves. They look for companies who concentrate on the consumer above all else. Spark's investment are not limited to any particular sector, but Spark tends to invest in marketplace, social network, SaaS business, mobile platform, advertising solutions and hardware companies.
