      statements include, but are not limited to, expectations or predictions 
      of future financial or business performance, conditions relating to 
      Westfield and Chicopee, or other effects of the proposed merger on 
      Westfield and Chicopee. Forward- looking statements are typically 
      identified by words such as “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” 
      “target,” “estimate,” “continue,” “positions,” “prospects or 
      “potential,” by future conditional verbs such as “will,” “would,” 
      “should,” “could” or “may,” or by variations of such words or by similar 
      expressions. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous 
      assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. 
      Forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this press

      Westfield and Chicopee with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
      (the “SEC”) and those identified elsewhere in this document, the 
      following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from forward looking statements or historical performance: 
      the ability to obtain regulatory approvals and satisfy other closing 
      conditions to the merger, including approval by shareholders of 
      Westfield and Chicopee; the timing of closing the merger; difficulties 
      and delays in integrating the business or fully realizing cost savings 
      and other benefits; changes in asset quality and credit risk; the 
      inability to sustain revenue and earnings growth; changes in interest 
      rates and capital markets; inflation; customer acceptance of products 
      and services; customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit 
      practices; competitive conditions; economic conditions, including 
      downturns in the local, regional or national economies; the impact, 
      extent and timing of technological changes; changes in accounting
