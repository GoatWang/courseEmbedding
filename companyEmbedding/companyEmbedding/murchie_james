MURCHIE, JAMES, farmer, businessman, jp, militia officer, and politician; b. 16 Aug. 1813 in St Stephen (St Stephen-Milltown), N.B., son of Daniel Murchie and Janet Campbell; m. first 1 Nov. 1836 Mary Ann Grimmer, and they had six sons and five daughters; m. secondly January 1860 Margaret Jane Thorpe, and they had two sons and one daughter; d. 27 May 1900 in Milltown (St Stephen-Milltown).
Shortly before the American revolution, James Murchie’s grandfather Andrew Murchie left Paisley, Scotland, with his wife and sons and settled in the American colonies. Following the revolution they moved to New Brunswick and by 1789 had taken up land in St Stephen Parish. Andrew’s son Daniel married Janet Campbell, another Scottish expatriate, and they had nine children. James, the fourth son, grew up on his father’s farm, attended the common school at Old Ridge, and then went to work with his father, farming in summer and making timber in winter. In 1836 he married Mary Ann Grimmer, the daughter of a St Stephen businessman, and took her to a new farm he had purchased.
For the next 17 years Murchie continued his traditional round of life. A man of modest background with little access to sources of capital, he was forced to make his opportunities in the woods and countryside where he worked. Like most fanner-lumbermen of the period he made some timber on his own wood lot, but the majority of his time was spent cutting logs on crown lands or on the lands of the timber merchants of the St Croix River. In all cases the timber either was cut under contract to merchants or was sold to them.
Murchie realized that power and independence of operation depended on ownership of the timber land. Traditionally, access to timber in New Brunswick was obtained by the lease of substantial tracts of crown land. After the House of Assembly acquired control of the crown lands in 1837, five-year leases were normally granted in return for a payment of ten shillings a square mile and a small stumpage fee for each ton of timber cut. Murchie claimed that he built his initial capital by acquiring leases in the 1840s, beginning with small tracts and gradually expanding to the point where he was leasing several thousand acres of woodland and employing crews to cut there.
Murchie built his fortune slowly. For 17 years he remained a farmer and small lumberman, working in the woods with his crew and selling his logs to sawmill owners in the St Stephen area. By 1853 he had accumulated $20,000, and that year he decided to make the transition to timber merchant. He acquired a sawmill in the Milltown area of St Stephen Parish and opened a general store, through which he participated in the truck trade. In the process he abandoned his farm and moved to Milltown, where he eventually built a fine three-storey wooden mansion to accommodate his growing family.
The community into which the Murchies moved was racked by bitter economic and religious divisions. Several years earlier serious labour disputes had broken out when mill owners insisted that workers extend their daily hours and work seven days a week during the months of production. The workers resisted and the situation became more complicated when the Wesleyan Methodist Church, the dominant tradition in the town, supported them, fearing that Methodist workers were being denied the right to fulfil their religious obligations. In the confrontation that followed the Methodist chapel was burned and most of the mill owners, who had denounced the church as arbitrary and hierarchical, abandoned it and took the lead in organizing a Congregational community in Milltown. It was a congregation of the prosperous, its upkeep being assured by an ad valorem tax assessed on the property of its members. Although the Murchies had been Methodists, in Milltown they became associated with the Congregationalists. The shift was symbolic of Murchie’s changing place in society: the lieutenant governor had just called him to the magistracy of Charlotte County, and he was shortly to become a militia captain.
Between 1857 and 1871 the population of St Stephen Parish increased from 2,868 to 6,515, largely because of the expansion of the wood products industries. Murchie benefited from this prosperity more than anybody else. He expanded his milling operations to three gangmills at Milltown and built another gangmill and a rotary sawmill at Rankins Mills (Benton) on the Saint John River. He bought wharf lots and constructed wharfs and mills on both sides of the St Croix at St Stephen and at Calais, Maine. In 1859 he expanded his operations to shipping by purchasing a vessel. During the next decade he commissioned the construction of several vessels, and the Murchie fleet carried cargoes to Australia, the Canary Islands, and South America. Most important, he continued to obtain timber land, both as a source of supply for his mills and as an investment. His largest significant acquisitions before 1861 were 20,536 acres of crown land. In most of these transactions he worked closely with his brother-in-law “Honest” John McAdam, who was surveyor general of New Brunswick when many of the acquisitions were made. He and McAdam obtained most of these lands through fraud by having some of Murchie’s employees file claims on crown lands. After the employees had been granted the lands, they sold them to McAdam and Murchie. These transactions, and others like them, were discovered in 1861, and following an official inquiry McAdam was dismissed.
In addition to running his firm Murchie moved to the centre of the major corporate activities of the leading timber merchants of the St Croix. The economic life of the region was dominated by a dozen families drawn largely from the extended clans of Todds, Eatons, Porters, McAllisters, Marks, and Chipmans. This group controlled the St Stephen’s Bank, the notes of which provided the principal circulating medium of western New Brunswick and eastern Maine. Murchie served as a director of the bank for more than 20 years. He was a promoter of local railway lines in New Brunswick and Maine, and he served as vice-president of the New Brunswick and Canada Railroad and trustee of the St Croix and Penobscot Railroad. He was also president of the St Croix Lloyds Insurance Company.
As early as 1860 Murchie had increased his capital accumulation of $20,000 to more than $85,000 and was producing lumber products on the Calais side to an annual value of more than $70,000. In 1871 his St Stephen Parish assessment totalled $50,000, a considerable undervaluation. His assets that same year included an axe factory with an annual output worth $25,000, 1,800 tons of sailing vessels, and 500 tons of steam vessels.
During this period Murchie’s family grew and changed as rapidly as did his material fortunes. Mary Ann Murchie died in 1857, a few months after the birth of her thirteenth child. Three years later Murchie married 29-year-old Margaret Jane Thorpe, with whom he had three children. In 1871 the Milltown house contained Murchie, his wife, all eight sons, two daughters-in-law, three daughters, and two Irish women servants.
Murchie prided himself on his ability to cruise, scale, fell, and float timber, and his sons were reared to have the same skills. Each was also trained in some aspect of business, and after an appropriate time each became part of the firm. The four eldest sons eventually joined the company, which became James Murchie and Sons, and three younger sons became commission merchants in St Stephen. Murchie’s daughters made marriages within the St Croix business community, and in the 1880s two married into the powerful Eaton clan, Murchie’s closest rivals for economic influence within the region.
Changes in Murchie’s life continued to occur rapidly after 1871. Margaret Jane died in 1872, and Murchie never remarried. As more of the administration of the firm devolved onto his four eldest sons, he devoted an increasing amount of time to other activities. In 1874 he decided to contest Charlotte County in the provincial election on behalf of the Liberal-Conservative party. The only significant issue in the election was the Common Schools Act, which in 1871 had imposed compulsory, non-sectarian schools supported by assessment on all property holders in the province. The act sparked sharp protests from Roman Catholics and produced a constitutional crisis which was resolved only in 1875 when the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council upheld the constitutionality of the act. Murchie ran as a common schools supporter and won easily.
Murchie’s term in the assembly was uneventful. As a member of the government of George Edwin King* he supported the resolution approving the Privy Council ruling on the Common Schools Act; he favoured the bill incorporating the Orange order; and he rejected the bill permitting religious denominations to establish reformatory schools in each county. He broke with his party to support a resolution that agricultural reports be printed in French for the benefit of Acadian farmers. Murchie’s most notable achievement was to secure passage in 1875 of a bill reducing the tax on unimproved granted lands to half a cent an acre. Since he was one of the largest owners of wild lands in the province, his action was blatantly selfserving, and the effect was to direct the burden of local taxation in rural areas onto the developed lands of small farmers. The controversial bill was passed by only 18 votes to 16. Murchie did not seek re-election in 1878. The reasons for his decision and for his advocacy of the Wildlands Tax Act are not difficult to find. The market for New Brunswick lumber had collapsed in late 1874 and remained severely depressed for the rest of the decade. Of the major lumber firms of the St Croix in 1874, only two, the Murchies’ and the Eatons’, were major producers ten years later.
That crisis, coupled with the decision of Sir John A. Macdonald’s federal government to impose a protective tariff on a variety of manufactured products, persuaded many local business leaders that the economic future of the community and the revival of their personal interests rested in the development of a manufacturing base. In early 1880 a group of lumber merchants began promoting a large cotton mill. With the aid of Rhode Island capitalists they succeeded in forming the St Croix Cotton Manufacturing Company and opening the St Croix mill, the second largest in Canada, in 1881. Murchie was a promoter and a stockholder, and he was later president of the company. His eldest son, John G., served as a director of the mill prior to its consolidation into the Canadian Colored Cotton Mills Company combine in 1892.
Murchie’s involvement with cottons, as with railways, remained secondary to his lumbering concerns. Despite several serious financial set-backs, including the burning of three mills and the loss of several vessels at sea, the Murchie firm survived and even prospered through the 1870s and 1880s. In part this success resulted from its ownership of extensive timber lands. Murchie continued to collect timber land whenever possible, even in the depths of the commercial depression. By 1890 the firm probably owned close to 200,000 acres, about a quarter of it in Maine and the remainder in New Brunswick and Quebec. Its milling activities had expanded into the Saint John valley, where mills had been established at Edmundston and Deer Lake. At Princeton, Maine, orange boxes were manufactured for Florida and Sicily. In 1883 a federal study of industry placed Murchie’s personal investment in St Stephen and Milltown alone at $220,000, second only to the $1,000,000 capital of the cotton manufacturing company. As late as 1891 the firm claimed to have exported more than 25 million feet of long lumber, 30 million laths, and 65 million shingles from Canada that year.
James Murchie died at Milltown in his 87th year, having lived to see his firm the sole remaining major lumber industry on the St Croix. A widower for 28 years, he was survived by seven sons and five daughters. His personal estate consisted of a one-sixth interest in James Murchie and Sons, valued at $144,000. In addition, he owned nearly 11,000 acres of woodland, shares in two mills, and ten town-lots which he had accumulated outside the firm. Perhaps surprisingly, he died intestate.
In many ways James Murchie was a heroic figure, viewed with respect by the men among whom he worked most of his life. Like Alexander Gibson*, who grew up in the same community at about the same time, Murchie was a man of humble origins who spent many years at woods work. “Gifted with an iron constitution, a strong will, and a capacity for work,” he was also a canny and self-interested man of affairs who knew what he wanted and was prepared to use any means to achieve it. He was one of the most successful and persistent members of a class of timber barons that dominated the New Brunswick economy throughout most of the 19th century.

Their name comes from the  personal name Murdo. The Gaelic form of the surname was Mac Mhurchaidh, meaning son of Murdo. The name Murdo is equivalent to Murdock, and means sea warrior.Murchie Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Murchie was first found in south  Uist, in the Outer  Hebrides (Gaelic: Na h-Eileanan Siar), in the present day Council Area of Western Isles, a region controlled by the Norwegians prior to the Treaty of Perth in 1266, where they held a  family seat from early times and their first records appeared on the early census rolls taken by the early Kings of Britain to determine the rate of taxation of their subjects.Murchie Spelling VariationsMurchie Spelling Variations Spelling variations are a very common occurrence in records of early Scottish names. They result from the repeated and inaccurate translations that many names went through in the course of various English occupations of  Scotland. Murchie has been spelled MacMurchie, MacMurchy, MacUrchie, MacWurchie, MacWorthy, MacVurchie, Murchie and many more.Murchie Early HistoryMurchie Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Murchie research.

Many stayed, but some headed west for the endless open country of the prairies. In the American  War of Independence, many Scots who remained loyal to  England re-settled in Canada as United Empire Loyalists. Scots across North America were able to recover much of their lost heritage in the 20th century as  Clan societies and highland games sprang up across North America.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.

Their name comes from the  personal name Murdo. The Gaelic form of the surname was Mac Mhurchaidh, meaning son of Murdo. The name Murdo is equivalent to Murdock, and means sea warrior.Murchie Early OriginsPDF Coat of Arms+ Extended History
    Buy PDF History »The surname Murchie was first found in south  Uist, in the Outer  Hebrides (Gaelic: Na h-Eileanan Siar), in the present day Council Area of Western Isles, a region controlled by the Norwegians prior to the Treaty of Perth in 1266, where they held a  family seat from early times and their first records appeared on the early census rolls taken by the early Kings of Britain to determine the rate of taxation of their subjects.Murchie Spelling VariationsMurchie Spelling Variations Spelling variations are a very common occurrence in records of early Scottish names. They result from the repeated and inaccurate translations that many names went through in the course of various English occupations of  Scotland. Murchie has been spelled MacMurchie, MacMurchy, MacUrchie, MacWurchie, MacWorthy, MacVurchie, Murchie and many more.Murchie Early HistoryMurchie Early HistoryThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Murchie research.

Many stayed, but some headed west for the endless open country of the prairies. In the American  War of Independence, many Scots who remained loyal to  England re-settled in Canada as United Empire Loyalists. Scots across North America were able to recover much of their lost heritage in the 20th century as  Clan societies and highland games sprang up across North America.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.

Colin Murchie
/surnames.murchie/119/mb.ashx
      Colin was born in April 1937 in South Australia. Parents were James and Magdalena (Maggie). James had 3 children from his 1st marriage, James Allan, Annette and I think Alexander in South Africa. He came to Australia and was here in the 1930's and 1940's having joined the army during WW2. I am interested in any connection a member may have to this family. Cheers Di

Colin Murchie

      Hi, I am seeking  information on my brother Colin Murchie.<br>Colin was born on 24/04/1937 in South Australia and adopted by James and Magdalena Murchie (formally Van Aardt). James had 3 children born in South Africa by his 1st wife who died about 1924. The children I believe were Alexander, James Allan and Sheena. Colin died in South Africa in January 2000 and James died in Pretoria in 1957. Colin was 1 of 6 children who were adopted out by his biological mother. All but 1 of these children have died so any information<br>would be greatly appreciated.<br>His birth surname was Snow.<br>Cheers Di

      I know this post is quite old, but thought I'd reply for anyone who happened across it.<br>My name is Jessie Saker Partridge. I'm the granddaughter of Catherine  Murchie and Ernest Saker.<br>Capt. John and Mary Simm Murchie had 7 daughters. Their youngest daughter Flora #7,died at an early age, @ 1915.  My grandmother Cathie, #1, the eldest born 1888, married a Saker and settled in Yonkers, NY.  Margaret (Maggie) #2, married a Collins, had a son named Dan @ 1920, Mary(Molly) #3 married a Webb, had a son John @ 1920 as well and a daughter Janet. They both remained in the UK and have descendants living in London as well as the New Forrest. I personally met John in 2009.<br>Angusina was known to me as Aunt Neenie, #4, came to the States as well as Willamina (Mina) Baird, #5 and Janet (Joy)Thompson, #6 .  Unfortunately Mina died a young woman with two young boys, William and Fred. They were raised in an orphanage. Fred is still living in California.  Cousin Bill sadly passed away.  Joy's descendents include a noted medical professor, Dr. Ian Thompson from University of Texas.  I will contact personally and share more knowledge, Cousin!

I have been trying to contact Sybilann Williams who knows of my great aunt Agnes Murchie and probably hers,who was a foundation member of the the Durban Young Ladies Collegiate Evangelical Institution.  She died at age 100 after she opened the shopping arcade in Durban named Murchie's Passage name for Alexander Murchie who had his grain mill office in the 1870's.

      Greetings, Jan, it's lovely to find another researcher in the Murchie tree. Yes we are closely related. My Mother Olive and your Grandmother Doris were sisters. I've kept in contact with Doris' daughters, Lorne and Allison. Will try to contact you direct through Allison so we can share notes by email. I was named after Lorne, but with my surname of Cawte and my Mum being a tennis player, I'm glad she changed the L to a D before my baptism!<br>Regards, Dorne Cawte<br>Mackay<br><br>

      hello Dorne and Jan, good to hear from you.I have got back to John Murchie and Agnes Mc Clure, however, the trail has dried a little with their marriage.  The name seems to change to Murchy, evidence becomes a little scarce for cross refferencing.  If you have managed to find anything about John or Agnes Mc Clure, I'd be really interested.  I would think with a name like Ivie Mcilwraith Murchie, it's prety safe to say it's the same family.<br><br>

My maternal grandmother Doris (married name Wittkopp) was a Murchie descended from Andrew (her father), then back to Thomas, Ivie McIlwraith, &amp; John. Will be interested to hear from you all.

      Hi Dorne, yes, my thinking about Ivie is the same.  I have looked up the marriage of john and agness in Old Luce, his surname is listed as Murphy.  This has put a big spanner in the works.  Although, Murchie is an equivilant to Murphy, it is rare that the change should happen so late in history (advice from MacDonald archives), have you found any Murchy or Murchie records for John and Agnes anywhere?<br>I will keep posting if I find anything.<br>

      When you look at Hugh's OPR baptism record the writing is terrible. It's hard to read his second name. It could be  McKeddren, McHutcheon or Mccuchion. I haven't found any other instance of Hugh Murchie using his middle name, so I didn't fret over the correct spelling. <br><br>Good luck with your search to get back further to "Jardine's Book of Martyrs". It could be significant that a young Ivie Murchie b.~1805 was given a middle name of McIlwraith. Preserving a link to 1600s history maybe?<br>- Dorne Cawte

      Ruth, it's lovely to find someone else sitting in my tree!<br><br>It was John Murchie and Agnes McClure's grandson Thomas Murchie who sailed to Australia in 1862.  Thomas b.1835 in Barr, was the eldest son of Ivie McIlwraith Murchie (b.1805 North Balloch, Barr)and Jane Wilson (b. Muirkirk). Thomas Murchie b.1835 and wife Elisabeth Wright (m. Ballantrae 1861) became pioneers in the Bundaberg district of Queensland, Australia. <br><br>I think the children of John Murchie and Agnes McClure were John b.1792, Jean 1793, Mary 1796 all b. Challachmun, Old Luce, then (born Barr) Hugh 1798, David 1801, Agnes 1803, Ivie 1805, James 1807, Thomas 1809, Robert and twin William 1812, Wilhelmina 1816.

My personal email is <a href="mailto://jdelli@ncable.net.au">jdelli@ncable.net.au</a><br><br>Cheers!<br>Jane

Re: Murchies of Wigtownshire &amp; Prestwick
/surnames.murchie/111.1/mb.ashx
      My great-grandmother is Elizabeth Murchie, daughter of Charles &amp; Lillias Murchie.  Charles' parents were Edward and Agnes Murchie (nee Reid). Lillias' parents were John &amp; Jane Ramsay (nee Robb).   I am trying to find more information on my great-grandmother Elizabeth - specifically where she died and what year.

      I have a cousin Jessie Sibbald (1905-1994)who emigrated to Winnipeg at age 2 with her parents - Joseph Sibbald and Maggie Murchie Sibbald (b. 1880). Maggie's father was William Hay Murchie b. 1842 in Ayrshire, Scotland - probably Prestwick. Her mother was Elizabeth Jones (b. 1845).

Re: Elizabeth Murchie
/surnames.murchie/110.2/mb.ashx
      I have an Elizabeth Murchie born in Glasgow 1875 (my Great Grandmother's sister).  Parents William Hay Murchie (b. abt 1842) and Elizabeth Jones (b. abt 1845).  Elizabeth Murchie had an Uncle George Mcfadzean Murchie (b.1854)and an aunt named Agnes (b. 1858). Seems like this is probably your Elizabeth.  How the Mcfadzean part enters in is not clear to me. - Emily

Murchies of Wigtownshire &amp; Prestwick
/surnames.murchie/111/mb.ashx
      I recently discovered my Murchie lineage but have very little information.  My great great grandfather was Charles Murchie born in Portpatrick, Wigtownshire between the years 1922-1933 depending on census information.  He married Lillias Ramsay in 1866 and had 2 daughters - Agnes 1866 and Elizabeth 1869 (my great grandmother). I believe Charles's parents was Edward Murchie born c1802 in Ireland and Agnes Reid born c1805 in Stranraer, Wigtownshire.<br><br>Any information would be greatly appreciated.

Re: Murchie's Tea Co.
/surnames.murchie/18.22.67.75.2/mb.ashx
      Sorry, that is incorrect. John Murchie, founder of Murchie's Teas was my gr-grandfather.  He did indeed go to Bathurst, New Brunswick, but was born on the Isle of Arran, Scotland about 1855, to John Murchie &amp; Catherine Nicol. He did not have a sister Margaret - although he did have a granddaughter Margaret, but she married a McKenzie in Vancouver.  John Murchie married Sarah Annie Grant of Bathurst, New Brunswick - her mother, Isabella (nee Raitt) ran a boarding house/hotel in Bathurst after her husband, Abraham Grant, died.

      Dear Bill,<br>Please correct me if I am wrong but, I found a census record<br>from St. Stephan, NB, Canada and found the following information:<br><br>Andrew Murchie son of Andrew Gavin Murchie and Janet Campbell<br>He married twice: 1st wife Nancy Evaline Eastman<br>2nd married: 13 Aug 1834 to Nancy B. Elliot<br>Children:<br>Eveline and Pralina b. 23 Nov 1835<br>John Elliot b. 20 Jan 1838<br>Joanette Campbell b. 11 Aug 1839<br>Frederick Major b. 24 May 1842<br>Josephus More b. 15 Dec. 1843<br>Syvanus Toby b. 4 May 1846<br>Mehitable Ann b. 17 June 1848<br>Henry Andrew b. 27 Aug 1850<br>Albert Theodore b. 20 Jan 1853<br><br>Andrew Gavin Murchie b. 29 Mar 1765 Lower Risby, Renflew, Scotland<br>m. Janet Campbell<br><br>He was the son of William A. Murchie and Agnes Simpson both born in Scotland.<br><br>Some where I also found that Albert Malone co-signed marriage bond of Henery A. Murchie to a Luella M. Hayman. This gave me the thought that Henery Murchie was the brother of Mehitable Murchie as Albert Malone was her husband. <br><br>Any thought would be greatly appreciated.

      Glad to help any way I can. I haven't really been researching a lot, just gathering old clippings and scrapbooks to get it organized. This is a great place to put it together. I'm new to this so bear with me. Are you able to view my family tree? I added some old obituaries I found. Hattie has a nice one as well as her mother Nancy. I'll see what else I can dig up. Hope to hear from you again.  Bill.
