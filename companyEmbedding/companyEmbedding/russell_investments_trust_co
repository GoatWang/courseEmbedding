The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

History[edit]

1936 — Local businessman Frank Russell starts a small brokerage firm in Tacoma, Washington.
1958 — George Russell joins his grandfather's firm, Frank Russell Company. Six months later, George becomes chairman, president and CEO when his grandfather dies. The company has two employees — George and an assistant.
1974 — Russell's institutional consulting business grows from a single client to 40 major U.S. clients, including AT&T and General Motors.
1979 — Russell initiates its global presence with the opening of an office in London.
1980 — Russell launches its investment management business in response to a client's request for funds that provide a fully diversified and packaged blend of investment managers. Russell begins leveraging its research of outside managers[clarification needed] to create a manager-of-managers investment process for smaller retirement plans and individuals.
1984 — Russell researchers create the Russell 1000, Russell 2000, and Russell 3000 Indexes as benchmarks for evaluating manager performance. Russell opens an office in Toronto, Ontario.
1986 — Russell opens an office in Tokyo, Japan and opens an office in Sydney, Australia.
1988 — Russell dedicates a new headquarters building in Tacoma, Wash.
1990 — Mike Phillips is named president of Frank Russell Company. In 1993, he is named chief executive officer. George Russell continues as chairman. George Russell establishes Russell 20-20, a group of independent money managers and plan sponsors who explore emerging markets with an eye toward investment opportunities.
1999 — Russell expands to Singapore. Northwestern Mutual, the largest provider of individual life insurance in the United States, acquires Russell. The company retains the Russell name, management, office locations and investment approach.
2002 — George Russell retires, retaining the role of chairman emeritus for Frank Russell Company and Russell 20-20.
2003 — Russell changes its business name to Russell Investment Group. Craig Ueland is appointed president of Russell in July 2003 and then CEO effective January 2004.
2004 — In March, Russell acquires Pantheon Ventures, the global private equity fund-of-funds specialist headquartered in London. In August, Russell acquires the Australian HR services operation of Towers Perrin.
2007 — Russell's family of U.S. equity indexes goes global with the launch of a family of global stock indexes. Russell opens an office in Seoul, Korea.
2008 — Russell investments announced that they might leave Tacoma, having outgrown their old headquarters. The lease on the headquarters on A Street expires in 2013. Local government officials, wary of losing the biggest company in downtown Tacoma, have started an attractive campaign to keep Russell in Tacoma, including plans for a brand new headquarters.[5][6]




FT reports that Russell Investments is to close two of its three main hedge funds following a sharp drop in assets under management to less than two billion USD. Investors were already gated and redemptions reported to be high. Many staff in the Alternatives Division were laid off, with the few remaining persons employed to oversee the wind-down process of the above.




2009 — ::Russell’s Board of Directors named Andrew Doman as Russell’s new Chief Executive Officer. Andrew Doman assumed role of President upon John Schlifske's return to Northwestern Mutual. :: Russell Investments said they would move headquarters from Tacoma to Chase Center in Seattle.
2010 — Russell Investments completes move of headquarters to Seattle. The former Chase Center building is now renamed Russell Investments Center.
2011 — ::Russell's Board of Directors named Len Brennan as Russell's new Chief Executive Officer. He is also chief executive of the firm's Europe, Middle East, Africa business. ::Russell Investments opens its first regional office in Germany with the launch of Frankfurt operations during October.
2014 — Northwestern Mutual sells Russell Investments to London Stock Exchange Group for $2.7 billion.
2015 — LSEG separates Russell's Index business from the consulting, asset management and consulting business by forming "FTSE Russell" brand[7]
2016 — London Stock Exchange Group completes[8] sale of Russell Investments to TA Associates and Reverence Capital Partners for $1.15 billion. LSEG kept the indexes side of the business as FTSE Russell.
2017 — Willis Towers Watson signs a definitive agreement to acquire its stand-alone Australian actuarial business for an undisclosed sum.[9]

Products and services[edit]
Russell provides financial and investment services to institutional clients such as pension funds, non-profits, healthcare systems and defined contribution plans.[10][10][11] Individual investors can access these services through one of Russell's 580 partners, such as banks, brokers and insurance companies.[12][13]
Russell launched its family of U.S. indexes in 1984 to measure the U.S. market segments. The resulting methodology produced the broad market Russell 3000 Index and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index. The Russell Global Index, introduced in 2007, captures 98% of the global equity market and reflects the performance of more than 10,000 stocks worldwide. As of June 30, 2008, Russell's U.S. indexes have US$4.0 trillion in assets benchmarked to them and account for 63.3 percent of U.S. equity products benchmarked by U.S. institutional investors. Russell/Nomura equity indexes (calculated with Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.) offer broad market or style benchmarks for investors in Japan.[citation needed]
After purchasing all of Russell from NorthWest Mutual in 2014,[14] the London Stock Exchange Group announced on May 18, 2015 the launch of ‘FTSE Russell’, the new integrated name created for the combined businesses of FTSE Group and Russell Indexes. Effectively splitting out the index business from Russell's advice, asset management and investment management offerings, FTSE Russell will now operate as one joint global index business which is no longer owned by Russell Investments or TA Associates.[15]
In North America, Russell delivers target date and target portfolio products directly to Defined Contribution (DC) plan sponsors, as well as distributes LifePoints Funds through financial professionals.

FT reports that Russell Investments is to close two of its three main hedge funds following a sharp drop in assets under management to less than two billion USD.

Products and services[edit]
Russell provides financial and investment services to institutional clients such as pension funds, non-profits, healthcare systems and defined contribution plans.[10][10][11] Individual investors can access these services through one of Russell's 580 partners, such as banks, brokers and insurance companies.[12][13]
Russell launched its family of U.S. indexes in 1984 to measure the U.S. market segments. The resulting methodology produced the broad market Russell 3000 Index and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index. The Russell Global Index, introduced in 2007, captures 98% of the global equity market and reflects the performance of more than 10,000 stocks worldwide. As of June 30, 2008, Russell's U.S. indexes have US$4.0 trillion in assets benchmarked to them and account for 63.3 percent of U.S. equity products benchmarked by U.S. institutional investors. Russell/Nomura equity indexes (calculated with Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.) offer broad market or style benchmarks for investors in Japan.[citation needed]
After purchasing all of Russell from NorthWest Mutual in 2014,[14] the London Stock Exchange Group announced on May 18, 2015 the launch of ‘FTSE Russell’, the new integrated name created for the combined businesses of FTSE Group and Russell Indexes. Effectively splitting out the index business from Russell's advice, asset management and investment management offerings, FTSE Russell will now operate as one joint global index business which is no longer owned by Russell Investments or TA Associates.[15]
In North America, Russell delivers target date and target portfolio products directly to Defined Contribution (DC) plan sponsors, as well as distributes LifePoints Funds through financial professionals.

History[edit]

1936 — Local businessman Frank Russell starts a small brokerage firm in Tacoma, Washington.
1958 — George Russell joins his grandfather's firm, Frank Russell Company. Six months later, George becomes chairman, president and CEO when his grandfather dies. The company has two employees — George and an assistant.
1974 — Russell's institutional consulting business grows from a single client to 40 major U.S. clients, including AT&T and General Motors.
1979 — Russell initiates its global presence with the opening of an office in London.
1980 — Russell launches its investment management business in response to a client's request for funds that provide a fully diversified and packaged blend of investment managers. Russell begins leveraging its research of outside managers[clarification needed] to create a manager-of-managers investment process for smaller retirement plans and individuals.
1984 — Russell researchers create the Russell 1000, Russell 2000, and Russell 3000 Indexes as benchmarks for evaluating manager performance. Russell opens an office in Toronto, Ontario.
1986 — Russell opens an office in Tokyo, Japan and opens an office in Sydney, Australia.
1988 — Russell dedicates a new headquarters building in Tacoma, Wash.
1990 — Mike Phillips is named president of Frank Russell Company. In 1993, he is named chief executive officer. George Russell continues as chairman. George Russell establishes Russell 20-20, a group of independent money managers and plan sponsors who explore emerging markets with an eye toward investment opportunities.
1999 — Russell expands to Singapore. Northwestern Mutual, the largest provider of individual life insurance in the United States, acquires Russell. The company retains the Russell name, management, office locations and investment approach.
2002 — George Russell retires, retaining the role of chairman emeritus for Frank Russell Company and Russell 20-20.
2003 — Russell changes its business name to Russell Investment Group. Craig Ueland is appointed president of Russell in July 2003 and then CEO effective January 2004.
2004 — In March, Russell acquires Pantheon Ventures, the global private equity fund-of-funds specialist headquartered in London. In August, Russell acquires the Australian HR services operation of Towers Perrin.
2007 — Russell's family of U.S. equity indexes goes global with the launch of a family of global stock indexes. Russell opens an office in Seoul, Korea.
2008 — Russell investments announced that they might leave Tacoma, having outgrown their old headquarters. The lease on the headquarters on A Street expires in 2013. Local government officials, wary of losing the biggest company in downtown Tacoma, have started an attractive campaign to keep Russell in Tacoma, including plans for a brand new headquarters.[5][6]




FT reports that Russell Investments is to close two of its three main hedge funds following a sharp drop in assets under management to less than two billion USD. Investors were already gated and redemptions reported to be high. Many staff in the Alternatives Division were laid off, with the few remaining persons employed to oversee the wind-down process of the above.




2009 — ::Russell’s Board of Directors named Andrew Doman as Russell’s new Chief Executive Officer. Andrew Doman assumed role of President upon John Schlifske's return to Northwestern Mutual. :: Russell Investments said they would move headquarters from Tacoma to Chase Center in Seattle.
2010 — Russell Investments completes move of headquarters to Seattle. The former Chase Center building is now renamed Russell Investments Center.
2011 — ::Russell's Board of Directors named Len Brennan as Russell's new Chief Executive Officer. He is also chief executive of the firm's Europe, Middle East, Africa business. ::Russell Investments opens its first regional office in Germany with the launch of Frankfurt operations during October.
2014 — Northwestern Mutual sells Russell Investments to London Stock Exchange Group for $2.7 billion.
2015 — LSEG separates Russell's Index business from the consulting, asset management and consulting business by forming "FTSE Russell" brand[7]
2016 — London Stock Exchange Group completes[8] sale of Russell Investments to TA Associates and Reverence Capital Partners for $1.15 billion. LSEG kept the indexes side of the business as FTSE Russell.
2017 — Willis Towers Watson signs a definitive agreement to acquire its stand-alone Australian actuarial business for an undisclosed sum.[9]

Products and services[edit]
Russell provides financial and investment services to institutional clients such as pension funds, non-profits, healthcare systems and defined contribution plans.[10][10][11] Individual investors can access these services through one of Russell's 580 partners, such as banks, brokers and insurance companies.[12][13]
Russell launched its family of U.S. indexes in 1984 to measure the U.S. market segments. The resulting methodology produced the broad market Russell 3000 Index and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index. The Russell Global Index, introduced in 2007, captures 98% of the global equity market and reflects the performance of more than 10,000 stocks worldwide. As of June 30, 2008, Russell's U.S. indexes have US$4.0 trillion in assets benchmarked to them and account for 63.3 percent of U.S. equity products benchmarked by U.S. institutional investors. Russell/Nomura equity indexes (calculated with Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.) offer broad market or style benchmarks for investors in Japan.[citation needed]
After purchasing all of Russell from NorthWest Mutual in 2014,[14] the London Stock Exchange Group announced on May 18, 2015 the launch of ‘FTSE Russell’, the new integrated name created for the combined businesses of FTSE Group and Russell Indexes. Effectively splitting out the index business from Russell's advice, asset management and investment management offerings, FTSE Russell will now operate as one joint global index business which is no longer owned by Russell Investments or TA Associates.[15]
In North America, Russell delivers target date and target portfolio products directly to Defined Contribution (DC) plan sponsors, as well as distributes LifePoints Funds through financial professionals.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
