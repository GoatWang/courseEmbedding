Tiger Seed Auerbach’s Hound Partners Launches New Funds


					January 21, 2014

Hound Partners





					The firm has debuted a concentrated fund and its anticipated long-only fund. 
				



Jonathan Auerbach’s Hound Partners has launched
    two new hedge funds in the new year.
The New York–based hedge fund firm has raised about
    $130 million for Hound Partners Concentrated Fund and an
    offshore equivalent. It also raised about $95 million for Hound
    Partners Long Fund and an offshore counterpart. Hound disclosed
    the launches in separate regulatory filings.
Hound is the latest Tiger Management ancestor to create a
    long only fund for investors in the past year alone. Auerbach
    is what is known as a Tiger Seed, because he received start-up
    investment capital from Tiger Management founder Julian
    Robertson, Jr. Auerbach cofounded his firm with Scott McLellan
    in 2004 while working at Tiger Management. (In 2007, McLellan
    left to launch Marble Arch Partners with Tiger alum Timothy
    Jenkins.) Auerbach previously served as a senior analyst at
    Ziff Brothers Investments before joining Tiger Management.
The long-only fund is no surprise to Alpha readers.
    We reported last July that Auerbach was
    considering launching one.
In a letter dated July 18, Auerbach said such a vehicle had
    been "under strong consideration" for a year and a half after
    he was inspired by a "very positive commentary of another Tiger
    Cub who Julian [Robertson] had over for lunch," we reported at
    the time.
Auerbach did not name the Cub. He also said a few investors
    had been asking for a long-only product. "We are actively
    debating the pros and cons of offering such a vehicle and would
    love your feedback," Auerbach urged investors.
Last year Tiger Global Management, founded by Tiger Cub
    Charles (Chase) Coleman, raised about $1.1 billion for its new
    long-only equity fund, called Tiger Global Long Opportunities,
    and its offshore version, according to a regulatory filing. The
    funds were launched on October 1 with a minimum investment of
    $1 million. We had reported earlier in the year that the New
    York-based hedge fund firm was mulling a long-only fund.
    Coleman runs Tiger Global’s hedge funds with
    partner Feroz Dewan, who oversees them on a day-to-day
    basis.
Earlier in the year, Philippe Laffont’s New
    York–based hedge fund firm Coatue Management began
    raising money for the Coatue Long Only Partners fund. Other
    Tiger Cubs who manage successful long-only funds include
    Stephen Mandel Jr. of Lone Pine Capital, O. Andreas Halvorsen
    of Viking Global Investors and Lee Ainslie of Maverick
    Capital.
In 2013 Hound Partners, Auerbauch’s long-short
    fund, finished the year up 16 percent. In a November letter
    obtained by Alpha, the hedge fund, which was up 17.23
    percent through the first 11 months of the year, pointed out
    that its long portfolio had gained 38.75 percent before
    accounting for fees. The short portfolio had lost 14.43 through
    November. At the time, Hound was 96 percent long and 65 percent
    short.

Hound Partners, Marble Arch Partners Returns, Letters
































































 


















Hound Partners And Marble Arch Partners Resource Page




Jonathan Auerbach and Scott McLellan were the joint founders of long/short equity fund Hound Partners. The fund was founded during 2004, and, as is the case with many Tiger Funds, was started with seed capital from Tiger Management.
Jonathan Auerbach previously worked at Ziff Brothers Investments and then Tiger Management where he was put in charge of a new fund that would ultimately become Hound Partners.
Scott McLellan was brought in by Jonathan Auerbach to help him run Hound Partners shortly after inception. Prior to that, McLellan worked at Highbridge Capital. During 2007, Scott McLellan left to form Marble Arch Partners with Timothy Jenkins. Jenkins is another Tiger alumni.
Jonathan Auerbach: Hound Partners

 
Like almost all of the Tiger Cub funds, and those funds started with seed capital from Julian Robertson, Hound Partners uses a long/short fundamental equity strategy. Hound was provided with seed capital from Julian Robertson. The fund currently manages around $3 billion. Like most Tiger seeds, Hound’s headquarters are located in Tiger Management’s offices on the 47th and 48th floors of 101 Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan.
Hound doesn’t pay much attention to macro implications, using a bottom-up approach to picking stocks. Also, Hound tends to run a highly concentrated portfolio of stocks and management have, in the past, made heavy use of derivatives to express the fund’s investment viewpoint. Hound’s top positions can account for more than 10% of the total portfolio with many positions going unreported because they trade otc or other illiquid markets. Due to its concentrated basket of stocks, Hound is a good fund for tracking purposes as you know they have conviction in their plays.
Hound has always been a fan of what are known as LEAPS options. Long Term Equity AnticiPation Securities, their technical name, are options on stocks and indexes that go out two years or longer.
An example of a Hound trade: For full-year 2011 Hound returned 18.97%, net of fees and expenses. The long side of the portfolio contributed 5.58% while the short side picked up 17.73%. Around one-third of total profits came from a massive short bet on the global solar sector.

Scott McLellan: Marble Arch
Like Hound, Marble Arch runs a highly concentrated, long/short equity focused portfolio. At the end of 2014 the fund had 22 long positions and was looking to reduce the size of the portfolio further in the near future. 20 positions is the target. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the fund’s top ten longs averaged 63% of capital. Marble Arch targets a gross exposure of 150%.
Marble Arch favors stocks that are trading at an attractive valuation have a strong competitive advantage and are driving change through reorganization, cost cutting, and acquisitions. In the fund’s own words, cash is deployed into situations that have: “inefficiency-inducing special situation characteristics and opportunities for self-help or accretive capital deployment”. Marble Arch and Hound have shown a lot of similarity in their stock picking over the years.
