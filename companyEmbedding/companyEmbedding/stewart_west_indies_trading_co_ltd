Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).

                          Stock prices used are the "total returns" stock price and will include
                          dividends, spinoffs, splits, and other adjustments.  Because of this, stock
                          prices shown here will likely not
                          match a stock's actual closing stock price on the same date.

(“BTF”), The Denali Fund Inc. (“DNY”), First Opportunity Fund, Inc. (“FOFI”) and Boulder Growth & Income Fund, Inc. (“BIF” and, together with BTF, DNY and FOFI, the “Funds”), have approved the reorganization of each of BTF, DNY and FOFI (the “Target Funds”) into BIF, with BIF continuing as the surviving fund (each, a “Reorganization” and collectively, the “Reorganizations”). The Reorganizations are contingent upon stockholder approval of each Reorganization and other conditions and contemplate, among other things, the following actions:   The assets of the Target Funds will be transferred to, and the liabilities of the Target Funds will be assumed by, BIF in exchange for shares of common stock of BIF (the “BIF Shares”). The BIF Shares will then be distributed to the respective Target Fund stockholders. The net asset value (not market value) of the BIF Shares received by the Target Fund stockholders in the Reorganization will equal the aggregate net asset value (not market value) of the respective Target Fund shares held by such stockholders as of the valuation date.    Certain other actions contemplated by the Reorganizations have been approved by the applicable Boards, subject to stockholder approval. Of these other actions, the following are conditions for the completion of the Reorganizations:   An amendment to FOFI’s Articles of Amendment and Restatement eliminating the right of stockholders to demand the fair value of their shares upon reorganization with another registered investment company in a family of investment companies having the same investment adviser or administrator as FOFI (the “FOFI Amendment”); and   The elimination of BIF’s fundamental investment policy limiting the ability to invest more than 4% of total assets in any single issuer (the “4% Policy Change”).    The applicable Boards also approved the following actions, subject to stockholder approval, which are not conditions for completion of the Reorganizations:   Upon effectiveness of the Reorganizations, BIF will adopt new investment advisory agreements. The new agreements will provide for a reduction in the current advisory fee (1.25% with a temporary fee waiver of 0.10%) to a new fee of 1.10% on assets under management up to $1 billion, 1.05% for assets between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, 1.00% for assets between $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion and 0.95% for assets exceeding $2.0 billion (the “Advisory Agreements”); and   Upon effectiveness of the Reorganizations, BIF will adopt a new fundamental investment policy for BIF such that it may not invest more than 10% of its net assets in “private funds” (e.g. hedge funds) (the “Hedge Fund Policy Change” and, together with the 4% Policy Change, the “Policy Changes”).    The Boards also determined that if the FOFI Amendment is not approved by FOFI stockholders, the Reorganizations, Advisory Agreements and Policy Changes will not be considered or voted upon by the respective stockholders.
