Expanded Product Portfolio Offers Wide Array of Fitness Solutions:

Bowflex Body™ Line: Unprecedented Nutrition and Energy

Based on advanced science and proprietary formulas, the Bowflex Body™ product line will help activate metabolism, support the immune system, build muscle, burn calories, provide energy and refuel the body. Created by renowned nutritional chemists, the Bowflex Body™ shake can be used as a pre- or post-workout energy booster, as well as a meal replacement with all the necessary nutrition.
The Bowflex Body™ product line includes a French Vanilla-flavored Fitness Shake that contains premium proteins, beneficial fibers, essential nutrients and powerful antioxidants, while other flavors add further benefits such as weight loss or general wellness.

Rich Chocolate Fat Burner+ Shake Boost: Enhanced fat burning power and metabolism boost to aid in weight loss

      “Over the last year, we’ve seen increasing demand for our Nautilus, Inc. 
      brands. We’ve partnered with distributors on a country-by-country basis

Bowflex Max Trainer M7


      Designed to meet an overwhelming response to Nautilus, Inc.'s popular 
      Bowflex Max Trainer product line, this premium machine combines the 
      movements of an elliptical and stair stepper with all-new 
      performance-targeted programming to create a one-of-a-kind cardio 
      workout.
    

      Key features of the Bowflex Max Trainer M7 include:
    


Low-Impact, High Burn: The Bowflex Max Trainer machine's 
        low-impact, high-performance motion maximizes each workout by burning 
        up to 2.5 times the calories of a traditional cardio machine.
      

Fast and Effective: The 14-minute interval workout uses 
        the latest science to make every minute count, delivering a workout 
        that engages up to 80 percent more upper-body muscle, resulting in a 
        full-body workout that doesn't require spending hours at the gym.
      

Enhanced Features, Innovative Workouts: Users can set, 
        track, and monitor progress with the free Max Trainer app, available 
        for both iOS and Android. Equipped with enhanced Bluetooth® 
        connectivity, it is easier than ever to sync workout results with a 
        mobile device and other popular apps, such as Apple Health, Google 
        Fit, MyFitnessPal and UA Record.
      

Built-in Total Body Trainer: Supported by the Smart Max™ 
        feature, the machine learns and adapts to each user's fitness level 
        and goals over time, setting new targets to coach them with 
        performance-targeted programming.
      

Get Motivated: Comes equipped with 11 
        pre-programmed workouts and 20 levels of computer-controlled 
        resistance, plus new interval and performance training modes. In 
        addition, customize any session with the "add time" 
        feature to extend workouts with the push of a button.
      

Upgraded Design: Featuring an enhanced dual mode LCD 
        display, sculpted dipped handlebars, and stainless steel, 
        performance-grade racing pedals to support even the most intense 
        workouts.

Nautilus 628 Performance Series

      includes a treadmill as well as an elliptical, recumbent bike and 
      upright bike featuring EMS optimized drive trains and watts readouts:
    


Nautilus® T628 Treadmill: The Nautilus T628 treadmill offers 
        Bluetooth connectivity and compatibility with the popular RunSocial 
        app that allows users to run the world without ever leaving their 
        treadmill. With 26 built-in Nautilus Training programs, the T628 
        features an exclusive Rebound™ Deck cushioning system that not only 
        softens landing at the front of the deck, it also propels kick-off at 
        the back of the stride to minimize impact while energizing the 
        workout. With a powerful, but quiet 3.5 CHP motor and easy folding 
        SoftDrop™ capabilities, the Nautilus T628 Treadmill offers users a 
        performance-driven, at-home workout solution. The Nautilus T628 
        Treadmill also helps users meet their training goals and measure 
        fitness improvements with the Pacer, Compare and Fitness Score 
        functions built in to push runners to their fullest potential.
      

Nautilus® E628 Elliptical: The Nautilus E628 elliptical 
        features an exclusive Suspension Adjust™ performance cushioning 
        system, which tailors the angle of the footplate at zero or 10 degrees 
        with three options to engage muscle variation while offering 
        cushioning to minimize fatigue to push the user to go longer. Dual 
        slide rails effectively distribute the load of each stride to ensure a 
        smooth, natural motion. The E628 Elliptical offers 29 built-in 
        Nautilus Training programs and is designed with adjustable, 
        multi-position handlebars that feature integrated incline and 
        resistance buttons to easily ramp workouts up or down. This unit is 
        also RunSocial compatible.
      

Nautilus® U628 Upright Bike: The Nautilus U628 upright bike 
        offers 29 built-in Nautilus Training programs and a low-impact cardio 
        solution in a compact design, making it ideal for at-home workouts. 
        With an adjustable SightLine™ console, multi-position handlebars and a 
        fully-adjustable Nautilus Gel™ seat, this bike allows users to 
        personalize their machine for optimal comfort during cycling sessions.
      

Nautilus® R628 Recumbent Bike: The Nautilus R628 recumbent bike 
        features 29 built-in Nautilus Training programs, an adjustable 
        SightLine™ console, convenient walk through frame and a 30-pound 
        effective flywheel system engineered for a smooth performance and 
        challenging resistance. In addition, the dynamic recline Nautilus Gel™ 
        seat allows users infinite adjustability for back support while 
        cushioning the glutes for a comfortable, low-impact workout.
      


      The Nautilus Performance Series will be available for purchase

Schwinn 30 and 70 Series


      Schwinn is known for its groundbreaking and affordable cardio solutions 
      and the new 30 and 70 Series provide a range of price point options for 
      consumers.
    

      The 70 Series is the top-of-the line Schwinn cardio offering, and 
      includes a treadmill, elliptical and recumbent bike. Most notably, the 
      70 Series features the addition of Bluetooth® connectivity, with

Schwinn 570E Elliptical: The Schwinn 570E elliptical has 
        ergonomically positioned handlebars that provide the option to engage 
        your upper body with the moving handlebars, or lower the intensity by 
        using the fixed handlebars.
      

Schwinn 570R Recumbent Bike: The new Schwinn 570R recumbent 
        bike features an upgraded seat and pedals, and ergonomically

      percent smaller, more streamlined console and refreshed graphics.
    

      The Schwinn 30 and 70 Series will be available for purchase in 
      August 2017 in Australia, Austria, Germany, India, Switzerland, U.K. and 
      New Zealand.
    

Modern Movement


      The groundbreaking Modern Movement product line not only strengthens the 
      core, but also lets users turn their workouts into a live gaming 
      experience, measure improvement in balance and agility, or utilize a 
      digital trainer with the revolutionary M-Trac™ app. Balance and 
      instability training both contribute to amping up workouts to reach a 
      higher level of achievement for exercisers of all levels, from elite 
      athletes to fitness newcomers. The Modern Movement Product Line includes 
      the new M-Pad™ Balance Trainer, Edge-Board™ Extension Trainer and 
      M-Straps™ Bodyweight Trainer.
    


M-Pad Balance Trainer: Instead of only moving from 
        front-to-back or side-to-side, the M-Pad balance trainer uses a wider 
        range of motion to better replicate real life movements. This 
        combination of instability and motion provides a better method for 
        improving balance while actively engaging and strengthening core 
        muscles. The M-Pad balance trainer is designed for beginner and 
        intermediate training and comes complete with adjustable footpads, 
        allowing users to customize their workouts. The M-Pad balance trainer 
        has a low two-inch step-on height, enabling even those who have never 
        used a balance trainer to build confidence quickly. The three, 
        attachable rubber base pads increase the level of difficulty with each 
        additional pad, allowing the M-Pad balance trainer to progress with 
        users as their balance skills improve. The M-Pad balance trainer 
        integrates with the M-Trac app, which leverages the sensors in a 
        smartphone to measure balance ability and track improvement. Trainers, 
        coaches and physical therapists will find the app helpful in measuring 
        their clients’ progress.
      

Edge-Board Extension Trainer: The Edge-Board extension trainer 
        is far more than just a tool to build rock solid abs, as the user can 
        place either their hands or feet on the deck to initiate exercises. 
        The Edge-Board extension trainer features a low deck height for more 
        natural lunge movements and can integrate arcing turns into various 
        movements to engage a broader range of muscles. The rocking deck 
        creates instability, which boosts the challenge to core and 
        stabilizing muscles. The braking feature helps beginners start with 
        shorter movements, gradually increasing the length and difficulty of 
        movement as they gain strength and confidence. Integrated into the 
        deck are two, rubber foot pads, making it easy for the user to quickly 
        position their feet for exercises such as Atomic Push-ups. The 
        Edge-Board extension trainer integrates with the M-Trac app, which 
        serves as a digital trainer. The app allows users to format their 
        workout by selecting the difficulty, length of workout, and the parts 
        of the body they want to focus on; it will then guide them through a 
        customized video workout. The M-Trac app also tracks workout history 
        by recording the number of reps, and range of motion for reference 
        during future workouts.
      

M-Straps Bodyweight Trainer: The M-Straps bodyweight trainer 
        uses gravity and the user’s body weight to build strength for a 
        full-body workout. Its patent-pending features improve ease of use, 
        and ease of adjustment over other bodyweight trainers. Printed numbers 
        on the straps make it easy to quickly adjust and ensures the two 
        handles are both set at the same height. Positioning the length 
        adjustment buckle above head height keeps the numbered adjustments 
        easy to see, as well as allowing for faster adjustments between 
        exercises. The buckles have been moved away from pressure points on 
        the arm for improved ergonomics. The “split” system has each handle 
        strap attaching separately to a bar or door frame, allowing the user 
        to adjust the width of the anchor points. This allows for a broader 
        range of motion and can engage different muscle groups, making 
        workouts more or less challenging, depending on the user. The anchor 
        buckle located at the end provides a second point for length 
        adjustment, so that the system can support up to a ten-foot ceiling, a 
        door frame, and all ranges of user heights.
      


      The Modern Movement product line will be available for purchase in the 
      third quarter of 2017 in Australia, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, U.K. 
      and New Zealand.

Organization[edit]
Nautilus, Inc. is the maker of home fitness equipment brands Bowflex, Nautilus, Schwinn Fitness and Universal Gym Equipment, sold directly to customers through a combination of television commercials, infomercials, response mailings, the Internet and inbound/outbound call centers. Select Bowflex home gyms and Schwinn cardio equipment are also available in retail stores.[6]
In 2015, the company opened a new building across from its headquarters in Vancouver, Washington, United States to expand its development and research team.[6]
Brian Cook, held the CEO position for 17 years, from to 1986 to 2003 when he was replaced by Gregg Hammann.[7][8] who resigned in August 2007 after sales fell to $134 million from $159.6 million in 2006.[9]
In 2007, after Hammann’s departure, Robert S. Falcone, the former Nike chief financial officer, became the Nautilus, Inc. interim chief executive officer,[10] where he also served as president and chairman since October 17, 2007.[11] In April 2008, Falcone was replaced by Edward Bramson, a major stock owner.[12] Under Bramson’s leadership, the company changed sales focus to solely direct-to-customer and retail businesses, which resulted in the sale of its StairMaster brand.[12] Bramson was CEO and chairman of Nautilus, Inc. until May 2011, when he announced he would be stepping down and Bruce M. Cazenave, former executive with Black and Decker and Timberland, would be the new CEO.[12]
Bruce M. Cazenave is the current CEO of Nautilus, Inc. and since he’s taken over in 2011, his plan has been to release better and more cost-effective retail products.[6]
History[edit]
The current corporate flavor of Nautilus, Inc. originated in 1986 with the sale of most of the company by the inventor of the Nautilus machine, Arthur Jones.[13] Jones created the Nautilus machine, then called the Blue Monster, in the late 1960s, with the purpose of creating a fitness machine that accommodates human movement.[13] The company's name was changed to Nautilus because the logarithmic-spiral cam, which made the machine a success, resembled a nautilus.[13] On August 28, 2007, Jones died from natural causes at his home in Ocala, Florida, at the age of 80.[13]
Bowflex acquired Nautilus, Inc. and specialized in designing, developing and marketing strength and cardio fitness products.[6] In 1997, the company changed its name to Direct Focus and acquired Nautilus, Schwinn and StairMaster between 1999 and 2002, before changing its name to Nautilus, Inc.[6] Nautilus became a publicly traded company in May 1999.[14]
The company stopped selling exercise equipment to gyms in 2011 and shifted its focus to home-use equipment. The same year, Nautilus, Inc. licensed its brand name and technology to other manufacturers.[6]
In June 2014, Nautilus, Inc. was sued by Biosig Instruments for allegedly infringing its heart-rate monitor's design for its Bowflex Boost activity tracker.[15] The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Nautilus, Inc. because the Biosig Instruments patent was not precise enough.[15]
For two years running (2013 & 2014), Nautilus, Inc. was recognized by The Oregonian as one of the top places to work,[16][17] as well as the company with the healthiest employees of Oregon by the Portland Business Journal, in its 101-500 employee category.[18]
The company has been an American Heart Association Fit-Friendly company since 2010, winning for three consecutive years the Platinum Fit-Friendly Workplace award.[19][20] The company is recognized for its Road to Wellness Program, which challenges and rewards Nautilus, Inc. employees to get healthier by just walking.[20]
In June 2013, a number of Nautilus employees participated in the Tough Mudder in Fossil, Oregon. The race is a 10-mile obstacle course which serves as a way to raise money for the Wounded Warrior Project.[21]
Finance[edit]
On March 18, 2014, Bruce Cazenave, CEO of Nautilus, Inc., rang the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell. Nautilus, Inc. also featured its new home fitness cardio machine, Bowflex MAX Trainer, on the NYSE trading floor and discussed the company’s 2013 fourth quarter and full year financial growth.[22]
In 2013, Nautilus, Inc. posted $218.8 million in revenue, a 13% increase over 2012.[6][23] The company’s financial performance in the past two years has led to Nautilus, Inc. landing at No. 4 on The Seattle Times’ 23rd annual ranking of publicly traded companies based in the Northwest.[6]
Since 2012, the company’s stock has increased to more than $11 a share.[6]
During the Great Recession, between 2007 and 2010, Nautilus, Inc. saw almost $255 million in losses, with its stock ranging from 45 cents to $4, between 2009 and 2012.[6]
Products[edit]
The Bowflex brand includes cardio machines Bowflex MAX Trainer[24] and Bowflex TreadClimber,[14] the SelectTech Adjustable Dumbbells[25] for strength training, and Bowflex Xtreme 2 Home Gym[26] and Bowflex Revolution Home Gym.[27]
The Schwinn brand includes cardio machine products such as the Schwinn AirDyne Bike, designed to challenge users’ entire body by increasing more wind resistance the harder they pedal against the fan.[28] The brand also includes Schwinn Ellipticals[29] and Schwinn Recumbent Bikes.[30]
The Nautilus brand sells through retail the Nautilus E514c Elliptical cardio machine made from tubular steel for strength and durability. The E514c Elliptical also includes a LCD display, which tracks users' progress and heart rate.[31] The brand also includes Nautilus T614 treadmill which comes with 22 workout programs.[32] The new 2014 Nautilus cardio brand machines include multi LCD display with Bluetooth® Smart Technology and sync with MyFitnessPal.[33]
The Universal Gym Equipment brand sells selectorized dumbbells[34]

Organization[edit]
Nautilus, Inc. is the maker of home fitness equipment brands Bowflex, Nautilus, Schwinn Fitness and Universal Gym Equipment, sold directly to customers through a combination of television commercials, infomercials, response mailings, the Internet and inbound/outbound call centers. Select Bowflex home gyms and Schwinn cardio equipment are also available in retail stores.[6]
In 2015, the company opened a new building across from its headquarters in Vancouver, Washington, United States to expand its development and research team.[6]
Brian Cook, held the CEO position for 17 years, from to 1986 to 2003 when he was replaced by Gregg Hammann.[7][8] who resigned in August 2007 after sales fell to $134 million from $159.6 million in 2006.[9]
In 2007, after Hammann’s departure, Robert S. Falcone, the former Nike chief financial officer, became the Nautilus, Inc. interim chief executive officer,[10] where he also served as president and chairman since October 17, 2007.[11] In April 2008, Falcone was replaced by Edward Bramson, a major stock owner.[12] Under Bramson’s leadership, the company changed sales focus to solely direct-to-customer and retail businesses, which resulted in the sale of its StairMaster brand.[12] Bramson was CEO and chairman of Nautilus, Inc. until May 2011, when he announced he would be stepping down and Bruce M. Cazenave, former executive with Black and Decker and Timberland, would be the new CEO.[12]
Bruce M. Cazenave is the current CEO of Nautilus, Inc. and since he’s taken over in 2011, his plan has been to release better and more cost-effective retail products.[6]
History[edit]
The current corporate flavor of Nautilus, Inc. originated in 1986 with the sale of most of the company by the inventor of the Nautilus machine, Arthur Jones.[13] Jones created the Nautilus machine, then called the Blue Monster, in the late 1960s, with the purpose of creating a fitness machine that accommodates human movement.[13] The company's name was changed to Nautilus because the logarithmic-spiral cam, which made the machine a success, resembled a nautilus.[13] On August 28, 2007, Jones died from natural causes at his home in Ocala, Florida, at the age of 80.[13]
Bowflex acquired Nautilus, Inc. and specialized in designing, developing and marketing strength and cardio fitness products.[6] In 1997, the company changed its name to Direct Focus and acquired Nautilus, Schwinn and StairMaster between 1999 and 2002, before changing its name to Nautilus, Inc.[6] Nautilus became a publicly traded company in May 1999.[14]
The company stopped selling exercise equipment to gyms in 2011 and shifted its focus to home-use equipment. The same year, Nautilus, Inc. licensed its brand name and technology to other manufacturers.[6]
In June 2014, Nautilus, Inc. was sued by Biosig Instruments for allegedly infringing its heart-rate monitor's design for its Bowflex Boost activity tracker.[15] The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Nautilus, Inc. because the Biosig Instruments patent was not precise enough.[15]
For two years running (2013 & 2014), Nautilus, Inc. was recognized by The Oregonian as one of the top places to work,[16][17] as well as the company with the healthiest employees of Oregon by the Portland Business Journal, in its 101-500 employee category.[18]
The company has been an American Heart Association Fit-Friendly company since 2010, winning for three consecutive years the Platinum Fit-Friendly Workplace award.[19][20] The company is recognized for its Road to Wellness Program, which challenges and rewards Nautilus, Inc. employees to get healthier by just walking.[20]
In June 2013, a number of Nautilus employees participated in the Tough Mudder in Fossil, Oregon. The race is a 10-mile obstacle course which serves as a way to raise money for the Wounded Warrior Project.[21]
Finance[edit]
On March 18, 2014, Bruce Cazenave, CEO of Nautilus, Inc., rang the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell. Nautilus, Inc. also featured its new home fitness cardio machine, Bowflex MAX Trainer, on the NYSE trading floor and discussed the company’s 2013 fourth quarter and full year financial growth.[22]
In 2013, Nautilus, Inc. posted $218.8 million in revenue, a 13% increase over 2012.[6][23] The company’s financial performance in the past two years has led to Nautilus, Inc. landing at No. 4 on The Seattle Times’ 23rd annual ranking of publicly traded companies based in the Northwest.[6]
Since 2012, the company’s stock has increased to more than $11 a share.[6]
During the Great Recession, between 2007 and 2010, Nautilus, Inc. saw almost $255 million in losses, with its stock ranging from 45 cents to $4, between 2009 and 2012.[6]
Products[edit]
The Bowflex brand includes cardio machines Bowflex MAX Trainer[24] and Bowflex TreadClimber,[14] the SelectTech Adjustable Dumbbells[25] for strength training, and Bowflex Xtreme 2 Home Gym[26] and Bowflex Revolution Home Gym.[27]
The Schwinn brand includes cardio machine products such as the Schwinn AirDyne Bike, designed to challenge users’ entire body by increasing more wind resistance the harder they pedal against the fan.[28] The brand also includes Schwinn Ellipticals[29] and Schwinn Recumbent Bikes.[30]
The Nautilus brand sells through retail the Nautilus E514c Elliptical cardio machine made from tubular steel for strength and durability. The E514c Elliptical also includes a LCD display, which tracks users' progress and heart rate.[31] The brand also includes Nautilus T614 treadmill which comes with 22 workout programs.[32] The new 2014 Nautilus cardio brand machines include multi LCD display with Bluetooth® Smart Technology and sync with MyFitnessPal.[33]
The Universal Gym Equipment brand sells selectorized dumbbells[34]

Nautilus, Inc. is the maker of home fitness equipment brands Bowflex, Nautilus, Schwinn Fitness and Universal Gym Equipment, sold directly to customers through a combination of television commercials, infomercials, response mailings, the Internet and inbound/outbound call centers. Select Bowflex home gyms and Schwinn cardio equipment are also available in retail stores.[6]
In 2015, the company opened a new building across from its headquarters in Vancouver, Washington, United States to expand its development and research team.[6]
Brian Cook, held the CEO position for 17 years, from to 1986 to 2003 when he was replaced by Gregg Hammann.[7][8] who resigned in August 2007 after sales fell to $134 million from $159.6 million in 2006.[9]
In 2007, after Hammann’s departure, Robert S. Falcone, the former Nike chief financial officer, became the Nautilus, Inc. interim chief executive officer,[10] where he also served as president and chairman since October 17, 2007.[11] In April 2008, Falcone was replaced by Edward Bramson, a major stock owner.[12] Under Bramson’s leadership, the company changed sales focus to solely direct-to-customer and retail businesses, which resulted in the sale of its StairMaster brand.[12] Bramson was CEO and chairman of Nautilus, Inc. until May 2011, when he announced he would be stepping down and Bruce M. Cazenave, former executive with Black and Decker and Timberland, would be the new CEO.[12]
Bruce M. Cazenave is the current CEO of Nautilus, Inc. and since he’s taken over in 2011, his plan has been to release better and more cost-effective retail products.[6]
History[edit]
The current corporate flavor of Nautilus, Inc. originated in 1986 with the sale of most of the company by the inventor of the Nautilus machine, Arthur Jones.[13] Jones created the Nautilus machine, then called the Blue Monster, in the late 1960s, with the purpose of creating a fitness machine that accommodates human movement.[13] The company's name was changed to Nautilus because the logarithmic-spiral cam, which made the machine a success, resembled a nautilus.[13] On August 28, 2007, Jones died from natural causes at his home in Ocala, Florida, at the age of 80.[13]
Bowflex acquired Nautilus, Inc. and specialized in designing, developing and marketing strength and cardio fitness products.[6] In 1997, the company changed its name to Direct Focus and acquired Nautilus, Schwinn and StairMaster between 1999 and 2002, before changing its name to Nautilus, Inc.[6] Nautilus became a publicly traded company in May 1999.[14]
The company stopped selling exercise equipment to gyms in 2011 and shifted its focus to home-use equipment. The same year, Nautilus, Inc. licensed its brand name and technology to other manufacturers.[6]
In June 2014, Nautilus, Inc. was sued by Biosig Instruments for allegedly infringing its heart-rate monitor's design for its Bowflex Boost activity tracker.[15] The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Nautilus, Inc. because the Biosig Instruments patent was not precise enough.[15]
For two years running (2013 & 2014), Nautilus, Inc. was recognized by The Oregonian as one of the top places to work,[16][17] as well as the company with the healthiest employees of Oregon by the Portland Business Journal, in its 101-500 employee category.[18]
The company has been an American Heart Association Fit-Friendly company since 2010, winning for three consecutive years the Platinum Fit-Friendly Workplace award.[19][20] The company is recognized for its Road to Wellness Program, which challenges and rewards Nautilus, Inc. employees to get healthier by just walking.[20]
In June 2013, a number of Nautilus employees participated in the Tough Mudder in Fossil, Oregon. The race is a 10-mile obstacle course which serves as a way to raise money for the Wounded Warrior Project.[21]
Finance[edit]
On March 18, 2014, Bruce Cazenave, CEO of Nautilus, Inc., rang the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell. Nautilus, Inc. also featured its new home fitness cardio machine, Bowflex MAX Trainer, on the NYSE trading floor and discussed the company’s 2013 fourth quarter and full year financial growth.[22]
In 2013, Nautilus, Inc. posted $218.8 million in revenue, a 13% increase over 2012.[6][23] The company’s financial performance in the past two years has led to Nautilus, Inc. landing at No. 4 on The Seattle Times’ 23rd annual ranking of publicly traded companies based in the Northwest.[6]
Since 2012, the company’s stock has increased to more than $11 a share.[6]
During the Great Recession, between 2007 and 2010, Nautilus, Inc. saw almost $255 million in losses, with its stock ranging from 45 cents to $4, between 2009 and 2012.[6]
Products[edit]
The Bowflex brand includes cardio machines Bowflex MAX Trainer[24] and Bowflex TreadClimber,[14] the SelectTech Adjustable Dumbbells[25] for strength training, and Bowflex Xtreme 2 Home Gym[26] and Bowflex Revolution Home Gym.[27]
The Schwinn brand includes cardio machine products such as the Schwinn AirDyne Bike, designed to challenge users’ entire body by increasing more wind resistance the harder they pedal against the fan.[28] The brand also includes Schwinn Ellipticals[29] and Schwinn Recumbent Bikes.[30]
The Nautilus brand sells through retail the Nautilus E514c Elliptical cardio machine made from tubular steel for strength and durability. The E514c Elliptical also includes a LCD display, which tracks users' progress and heart rate.[31] The brand also includes Nautilus T614 treadmill which comes with 22 workout programs.[32] The new 2014 Nautilus cardio brand machines include multi LCD display with Bluetooth® Smart Technology and sync with MyFitnessPal.[33]
The Universal Gym Equipment brand sells selectorized dumbbells[34]

      innovative home fitness equipment, today unveiled new products,

      including the Bowflex Body™ nutrition line, Bowflex® SelectTech® 560

      Dumbbells and a new line of Nautilus® cardio equipment.

    


      "Consumers expect innovative fitness products and solutions from

      Nautilus Inc., and our newest home fitness equipment and nutrition line

      continue this heritage while delivering options that make fitness

      achievable for everyone. These new products feature the latest

      technology and connectivity, and our new nutrition line satisfies a

      broad set of needs with proprietary formulas that provide great taste

      while burning fat and building muscle," said Bruce Cazenave, CEO of

      Nautilus Inc. "The return of the Nautilus brand to the home use market

      is also a major milestone for the company, as is the debut of the

      world's first smart dumbbells offering digital connectivity and the

      Three Dimensional Trainer (3DT) that tracks sets, reps, weight and even

      speed."

    

Expanded Product Portfolio Offers Wide Array of

      Fitness Solutions:


Bowflex Body™ Line: Unprecedented Nutrition and Energy



      Based on advanced science and proprietary formulas, the Bowflex Body™

      product line will help activate metabolism, support the immune system,

      build muscle, burn calories, provide energy and refuel the body. Created

      by renowned nutritional chemists, the Bowflex Body™ shake can be used as

      a pre- or post-workout energy booster, as well as a meal replacement

      with all the necessary nutrition.

    


      The Bowflex Body™ product line includes a French Vanilla-flavored

      Fitness Shake that contains premium proteins, beneficial fibers,

      essential nutrients and powerful antioxidants, while other flavors add

      further benefits such as weight loss or general wellness.

    



        Rich Chocolate Fat Burner+ Shake Boost: Enhanced fat burning

        power and metabolism boost to aid in weight loss

      


        Mixed Berry Antioxidant+ Shake Boost: An antioxidant and

        immunity blend to protect the body and fight free radicals

        help stimulate muscle growth, increase energy and enhance performance

      



      The lineup also features two additional energy formulas, Pre-Workout

      Energy and Daily Energy. Pre-Workout Energy is a berry

      pomegranate-flavored formula designed to improve aerobic and anaerobic

      performance, promote recovery and provide powerful, fast-acting energy

      without the crash. The passion fruit-flavored Daily Energy formula

Bowflex® SelectTech® 560s: Dumbbells Just Got Smart


Nautilus Inc. also announced its upcoming release of the new Bowflex®

      SelectTech® 560 Dumbbells, the first-ever smart dumbbell, offering users

      a fully interactive digital experience. The 560's Three Dimensional

      Trainer (3DT) records and counts reps, weight lifted and rep speed,

      provides sound cues for rest time between sets and can also track

      calories burned. A free downloadable app available for iOS and Android

      offers step-by-step video workouts with over 70 exercises and records

      workout history so that progress can be tracked and shared.

    


      In addition to digital smarts, the Bowflex® SelectTech® 560 features a

      unique industrial design, making it more compact with a smooth, easy

      weight-changing mechanism in the handle. Created specifically for

      in-home use, the innovative design reduces the number of separate

      dumbbells from 32 down to only two — maximizing space savings and

      storage. The Bowflex® SelectTech® 560 offers expanded weight options, so

      users can progress at their own pace, and allows for greater

      customization to target and sculpt the entire body.

Nautilus® Cardio Series: Combining Quality and Connectivity



      The return of the Nautilus® brand is a milestone for Nautilus Inc.,

      bringing its heritage of innovative and high-quality design to its new

      Nautilus cardio series of elliptical, treadmill, and upright and

      recumbent bikes. The top-of-the-line 616 products combine premium

      features with ground-breaking technology to offer users the ultimate

      at-home workout experience.

    


      These smart machines feature a DualTrack™ multi-LCD display console with

      Bluetooth® Smart technology, so users have access to the new Nautilus®

      Trainer™ app, which offers more than 20 customizable programs to track

      workout time, distance traveled and calories burned. A first of its

      kind, the Nautilus® Trainer™ app allows users to tailor goal-setting and

      track the metrics based on personal preference. In addition, the app

      provides real-time coaching to monitor progress during the workout.

    


      Users can also sync, record and store every workout for quick reference

      and share results with friends and family through MyFitnessPal®.

Organization[edit]
Nautilus, Inc. is the maker of home fitness equipment brands Bowflex, Nautilus, Schwinn Fitness and Universal Gym Equipment, sold directly to customers through a combination of television commercials, infomercials, response mailings, the Internet and inbound/outbound call centers. Select Bowflex home gyms and Schwinn cardio equipment are also available in retail stores.[6]
In 2015, the company opened a new building across from its headquarters in Vancouver, Washington, United States to expand its development and research team.[6]
Brian Cook, held the CEO position for 17 years, from to 1986 to 2003 when he was replaced by Gregg Hammann.[7][8] who resigned in August 2007 after sales fell to $134 million from $159.6 million in 2006.[9]
In 2007, after Hammann’s departure, Robert S. Falcone, the former Nike chief financial officer, became the Nautilus, Inc. interim chief executive officer,[10] where he also served as president and chairman since October 17, 2007.[11] In April 2008, Falcone was replaced by Edward Bramson, a major stock owner.[12] Under Bramson’s leadership, the company changed sales focus to solely direct-to-customer and retail businesses, which resulted in the sale of its StairMaster brand.[12] Bramson was CEO and chairman of Nautilus, Inc. until May 2011, when he announced he would be stepping down and Bruce M. Cazenave, former executive with Black and Decker and Timberland, would be the new CEO.[12]
Bruce M. Cazenave is the current CEO of Nautilus, Inc. and since he’s taken over in 2011, his plan has been to release better and more cost-effective retail products.[6]
History[edit]
The current corporate flavor of Nautilus, Inc. originated in 1986 with the sale of most of the company by the inventor of the Nautilus machine, Arthur Jones.[13] Jones created the Nautilus machine, then called the Blue Monster, in the late 1960s, with the purpose of creating a fitness machine that accommodates human movement.[13] The company's name was changed to Nautilus because the logarithmic-spiral cam, which made the machine a success, resembled a nautilus.[13] On August 28, 2007, Jones died from natural causes at his home in Ocala, Florida, at the age of 80.[13]
Bowflex acquired Nautilus, Inc. and specialized in designing, developing and marketing strength and cardio fitness products.[6] In 1997, the company changed its name to Direct Focus and acquired Nautilus, Schwinn and StairMaster between 1999 and 2002, before changing its name to Nautilus, Inc.[6] Nautilus became a publicly traded company in May 1999.[14]
The company stopped selling exercise equipment to gyms in 2011 and shifted its focus to home-use equipment. The same year, Nautilus, Inc. licensed its brand name and technology to other manufacturers.[6]
In June 2014, Nautilus, Inc. was sued by Biosig Instruments for allegedly infringing its heart-rate monitor's design for its Bowflex Boost activity tracker.[15] The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Nautilus, Inc. because the Biosig Instruments patent was not precise enough.[15]
For two years running (2013 & 2014), Nautilus, Inc. was recognized by The Oregonian as one of the top places to work,[16][17] as well as the company with the healthiest employees of Oregon by the Portland Business Journal, in its 101-500 employee category.[18]
The company has been an American Heart Association Fit-Friendly company since 2010, winning for three consecutive years the Platinum Fit-Friendly Workplace award.[19][20] The company is recognized for its Road to Wellness Program, which challenges and rewards Nautilus, Inc. employees to get healthier by just walking.[20]
In June 2013, a number of Nautilus employees participated in the Tough Mudder in Fossil, Oregon. The race is a 10-mile obstacle course which serves as a way to raise money for the Wounded Warrior Project.[21]
Finance[edit]
On March 18, 2014, Bruce Cazenave, CEO of Nautilus, Inc., rang the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell. Nautilus, Inc. also featured its new home fitness cardio machine, Bowflex MAX Trainer, on the NYSE trading floor and discussed the company’s 2013 fourth quarter and full year financial growth.[22]
In 2013, Nautilus, Inc. posted $218.8 million in revenue, a 13% increase over 2012.[6][23] The company’s financial performance in the past two years has led to Nautilus, Inc. landing at No. 4 on The Seattle Times’ 23rd annual ranking of publicly traded companies based in the Northwest.[6]
Since 2012, the company’s stock has increased to more than $11 a share.[6]
During the Great Recession, between 2007 and 2010, Nautilus, Inc. saw almost $255 million in losses, with its stock ranging from 45 cents to $4, between 2009 and 2012.[6]
Products[edit]
The Bowflex brand includes cardio machines Bowflex MAX Trainer[24] and Bowflex TreadClimber,[14] the SelectTech Adjustable Dumbbells[25] for strength training, and Bowflex Xtreme 2 Home Gym[26] and Bowflex Revolution Home Gym.[27]
The Schwinn brand includes cardio machine products such as the Schwinn AirDyne Bike, designed to challenge users’ entire body by increasing more wind resistance the harder they pedal against the fan.[28] The brand also includes Schwinn Ellipticals[29] and Schwinn Recumbent Bikes.[30]
The Nautilus brand sells through retail the Nautilus E514c Elliptical cardio machine made from tubular steel for strength and durability. The E514c Elliptical also includes a LCD display, which tracks users' progress and heart rate.[31] The brand also includes Nautilus T614 treadmill which comes with 22 workout programs.[32] The new 2014 Nautilus cardio brand machines include multi LCD display with Bluetooth® Smart Technology and sync with MyFitnessPal.[33]

Organization[edit]
Nautilus, Inc. is the maker of home fitness equipment brands Bowflex, Nautilus, Schwinn Fitness and Universal Gym Equipment, sold directly to customers through a combination of television commercials, infomercials, response mailings, the Internet and inbound/outbound call centers. Select Bowflex home gyms and Schwinn cardio equipment are also available in retail stores.[6]
In 2015, the company opened a new building across from its headquarters in Vancouver, Washington, United States to expand its development and research team.[6]
Brian Cook, held the CEO position for 17 years, from to 1986 to 2003 when he was replaced by Gregg Hammann.[7][8] who resigned in August 2007 after sales fell to $134 million from $159.6 million in 2006.[9]
In 2007, after Hammann’s departure, Robert S. Falcone, the former Nike chief financial officer, became the Nautilus, Inc. interim chief executive officer,[10] where he also served as president and chairman since October 17, 2007.[11] In April 2008, Falcone was replaced by Edward Bramson, a major stock owner.[12] Under Bramson’s leadership, the company changed sales focus to solely direct-to-customer and retail businesses, which resulted in the sale of its StairMaster brand.[12] Bramson was CEO and chairman of Nautilus, Inc. until May 2011, when he announced he would be stepping down and Bruce M. Cazenave, former executive with Black and Decker and Timberland, would be the new CEO.[12]
Bruce M. Cazenave is the current CEO of Nautilus, Inc. and since he’s taken over in 2011, his plan has been to release better and more cost-effective retail products.[6]
History[edit]
The current corporate flavor of Nautilus, Inc. originated in 1986 with the sale of most of the company by the inventor of the Nautilus machine, Arthur Jones.[13] Jones created the Nautilus machine, then called the Blue Monster, in the late 1960s, with the purpose of creating a fitness machine that accommodates human movement.[13] The company's name was changed to Nautilus because the logarithmic-spiral cam, which made the machine a success, resembled a nautilus.[13] On August 28, 2007, Jones died from natural causes at his home in Ocala, Florida, at the age of 80.[13]
Bowflex acquired Nautilus, Inc. and specialized in designing, developing and marketing strength and cardio fitness products.[6] In 1997, the company changed its name to Direct Focus and acquired Nautilus, Schwinn and StairMaster between 1999 and 2002, before changing its name to Nautilus, Inc.[6] Nautilus became a publicly traded company in May 1999.[14]
The company stopped selling exercise equipment to gyms in 2011 and shifted its focus to home-use equipment. The same year, Nautilus, Inc. licensed its brand name and technology to other manufacturers.[6]
In June 2014, Nautilus, Inc. was sued by Biosig Instruments for allegedly infringing its heart-rate monitor's design for its Bowflex Boost activity tracker.[15] The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Nautilus, Inc. because the Biosig Instruments patent was not precise enough.[15]
For two years running (2013 & 2014), Nautilus, Inc. was recognized by The Oregonian as one of the top places to work,[16][17] as well as the company with the healthiest employees of Oregon by the Portland Business Journal, in its 101-500 employee category.[18]
The company has been an American Heart Association Fit-Friendly company since 2010, winning for three consecutive years the Platinum Fit-Friendly Workplace award.[19][20] The company is recognized for its Road to Wellness Program, which challenges and rewards Nautilus, Inc. employees to get healthier by just walking.[20]
In June 2013, a number of Nautilus employees participated in the Tough Mudder in Fossil, Oregon. The race is a 10-mile obstacle course which serves as a way to raise money for the Wounded Warrior Project.[21]
Finance[edit]
On March 18, 2014, Bruce Cazenave, CEO of Nautilus, Inc., rang the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell. Nautilus, Inc. also featured its new home fitness cardio machine, Bowflex MAX Trainer, on the NYSE trading floor and discussed the company’s 2013 fourth quarter and full year financial growth.[22]
In 2013, Nautilus, Inc. posted $218.8 million in revenue, a 13% increase over 2012.[6][23] The company’s financial performance in the past two years has led to Nautilus, Inc. landing at No. 4 on The Seattle Times’ 23rd annual ranking of publicly traded companies based in the Northwest.[6]
Since 2012, the company’s stock has increased to more than $11 a share.[6]
During the Great Recession, between 2007 and 2010, Nautilus, Inc. saw almost $255 million in losses, with its stock ranging from 45 cents to $4, between 2009 and 2012.[6]
Products[edit]
The Bowflex brand includes cardio machines Bowflex MAX Trainer[24] and Bowflex TreadClimber,[14] the SelectTech Adjustable Dumbbells[25] for strength training, and Bowflex Xtreme 2 Home Gym[26] and Bowflex Revolution Home Gym.[27]
The Schwinn brand includes cardio machine products such as the Schwinn AirDyne Bike, designed to challenge users’ entire body by increasing more wind resistance the harder they pedal against the fan.[28] The brand also includes Schwinn Ellipticals[29] and Schwinn Recumbent Bikes.[30]
The Nautilus brand sells through retail the Nautilus E514c Elliptical cardio machine made from tubular steel for strength and durability. The E514c Elliptical also includes a LCD display, which tracks users' progress and heart rate.[31] The brand also includes Nautilus T614 treadmill which comes with 22 workout programs.[32] The new 2014 Nautilus cardio brand machines include multi LCD display with Bluetooth® Smart Technology and sync with MyFitnessPal.[33]
The Universal Gym Equipment brand sells selectorized dumbbells[34]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
