Education and family[edit]
Pozen grew up in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he attended public high school and won a scholarship to attend Harvard College. In 1968, he graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard, which awarded him a Knox Traveling Fellowship.
In 1972, Pozen received a law degree from Yale Law School, where he served on the editorial board of the Yale Law Journal. He received a JSD from Yale in 1973 for his doctoral thesis on state enterprises in Africa. He is a member of the Massachusetts, New York and Washington, D.C. bars.
He has been married for more than 30 years to Elizabeth Kelner Pozen, a psychotherapist and figurative painter. They live in Boston, Massachusetts, and have two adult children, Joanna and David.
Investment industry career[edit]
Pozen was an executive at Fidelity Investments from 1987 to 2001, eventually rising to vice chairman of the company and president of FMR Co., the investment adviser to Fidelity’s mutual funds. In the latter role, he had oversight of Fidelity’s global portfolio management and research teams; during his tenure as president, Fidelity’s assets under management increased from $500 billion to $900 billion. He also was a director of Fidelity’s insurance company and credit card bank.
Pozen became chairman of MFS Investment Management in February 2004. In that position, he advised the firm on strategic initiatives and long-term planning. Speaking on corporate governance, he has been credited with enhancing the organization’s legal, audit, and risk functions. He retired as Chairman in July 2010 and is now Chairman Emeritus. He continues to serve as a member of the MFS mutual fund boards. In 2011, he was recognized for his work in the mutual fund industry with the Fund Action Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2001 and 2002, he served as a member of President George W. Bush's Commission to Strengthen Social Security. His proposal for utilizing a "progressive indexing" methodology to address Social Security’s long-term solvency issue received national attention, including a mention during President Bush's 2006 State of the Union address.
At the state level, Pozen served as Secretary of Economic Affairs in 2003 under then-Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Pozen was responsible for all economic-related areas, including banking, consumer affairs, insurance, and labor.

Education and family[edit]
Pozen grew up in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where he attended public high school and won a scholarship to attend Harvard College. In 1968, he graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Harvard, which awarded him a Knox Traveling Fellowship.
In 1972, Pozen received a law degree from Yale Law School, where he served on the editorial board of the Yale Law Journal. He received a JSD from Yale in 1973 for his doctoral thesis on state enterprises in Africa. He is a member of the Massachusetts, New York and Washington, D.C. bars.
He has been married for more than 30 years to Elizabeth Kelner Pozen, a psychotherapist and figurative painter. They live in Boston, Massachusetts, and have two adult children, Joanna and David.

He also was a director of Fidelity’s insurance company and credit card bank.
Pozen became chairman of MFS Investment Management in February 2004. In that position, he advised the firm on strategic initiatives and long-term planning. Speaking on corporate governance, he has been credited with enhancing the organization’s legal, audit, and risk functions. He retired as Chairman in July 2010 and is now Chairman Emeritus. He continues to serve as a member of the MFS mutual fund boards. In 2011, he was recognized for his work in the mutual fund industry with the Fund Action Lifetime Achievement Award.

                           Pozen shows that in order to be truly productive, professionals must make a critical shift in their mind-set: from hours worked
                              to results produced. He helps people at all stages of their careers read, write, and make presentations quicker and more effectively.
                              He provides professionals with practical tips on how to efficiently use their time in the office-while leading full and productive
                              personal lives as well"--

                              and more than 60 million individual shareholders. Yet there has been no book on the mutual fund business designed for MBA
                              and undergraduate business courses. The Mutual Fund Business, assembled by a leading industry expert, fills this gap." "Each
                              chapter contains not only a lengthy introduction and selected articles, but also a detailed case study or class exercise.
                              The book is accompanied by an extensive teacher's manual, with a complete set of lecture notes, slides (on diskette) to support
                              the lectures, answers to the review questions for each chapter, and an analysis of each case study."--Jacket

                           The recent credit crisis and the resulting bailout program are unprecedented events in the financial industry. While it's
                              important to understand what got us here, it's even more important to consider how we should get out. While there is little
                              question that immediate action was required to stabilize the situation, it is now time to look for a long-term plan to reform
                              the United States financial industry. That is where Bob Pozen comes in. Perhaps more than anyone in the industry, Pozen commands
                              the respect and attention of the public and private sector. In this timely guide, he outlines his vision for the new financial
                              future and provides actionable advice along the way. To Pozen, there are four high-priority problems that must be addressed,
                              and this book puts them in perspective

Extreme Productivity Book


You’re viewing the launch page for Bob Pozen’s new book, Extreme Productivity. Click here to continue to the homepage >>




EXTREME PRODUCTIVITY
Boost Your Results, Reduce Your Hours

Bob Pozen gets a lot done. He’s taught a full course load at Harvard Business School while serving as the full-time chairman of a global financial services firm. He’s written six books and hundreds of articles, served on many boards of local charities and public companies, and raised a family with his wife of more than four decades. For over forty years, Pozen has worked smarter and faster than almost anyone around him.
In Extreme Productivity, Pozen reveals his secrets to workplace
productivity and high performance. The antidote to a calendar full of
boring meetings and a backlog of emails, his book shows professionals how
they can achieve their goals by making a critical shift in mindset: from
hours worked to results produced.

Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky

Here, the productivity guru–efficiently!–shares what you really need to know about achieving peak career performance.
By Drake Baer5 minute Read“No matter what your career aspirations are,” writes Robert Pozen in Extreme Productivity, “you should begin by thinking carefully about why you are engaging in any activity and what you can expect to get out of it.”advertisementFor Pozen, marrying an understanding of the big picture (how to form and place your goals) to the small picture (how to bring them to bear on your schedule), is the essence of productivity.
Robert PozenGiven that he once simultaneously served as president of Fidelity Management & Research Company and a full-time lecturer at Harvard Business School (while dashing off articles for Harvard Business Review on the side–read his enviable CV here if you dare), it’s clear everyone could learn a thing or two from Pozen about how to work well, and not become overwhelmed.The “hubris” of career planningChatting in the Fast Company offices, Pozen describes how he “backed into” each step of his career–an instructive path to consider for anyone who’s been left tongue-tied by the interview question, “Tell me where you want to be in five years.”Pozen went to Harvard for undergrad, then Yale for law school, and soon started teaching at Georgetown and NYU. He felt he couldn’t make an impact through academia, so he moved to D.C. to become associate general counsel at the SEC. Then, needing to support his family, he became partner at a D.C. law firm, Caplin & Drysdale. However, he soon saw that the client side was more interesting, and so moved to Fidelity Investments to become general counsel in 1986. By the time he retired in 2001, he had become president–something he couldn’t have predicted way back in his SEC days.The moves he made showcase what he calls “step-by-step optionality,” a career-planning philosophy that emphasizes developing skills that meet the marketplace. Instead of asking “where do I want to be in 20 years?”–which he calls an “act of hubris” for its assumption of controlling a career, Pozen advocates a measured, probabilistic approach, establishing long-, medium-, and short-term goals.“Priorities are the yearly goals that I’m most interested in achieving,” he says, “then they become operationalized through weekly goals.” How to decide on those priorities–and how to implement them–requires further thought.advertisementSupply and demandThe wisdom of “find your passion” only gets at half of the equation, Pozen says. While vitally important for personal happiness, the questions of “What am I best at?” and “What do I like most to do?” only address the supply side, he says. (Consider, for instance, how many college guys want to become sportscasters.) Equally important is the demand side, considering what your organization and your world are looking for. (Not a ton of sportscasters.)The trick, then, is seeing what skills will be needed in your organization and your industry and developing them in yourself, Pozen says. Sometimes it’s clear: If your company’s moving into Latin America, you might want to learn Spanish. He recommends getting on your boss’s wavelength by asking questions like “What are we trying to do in the next year?” and “Where do we see our expansions, where do we see our contractions?”–that way you’ll know what the influencers are looking for.Similarly, as you navigate through the industry, you need to be informed. You do your reading, you can go to conferences, but most importantly, you’ve got to talk. “The most important thing is to talk to people that have jobs that you might like and to see what they say the job involves,” Pozen says. If you don’t, there’s a risk of having an unrealistic or romanticized view of the skills required to get a given gig. You might need to be able to read a financial statement or code computer programs, but you can’t know if you don’t ask, he says. When you know (or have an idea) of what skills will be in demand, you can set upon getting them.To level up your skills, you want to always be looking for on-the-job training, whether structured or not. “Some companies offer formal courses,” he says, “but you can structure your work life so as to gain those skills.” Some skills, like management, are broadly transferable; if you’re given a choice to manage, take it, as it will open up later options. Same with experience abroad–it avails international work. “If you have that mindset, then you’re always looking in your current job for ways to increase your options in the future by gaining new skills, new experiences, (and) new contacts.”To make these goals happen, you need to operationalize them.Minimize your routine, maximize your timeEveryone–including President Obama–is better off with a uniform of sorts. Pozen wears the same thing every day (a dark suit), and recommends that you do, too (“unless you work in fashion,” he adds.) “You need to get through your routine as fast as possible,” he says, so that you can invest your energy in projects that further your yearly ambitions–whether you wear dark or light socks is probably of lesser consequence, and making even the smallest of choices day after day drains your decision-making ability. It’s the same reason he eats Cheerios and bananas for breakfast and a sandwich and a diet soda for lunch each day–your decision-making energy needs to be wisely invested.advertisement

Clothed and fed, the next step is email, for which Pozen has a pair of rules: 80/20 and OHIO. The first has caught on in the startup scene–meaning that you get most of your value from 20 percent of your work. “You have to take your email and discard 80 percent,” he says, “but that 15-20 percent is important to you, deal with it right then, because if you say I’ll get to it next week, you’ll invariably spend an hour on it (then).” That’s where OHIO–Only Handle It Once–comes in. If the task is important, handle it immediately.To calibrate daily activities to yearly goals, Pozen recommends a two-sided schedule. At the end of your day, plot out your time spent in two columns. List each activity on the left and describe its purpose on the right. If the right side doesn’t pursue your priorities–cultivating transferable skills, expanding your contacts, the like–then you have a mismatch between what you want to do (and who you want to be) and what you’re actually doing.Your daily schedule needs to be connected to your yearly objectives; if not, you’re just getting through the day. “If you want an active schedule,” he says, “you have to husband your time so you can act on the things that are important.”Drake Baer covers leadership for Fast Company.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
