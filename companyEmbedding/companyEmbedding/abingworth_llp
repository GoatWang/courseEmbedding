11 life science funds





Abingworth has raised 11 funds dedicated to investing in life sciences and healthcare. Our most recent, Abingworth Clinical Co-Development Fund and Abingworth Bioventures VI, raised $108 million and £225 million ($375 million) respectively and are actively investing.
Venture Funds
Our venture funds invest across our broad strategic areas of venture capital, pharmaceutical co-development, VIPEs and public markets. They focus primarily on private companies but are able to invest a percentage of their value in public companies.
Public Market Fund
Abingworth BioEquities (ABE) is dedicated solely to investing in public life science companies. Employing a long-only investment approach, our open-ended fund invests worldwide in public small-cap life sciences companies taking leadership positions in syndicated deals, participating in private placements as well as buying and selling shares in the open market.

"Abingworth became a significant investor in Lombard Medical as we moved towards global regulatory approval and commercial launch for our lead product. Their experience and extensive network of worldwide contacts has been incredibly helpful to the management team and has had a very positive impact on the company at a critical time."
Simon Hubbert, CEO of Lombard Medical









Public markets





Using our networks, financial expertise and knowledge of the life science industry, we identify and invest in small-cap public companies that we believe are under-valued.  Engaging in detailed analysis of public companies before we invest, we usually remain shareholders until the investment case has played out. This could be until data from a clinical trial is released, a partnering deal is signed or a drug is approved.
We are undeterred by illogical share price drops on minor company news or periods of market weakness. Quite the opposite, we view these as potential opportunities to invest.
Abingworth BioEquities
We invest in public small-cap life science companies through our venture funds and through a separate fund, Abingworth BioEquities (ABE). ABE is a long-only, open-ended, fund that invests globally in public life science companies.
ABE has two complementary investment styles: passive and active. Our passive investments, which make up the majority of the fund by number, are focused on well managed, well capitalised companies with drug or technology assets that we believe are undervalued. Our active investments are VIPEs (Venture Investment in Public Equity) where the company needs new capital and restructuring. These are typically larger investments, led by Abingworth’s venture funds.
For more information about ABE contact Kurt von Emster or Andrew Sinclair.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Abingworth LLP (formerly Abingworth Management Ltd) is a London-based independent venture capital firm and registered investment advisory firm founded in 1973 by a pair of London stockbrokers, Peter Dicks and Anthony Montagu.[1][2][3]:51 Abingworth had initially sought to extend its investments into the biotechnology industry in the late 1980s,[3]:51 and has subsequently been investing in life science and healthcare services companies since at least 2001,[4] and had expanded to include information technology firm investments by 2016.[1]

Offices[edit]
In addition to its base in London, the company had a second office in Palo Alto, California as of 2001.[citation needed] By 2016, the Palo Alto office had been replaced by an office in Menlo Park, and an additional offices had been established in Boston, Massachusetts and Cambridge, United Kingdom.[1]
Investments[edit]
The company's investment strategy involves the establishment of funds with particular investment targets in mind. For instance, the "Bioventures VI" fund was "closed" in March 2014, having accrued $375 million, reportedly exceeding the "target" for the fund.[5] A key element in the firm's investment strategy is the exit, which signifies the acquisition of or initial public offering by a company in which the firm has invested.[5]
Prior to 1987, Abingworth had made investments, considered by 2016 to have been successful, in Apple and Silicon Graphics.[3]:51
The firm created its biotech investment arm in 1987.[3]:57 Among the first investments was in Immunology Ltd, which was later renamed to Cantab Pharmaceuticals.[3]:57 In 2000, the company joined several others in providing funding for Oxagen.[3]:80 In the early 2000s, the firm invested in and saw forward to initial public offering a number of firms, including Dicerna Pharmaceuticals and Clovis Oncology.[5][6] The firm has also provided funding to support the acquisition of Algeta by Bayer and Avila Therapeutics by Celgene.[6][7][8][9] In the Algeta case, this was the very first of the firm's venture investments in public equities, dating to February 2009.[5]
In 2013, the firm realized an exit from investment in Syntaxin Ltd when it was acquired by Ipsen SA.[5]
In 2013, the firm invested in Effector Therapeutics.[5][6] It also, in January 2013, set up Avillion Group Partners, a clinical phase III co-development accelerator, with Massachusetts-based Clarus Ventures.[5] Following from this, Avillion partnered with Pfizer on a label expansion effort for Bosulif.[5]
In 2014, the firm invested in two ophthalmic companies, Avedro and Gensight Biologics.[5]
Corporate details[edit]
As of 2001[update], Abingworth had less than 10 employees.[citation needed] By 2016, the firm had at least 20 employees.[4]
As of 2016[update], there were two managing partners, Timothy J. Haines and Kurt von Emster.[1]
James Abell has held the post of chief financial officer since at least 2001.[1]
"Special partner" David Leathers joined the firm in 1987, having left Rothchild.[3]:51
The company also has a board of directors, which consisted of two members in 2016, Stephen Bunting and Theodore Clark.[1] Bunting had been a managing partner from 2002 to at least 2014,[6] having joined Abingworth in 1987 after leaving Rothchild with Leathers.[3]:51 By 2014, Bunting had been involved in the establishment each of the ten (at that time) of the company's life science investment funds.[5]
As of 2001[update], the company managed $300 million across several funds and had provided capital to sixty life science companies.[citation needed] More than a decade later, the managed value of one of the firm's ten funds was $375 million.[6]

The company's investment strategy involves the establishment of funds with particular investment targets in mind. For instance, the "Bioventures VI" fund was "closed" in March 2014, having accrued $375 million, reportedly exceeding the "target" for the fund.[5] A key element in the firm's investment strategy is the exit, which signifies the acquisition of or initial public offering by a company in which the firm has invested.[5]
Prior to 1987, Abingworth had made investments, considered by 2016 to have been successful, in Apple and Silicon Graphics.[3]:51
The firm created its biotech investment arm in 1987.[3]:57 Among the first investments was in Immunology Ltd, which was later renamed to Cantab Pharmaceuticals.[3]:57 In 2000, the company joined several others in providing funding for Oxagen.[3]:80 In the early 2000s, the firm invested in and saw forward to initial public offering a number of firms, including Dicerna Pharmaceuticals and Clovis Oncology.[5][6] The firm has also provided funding to support the acquisition of Algeta by Bayer and Avila Therapeutics by Celgene.[6][7][8][9] In the Algeta case, this was the very first of the firm's venture investments in public equities, dating to February 2009.[5]
In 2013, the firm realized an exit from investment in Syntaxin Ltd when it was acquired by Ipsen SA.[5]
In 2013, the firm invested in Effector Therapeutics.[5][6] It also, in January 2013, set up Avillion Group Partners, a clinical phase III co-development accelerator, with Massachusetts-based Clarus Ventures.[5] Following from this, Avillion partnered with Pfizer on a label expansion effort for Bosulif.[5]
In 2014, the firm invested in two ophthalmic companies, Avedro and Gensight Biologics.[5]
Corporate details[edit]
As of 2001[update], Abingworth had less than 10 employees.[citation needed] By 2016, the firm had at least 20 employees.[4]
As of 2016[update], there were two managing partners, Timothy J. Haines and Kurt von Emster.[1]
James Abell has held the post of chief financial officer since at least 2001.[1]
"Special partner" David Leathers joined the firm in 1987, having left Rothchild.[3]:51
The company also has a board of directors, which consisted of two members in 2016, Stephen Bunting and Theodore Clark.[1] Bunting had been a managing partner from 2002 to at least 2014,[6] having joined Abingworth in 1987 after leaving Rothchild with Leathers.[3]:51 By 2014, Bunting had been involved in the establishment each of the ten (at that time) of the company's life science investment funds.[5]
As of 2001[update], the company managed $300 million across several funds and had provided capital to sixty life science companies.[citation needed] More than a decade later, the managed value of one of the firm's ten funds was $375 million.[6]

which is convertible at the option of the holder, subject to the 9.985% Cap, into 2,538,949 shares of Common Stock, at a price

The Reporting Persons acquired the securities reported herein for investment in the ordinary course of business
because of their belief that the Issuer represents an attractive investment based on the Issuer’s business prospects and
strategy. The Reporting Persons reserve the right to acquire, or cause to be acquired, additional securities of the Issuer, to
dispose of, or cause to be disposed of, such securities at any time or to formulate other purposes, plans or proposals regarding
the Issuer or any of its securities, to the extent deemed advisable in light of general investment and trading policies of the
Reporting Persons, market conditions or other factors. Each
Reporting Person may, from time to time, enter into stock trading plans intended to satisfy the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
 
Currently, Timothy Haines, a member, Investment Director and Partner of Abingworth, serves on the Board of
Directors of the Issuer (the “Board”). Mr. Haines was appointed to the Board in May 2014. Mr. Haines also serves
on the Governance and Nominating Committee and the Compensation Committee of the Board. Mr. Haines has been issued, to date, an
aggregate of 33,330 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of options (the “Options”) in connection with
his service as a member of the Board. Abingworth provides advisory services to ABV VI. Under an agreement between Haines and Abingworth,
Haines is deemed to hold the Options and any shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Options for the benefit of ABV
VI, and must exercise the Options solely upon the direction of Abingworth. 26,664 Options were exercisable as of the Event Date
(as defined below) and as of the date of filing of Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D (the “Filing Date”).
The 6,666 shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Options issued to Haines not exercisable within 60 days of the Event
Date and Filing Date will vest at the Issuer’s next annual meeting of stockholders, scheduled for June, 2018.
 
 





 
   
On June 22, 2017 (the “Event Date”), ABV VI entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement
(the “Purchase Agreement”) whereby (i) the Issuer issued and sold to ABV VI, and ABV VI purchased from the Issuer
2,526 shares of Series A Stock, which is convertible at the option of the holder, subject to the 9.985% Cap (as defined below),
into 2,538,949 shares of Common Stock, at a price per share equal to $0.9949, and (ii) the Issuer issued and sold to other purchasers
19,474 shares of Series A Stock which is convertible, at the option of the holders, into 19,571,370 shares of Common Stock, at
a price per share equal to $0.9949. The transactions specified in clauses (i) and (ii) above are referred to herein collective
as the “Private Placement”. The Series A Stock contains a provision prohibiting conversion to the extent that
upon conversion the holder, together with its affiliates and any “group” members, would beneficially own in excess
of 9.985% of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding (the “9.985% Cap”).
 
In connection with the Private Placement, the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Series A
Stock will be entitled to elect one (1) member of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Series A Director”).
Each share of Series A Stock will be entitled to a preference of $0.001 per share upon liquidation of the Company, and thereafter
will share ratably in any distributions or payments on an as-converted basis with the holders of common stock. In addition, if
certain transactions that involve the merger or consolidation of the Company, an exchange or tender offer, a sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company or a reclassification of the Common Stock occur, each of the Series A Stock would be convertible
into the kind and amount of securities, cash and/or other property that the holder of a number of shares of common stock issuable
upon conversion of one share of Series A Stock would receive in connection with such transaction. However, in the event any such
transaction occurs at any time prior to the first date that the volume-weighted average price per share of Common Stock for each
of the trading days during any twenty consecutive trading days ending on or at any time after the one year anniversary of the approval
of the Company’s biologics license application for the Company’s product vonapanitase by the United States Food and
Drug Administration is greater than 200% of the conversion price, and if the aggregate value of such securities, cash and/or property
to which a holder of a share of Series A Stock would be entitled upon conversion would be less than the price per share paid for
the Series A Stock (the “Stated Value”), then each share of Series A Stock shall instead be convertible into
such kind of securities, cash and/or other property with an aggregate value equal to the Stated Value. Except as otherwise required
by law (or with respect to the election of one director to the Company’s Board of Directors and approval of certain actions
specified in the Certificate of Designation), the Series A Stock will not have voting rights.
 
Pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into with each investor in the Private Placement, each
investor, including ABV VI, will be entitled to certain shelf and “piggyback” registration rights with respect to the
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Stock, subject to the limitations set forth in such agreement.
 
Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company,
including ABV VI (each a “Stockholder”) representing a majority of the Company’s outstanding shares of
Common Stock entered into Voting Agreements (each a “Voting Agreement” and, collectively, the “Voting
Agreements”) with the Company, pursuant to which each Stockholder agreed to vote its shares of Common Stock in favor
of those matters in connection with the Private Placement that require approval by the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market. The Voting Agreements terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) immediately following a
meeting of the Company’s stockholders at which the Transaction is voted upon and approved by the Company’s stockholders,
and (ii) the termination of the Purchase Agreement at any time prior to the consummation of the closing contemplated under the
Purchase Agreement.
 







 
Lastly, concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement, the Issuer and certain stockholders
of the Company, including ABV VI, entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement, dated as of June
22, 2017 (the “Fifth IRA”), pursuant to which such stockholders have agreed to certain limitations on the registration
rights provided for under that certain Fourth Amended and Restated Investors’ Rights Agreement, dated as of May 13, 2014,
with the effectiveness of the Fifth IRA to be contingent upon the closing of the Private Placement.
 
The above description of the Purchase Agreement, Certificate of Designation, Registration Rights Agreement,
Voting Agreement and Fifth IRA is qualified in its entirety by reference to such documents, copies of which are filed as exhibits
to Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D.
 
Except as set forth herein, the Reporting Persons do not have any plan or proposal that would relate to, or
result in, any of the matters set forth under subsections (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.
   
Item 5.	  Interest in Securities of the Issuer
 
Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended by deleting it in its entirety and substituting the following in lieu
thereof:

					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Abingworth LLP (formerly Abingworth Management Ltd) is a London-based independent venture capital firm and registered investment advisory firm founded in 1973 by a pair of London stockbrokers, Peter Dicks and Anthony Montagu.[1][2][3]:51 Abingworth had initially sought to extend its investments into the biotechnology industry in the late 1980s,[3]:51 and has subsequently been investing in life science and healthcare services companies since at least 2001,[4] and had expanded to include information technology firm investments by 2016.[1]

Offices[edit]
In addition to its base in London, the company had a second office in Palo Alto, California as of 2001.[citation needed] By 2016, the Palo Alto office had been replaced by an office in Menlo Park, and an additional offices had been established in Boston, Massachusetts and Cambridge, United Kingdom.[1]
Investments[edit]
The company's investment strategy involves the establishment of funds with particular investment targets in mind. For instance, the "Bioventures VI" fund was "closed" in March 2014, having accrued $375 million, reportedly exceeding the "target" for the fund.[5] A key element in the firm's investment strategy is the exit, which signifies the acquisition of or initial public offering by a company in which the firm has invested.[5]
Prior to 1987, Abingworth had made investments, considered by 2016 to have been successful, in Apple and Silicon Graphics.[3]:51
The firm created its biotech investment arm in 1987.[3]:57 Among the first investments was in Immunology Ltd, which was later renamed to Cantab Pharmaceuticals.[3]:57 In 2000, the company joined several others in providing funding for Oxagen.[3]:80 In the early 2000s, the firm invested in and saw forward to initial public offering a number of firms, including Dicerna Pharmaceuticals and Clovis Oncology.[5][6] The firm has also provided funding to support the acquisition of Algeta by Bayer and Avila Therapeutics by Celgene.[6][7][8][9] In the Algeta case, this was the very first of the firm's venture investments in public equities, dating to February 2009.[5]
In 2013, the firm realized an exit from investment in Syntaxin Ltd when it was acquired by Ipsen SA.[5]
In 2013, the firm invested in Effector Therapeutics.[5][6] It also, in January 2013, set up Avillion Group Partners, a clinical phase III co-development accelerator, with Massachusetts-based Clarus Ventures.[5] Following from this, Avillion partnered with Pfizer on a label expansion effort for Bosulif.[5]
In 2014, the firm invested in two ophthalmic companies, Avedro and Gensight Biologics.[5]
Corporate details[edit]
As of 2001[update], Abingworth had less than 10 employees.[citation needed] By 2016, the firm had at least 20 employees.[4]
As of 2016[update], there were two managing partners, Timothy J. Haines and Kurt von Emster.[1]
James Abell has held the post of chief financial officer since at least 2001.[1]
"Special partner" David Leathers joined the firm in 1987, having left Rothchild.[3]:51
The company also has a board of directors, which consisted of two members in 2016, Stephen Bunting and Theodore Clark.[1] Bunting had been a managing partner from 2002 to at least 2014,[6] having joined Abingworth in 1987 after leaving Rothchild with Leathers.[3]:51 By 2014, Bunting had been involved in the establishment each of the ten (at that time) of the company's life science investment funds.[5]
As of 2001[update], the company managed $300 million across several funds and had provided capital to sixty life science companies.[citation needed] More than a decade later, the managed value of one of the firm's ten funds was $375 million.[6]
