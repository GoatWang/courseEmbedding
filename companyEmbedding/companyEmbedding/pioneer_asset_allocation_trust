1 Retail Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

2 Government Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.

^ The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund 
(the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown in the 
performance sub-tab when the fund is hovered over) and the actual performance 
results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have 
lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed 
over the periods shown, would have been higher. 
					

						The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
					
* Some income is subject to state and local taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

With periods of greater volatility and lower growth expected, here’s what to consider when managing your portfolio.

We believe the United States economy is in the mid-cycle phase of a long economic expansion. Alongside this expansion, equity markets have rallied and, after a long period of being undervalued, appear to be near fair value. Even as the U.S. economy transitions to the next leg of the expansion, economies across the world are still struggling to find growth, moderating output on a global level, and leading to extraordinary monetary policies being employed. As a consequence, we expect to see frequent periods of volatility in asset markets. While returns may be lower and more volatile than expected, inflation is also lower, leaving after-inflation real returns less impacted than nominal returns. Given this background of tepid global economic growth, unconventional monetary policy measures, and near fair market valuation, we think it is prudent for investors to look at ways to position and rebalance their portfolios for the second half of 2016 and beyond. 
Checking up on your portfolio
In terms of overall portfolio weightings, as of this writing, we have largely moved to neutral in equities. We maintain a small underweight in fixed income and maintain exposure to alterna­tive investments to improve return potential and hedge volatil­ity. We also hold some cash with a view to deploying it when the opportunity arises. Further, we suggest that rather than using a “set it and forget it” approach, typically associated with a buy-and-hold strategy, clients should thoughtfully manage different sources of return while seeking to achieve their investment goals. Here are seven steps to consider in managing your portfolio, through the second half and later:
Generally: You concentrate to create wealth. You diversify
to maintain wealth.
1. Review investment goals to ensure that they are still relevant. And, equally important, review those goals alongside an asset allocation policy to ensure that they are aligned, improving the probability of being able to fund those goals in the future. 
2. Take periods of volatility in the second half as opportunities to rebalance a portfolio by trimming winners and adding assets that have temporarily lost value.
3. Evaluate concentrated positions of individual securities and asset classes, especially when financial asset prices are high and a period of lower growth is beginning. Carefully examine if there are any remaining marginal benefits in maintaining such a position. If not, consider diversifying to protect against significant portfolio drawdown driven by the large concentrated position. Generally: You concentrate to create wealth. You diversify to maintain wealth.
4. Consider an increase in the role of active investing across and within asset classes as market conditions favorable to active management improve. For some time now, passive funds, such as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, have been popular with investors. Inter-asset class correlations, having been elevated, are now declining relative to historical averages, meaning passive investing may become less effective. This, coupled with higher dispersion in returns across stocks, could be an opportunity for active managers to add meaningful value to portfolios.

5. When investing for yield, be aware that many yield-generating investments — including long-dated bonds, Treasury and agency securities, and certain real estate investment trusts (REITs) — can be particularly sensitive to the impact of rising interest rates. We encourage investors to think about a broader total-return approach, with a focus on appreciation potential, depreciation risk and yield.
6. Manage portfolios for tax efficiency. As we often say, “It’s not what you make, it’s what you keep.” With top effective federal marginal rates at over 40% — net of certain phase-outs and the enactment of the healthcare surcharge — tax-efficient investing and tax-loss harvesting can be effective strategies to defer, minimize and offset income tax liabilities. Therefore, consider the following:

Think about placing tax-inefficient asset classes and strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.
Evaluate the potential tax benefits of certain investments such as ETFs, master limited partnerships, REITS, common stocks and qualified preferred stocks, as well as the tax efficiency of certain managed solutions.
With periods of episodic volatility, think about tax-loss harvesting — using losses to offset taxes on both gains and income — throughout the year.
Remember, tax-advantaged investment management strategies can still provide potential benchmark return exposure while also providing attractive systematic tax-loss-harvesting opportunities and potentially better after-tax returns.

With periods of episodic volatility, think about
tax-loss harvesting throughout the year.
7. Use the natural liquidity of a portfolio to meet spending needs. A diversified portfolio can generate cash flow from stock dividends, bond coupons and other income flows, which can be augmented by rules-based rebalancing where winners are trimmed to generate cash flow while maintaining asset allocation goals.
Considering nonprofits
Many of these recommendations apply to nonprofit organizations (NPOs) as well. In addition, NPOs should review spending rates and smoothing formulas, particularly when they need consistency in spending. They should also review their spending policies to ensure that they are aligned with their asset allocation policy to meet and provide the cash flow they need to sustain programs and/or meet operating needs.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Investing involves risk. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities.
Projections made may not come to pass due to market conditions and fluctuations.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Asset allocation, diversification and rebalancing do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
Any information presented about tax considerations affecting client financial transactions or arrangements is not intended as tax advice and should not be relied upon for the purpose of avoiding any tax penalties. Neither U.S. Trust and its representatives nor its advisors provide tax, accounting or legal advice. Clients should review any planned financial transactions or arrangements that may have tax, accounting or legal implications with their personal professional advisors.
Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Equities Equity securities are subject to stock market fluctuations that occur in response to economic and business developments.
Dividend payments are not guaranteed. The amount of a dividend payment, if any, can vary over time.
Master Limited Partnerships MLPs are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests (limited partnership units or limited liability company units) are traded on securities exchanges like share of common stock. Currently, most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors. Investments in MLP interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors, including commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk.
Fixed Income Investing in fixed-income securities may involve certain risks, including the credit quality of individual issuers, possible prepayments, market or economic developments, and yield and share price fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices generally drop, and vice versa. There may be less information available on the financial condition of issuers of municipal securities than for public corporations. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-exempt income, but it also involves special risks. Income from investing in municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal and state taxes for residents of the issuing state. Interest income from certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to certain state and local taxes and, if applicable, the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
Treasury bills are less volatile than longer-term fixed income securities and are guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by the U.S. government.
International Investing International investing involves special risks, including foreign taxation, currency risks, risks associated with possible differences in financial standards, and other risks associated with future political and economic developments. Investing in emerging markets may involve greater risks than investing in more developed countries. In addition, concentration of investments in a single region may result in greater volatility.
Alternative Investments Alternative investments are intended for qualified and suitable investors only. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Alternative investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk.
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) REITs involve a significant degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. They are only made available to qualified investors under the terms of a private offering memorandum. Holdings in a REIT may be highly leveraged and, therefore, more sensitive to adverse business or financial developments. REITs are long term and unlikely to produce a realized return for investors for a number of years. Investments in real estate securities can be subject to fluctuations in the value of the underlying properties, the effect of economic conditions on real estate values, changes in interest rates and risks related to renting properties, such as rental defaults.


We believe the United States economy is in the mid-cycle phase of a long economic expansion. Alongside this expansion, equity markets have rallied and, after a long period of being undervalued, appear to be near fair value. Even as the U.S. economy transitions to the next leg of the expansion, economies across the world are still struggling to find growth, moderating output on a global level, and leading to extraordinary monetary policies being employed. As a consequence, we expect to see frequent periods of volatility in asset markets. While returns may be lower and more volatile than expected, inflation is also lower, leaving after-inflation real returns less impacted than nominal returns. Given this background of tepid global economic growth, unconventional monetary policy measures, and near fair market valuation, we think it is prudent for investors to look at ways to position and rebalance their portfolios for the second half of 2016 and beyond. 
Checking up on your portfolio
In terms of overall portfolio weightings, as of this writing, we have largely moved to neutral in equities. We maintain a small underweight in fixed income and maintain exposure to alterna­tive investments to improve return potential and hedge volatil­ity. We also hold some cash with a view to deploying it when the opportunity arises. Further, we suggest that rather than using a “set it and forget it” approach, typically associated with a buy-and-hold strategy, clients should thoughtfully manage different sources of return while seeking to achieve their investment goals. Here are seven steps to consider in managing your portfolio, through the second half and later:
Generally: You concentrate to create wealth. You diversify
to maintain wealth.
1. Review investment goals to ensure that they are still relevant. And, equally important, review those goals alongside an asset allocation policy to ensure that they are aligned, improving the probability of being able to fund those goals in the future. 
2. Take periods of volatility in the second half as opportunities to rebalance a portfolio by trimming winners and adding assets that have temporarily lost value.
3. Evaluate concentrated positions of individual securities and asset classes, especially when financial asset prices are high and a period of lower growth is beginning. Carefully examine if there are any remaining marginal benefits in maintaining such a position. If not, consider diversifying to protect against significant portfolio drawdown driven by the large concentrated position. Generally: You concentrate to create wealth. You diversify to maintain wealth.
4. Consider an increase in the role of active investing across and within asset classes as market conditions favorable to active management improve. For some time now, passive funds, such as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, have been popular with investors. Inter-asset class correlations, having been elevated, are now declining relative to historical averages, meaning passive investing may become less effective. This, coupled with higher dispersion in returns across stocks, could be an opportunity for active managers to add meaningful value to portfolios.

5. When investing for yield, be aware that many yield-generating investments — including long-dated bonds, Treasury and agency securities, and certain real estate investment trusts (REITs) — can be particularly sensitive to the impact of rising interest rates. We encourage investors to think about a broader total-return approach, with a focus on appreciation potential, depreciation risk and yield.
6. Manage portfolios for tax efficiency. As we often say, “It’s not what you make, it’s what you keep.” With top effective federal marginal rates at over 40% — net of certain phase-outs and the enactment of the healthcare surcharge — tax-efficient investing and tax-loss harvesting can be effective strategies to defer, minimize and offset income tax liabilities. Therefore, consider the following:

Think about placing tax-inefficient asset classes and strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.
Evaluate the potential tax benefits of certain investments such as ETFs, master limited partnerships, REITS, common stocks and qualified preferred stocks, as well as the tax efficiency of certain managed solutions.
With periods of episodic volatility, think about tax-loss harvesting — using losses to offset taxes on both gains and income — throughout the year.
Remember, tax-advantaged investment management strategies can still provide potential benchmark return exposure while also providing attractive systematic tax-loss-harvesting opportunities and potentially better after-tax returns.

With periods of episodic volatility, think about
tax-loss harvesting throughout the year.
7. Use the natural liquidity of a portfolio to meet spending needs. A diversified portfolio can generate cash flow from stock dividends, bond coupons and other income flows, which can be augmented by rules-based rebalancing where winners are trimmed to generate cash flow while maintaining asset allocation goals.
Considering nonprofits
Many of these recommendations apply to nonprofit organizations (NPOs) as well. In addition, NPOs should review spending rates and smoothing formulas, particularly when they need consistency in spending. They should also review their spending policies to ensure that they are aligned with their asset allocation policy to meet and provide the cash flow they need to sustain programs and/or meet operating needs.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Investing involves risk. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities.
Projections made may not come to pass due to market conditions and fluctuations.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Asset allocation, diversification and rebalancing do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
Any information presented about tax considerations affecting client financial transactions or arrangements is not intended as tax advice and should not be relied upon for the purpose of avoiding any tax penalties. Neither U.S. Trust and its representatives nor its advisors provide tax, accounting or legal advice. Clients should review any planned financial transactions or arrangements that may have tax, accounting or legal implications with their personal professional advisors.
Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Equities Equity securities are subject to stock market fluctuations that occur in response to economic and business developments.
Dividend payments are not guaranteed. The amount of a dividend payment, if any, can vary over time.
Master Limited Partnerships MLPs are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests (limited partnership units or limited liability company units) are traded on securities exchanges like share of common stock. Currently, most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors. Investments in MLP interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors, including commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk.
Fixed Income Investing in fixed-income securities may involve certain risks, including the credit quality of individual issuers, possible prepayments, market or economic developments, and yield and share price fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices generally drop, and vice versa. There may be less information available on the financial condition of issuers of municipal securities than for public corporations. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-exempt income, but it also involves special risks. Income from investing in municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal and state taxes for residents of the issuing state. Interest income from certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to certain state and local taxes and, if applicable, the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
Treasury bills are less volatile than longer-term fixed income securities and are guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by the U.S. government.
International Investing International investing involves special risks, including foreign taxation, currency risks, risks associated with possible differences in financial standards, and other risks associated with future political and economic developments. Investing in emerging markets may involve greater risks than investing in more developed countries. In addition, concentration of investments in a single region may result in greater volatility.
Alternative Investments Alternative investments are intended for qualified and suitable investors only. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Alternative investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk.
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) REITs involve a significant degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative.

 A Flexible and Diversified* Approach to Income Generation


With yields today near record lows and volatility rising, we believe that it is vital to offer a solution to investors who are concerned about the long-term outlook for bonds a strategy that can generate income from a variety of sources.

The Fund has the flexibility to invest in a broad range of income-producing investments, including bonds and other debt securities, dividend-paying** equities and convertible securities.


Portfolio management may seek opportunities in the securities of issuers globally, including in emerging markets.


The Fund can employ various hedging techniques to strive to reduce overall portfolio risk in a changing market environment. These techniques can include selling equity and currency futures, as well as taking positions in volatility futures.

 
* Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss.
 ** Dividends are not guaranteed.
 











The Pioneer Difference


Today's more challenging environment demands an investment strategy that can help investors pursue their income goals across varying rate cycles and market conditions.
 

The Fund's portfolio managers, Marco Pirondini, Tracy Wright, Charles Melchreit and Michele Garau are industry veterans who bring depth of experience in the equity and fixed income markets, as well as asset allocation expertise.


They work with a preeminent credit research team with a long record of managing risk for investors across a wide range of credit cycles.


Our ability to invest across a range of asset classes allows us to invest in securities that we believe can generate income in multiple market environments - even during volatile periods - unlike more limited strategies that do not have the flexibility to invest in such a broad range of securities.

 











Why Consider Pioneer Multi-Asset Income Fund?



The Fund invests globally to seek attractive yield and total return through a diverse range of opportunities.


The flexible, multi-asset approach helps investors pursue diversification.


Portfolio management actively allocates by rebalancing the portfolio regularly based on their evaluation of the current market environment.

 The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is based on a weighted average of the star ratings assigned to a fund's three, five, and ten year (as applicable) time periods. The ratings and rankings are for Class A and Y shares only.

Call 1-800-225-6292 or visit our performance page for the most recent performance results.
 
Ratings and rankings are based on past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load. The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Rankings are based on average annual total returns for listed periods and do not reflect any applicable sales load.

A Word About Risk:
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. Pioneer Multi-Asset Income ("MAI") Fund has the ability to invest in a wide variety of securities and asset classes. High yield bonds possess greater price volatility, illiquidity, and possibility of default. Investments in fixed income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities falls. Prepayment risk is the chance that an issuer may exercise its right to prepay its security, if falling interest rates prompt the issuer to do so. Forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates, the Fund would experience a decline in income and lose the opportunity for additional price appreciation. The Fund may invest in mortgage-backed securities, which during times of fluctuating interest rates may increase or decrease more than other fixed-income securities. Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to pre-payments. The Fund may invest in subordinated securities, which may be disproportionately adversely affected by a default or even a perceived decline in creditworthiness of the issuer. International investments are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations, social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. The Fund may invest in inflation-linked securities. As inflationary expectations increase, inflation-linked securities may become more attractive, because they protect future interest payments against inflation. Conversely, as inflationary concerns decrease, inflation-linked securities will become less attractive and less valuable. The Fund may invest in event-linked bonds. The return of principal and the payment of interest on event-linked bonds are contingent on the non-occurrence of a pre-defined "trigger" event, such as a hurricane or an earthquake of a specific magnitude. The Fund may invest in floating rate loans. The value of collateral, if any, securing a floating rate loan can decline or may be insufficient to meet the issuer's obligations or may be difficult to liquidate. The Fund may invest in underlying funds, including ETFs. In addition to the Fund's operating expenses, you will indirectly bear the operating expenses of investments in any underlying funds. Investments in equity securities are subject to price fluctuation. Small-and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. The Fund may invest in Master Limited Partnerships, which are subject to increased risks of liquidity, price valuation, control, voting rights and taxation. In addition, the structure affords fewer protections to investors in the Partnership than direct investors in a corporation. The Fund may invest in zero coupon bonds and payment in kind securities, which may be more speculative and fluctuate more in value than other fixed income securities. The accrual of income from these securities are payable as taxable annual dividends to shareholders. The Fund and some of the underlying funds may use derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. The Fund may invest in credit default swaps, which may in some cases be illiquid, and they increase credit risk since the fund has exposure to both the issuer of the referenced obligation and the counterparty to the credit default swap. The Fund and some of the underlying funds employ leverage, which increases the volatility of investment returns and subjects the Fund to magnified losses if an underlying fund's investments decline in value.
 These risks may increase share price volatility. There is no assurance that these and other strategies used by the Fund or underlying funds will be successful.
Please see the prospectus for a more complete discussion of the Fund's risks.















Before investing, consider the product's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Contact your advisor or Amundi Pioneer for a prospectus or summary prospectus containing this information.

1 Retail Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

2 Government Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.


^ The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund 
(the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown in the 
performance sub-tab when the fund is hovered over) and the actual performance 
results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have 
lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed 
over the periods shown, would have been higher. 
					

						The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
					
* Some income is subject to state and local taxes and the federal alternative minimum tax.

1 Retail Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. Beginning October 14, 2016, the Fund may impose a fee upon the sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell shares if the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the Fund at any time.

2 Government Funds: You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so.

^ The T. Rowe Price Funds-I Class share the portfolio of an existing fund 
(the original share class of the fund is referred to as the "investor class"). 
The total return figures for I Class shares have been calculated using the performance 
data of the investor class up to the inception date of the I Class (shown in the 
performance sub-tab when the fund is hovered over) and the actual performance 
results of the I Class since that date. Because the I Classes are expected to have 
lower expenses than the Investor Classes, the I Class performance, had it existed 
over the periods shown, would have been higher. 
					

						The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.

We believe the United States economy is in the mid-cycle phase of a long economic expansion. Alongside this expansion, equity markets have rallied and, after a long period of being undervalued, appear to be near fair value. Even as the U.S. economy transitions to the next leg of the expansion, economies across the world are still struggling to find growth, moderating output on a global level, and leading to extraordinary monetary policies being employed. As a consequence, we expect to see frequent periods of volatility in asset markets. While returns may be lower and more volatile than expected, inflation is also lower, leaving after-inflation real returns less impacted than nominal returns. Given this background of tepid global economic growth, unconventional monetary policy measures, and near fair market valuation, we think it is prudent for investors to look at ways to position and rebalance their portfolios for the second half of 2016 and beyond. 
Checking up on your portfolio
In terms of overall portfolio weightings, as of this writing, we have largely moved to neutral in equities. We maintain a small underweight in fixed income and maintain exposure to alterna­tive investments to improve return potential and hedge volatil­ity. We also hold some cash with a view to deploying it when the opportunity arises. Further, we suggest that rather than using a “set it and forget it” approach, typically associated with a buy-and-hold strategy, clients should thoughtfully manage different sources of return while seeking to achieve their investment goals. Here are seven steps to consider in managing your portfolio, through the second half and later:
Generally: You concentrate to create wealth. You diversify
to maintain wealth.
1. Review investment goals to ensure that they are still relevant. And, equally important, review those goals alongside an asset allocation policy to ensure that they are aligned, improving the probability of being able to fund those goals in the future. 
2. Take periods of volatility in the second half as opportunities to rebalance a portfolio by trimming winners and adding assets that have temporarily lost value.
3. Evaluate concentrated positions of individual securities and asset classes, especially when financial asset prices are high and a period of lower growth is beginning. Carefully examine if there are any remaining marginal benefits in maintaining such a position. If not, consider diversifying to protect against significant portfolio drawdown driven by the large concentrated position. Generally: You concentrate to create wealth. You diversify to maintain wealth.
4. Consider an increase in the role of active investing across and within asset classes as market conditions favorable to active management improve. For some time now, passive funds, such as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, have been popular with investors. Inter-asset class correlations, having been elevated, are now declining relative to historical averages, meaning passive investing may become less effective. This, coupled with higher dispersion in returns across stocks, could be an opportunity for active managers to add meaningful value to portfolios.

5. When investing for yield, be aware that many yield-generating investments — including long-dated bonds, Treasury and agency securities, and certain real estate investment trusts (REITs) — can be particularly sensitive to the impact of rising interest rates. We encourage investors to think about a broader total-return approach, with a focus on appreciation potential, depreciation risk and yield.
6. Manage portfolios for tax efficiency. As we often say, “It’s not what you make, it’s what you keep.” With top effective federal marginal rates at over 40% — net of certain phase-outs and the enactment of the healthcare surcharge — tax-efficient investing and tax-loss harvesting can be effective strategies to defer, minimize and offset income tax liabilities. Therefore, consider the following:

Think about placing tax-inefficient asset classes and strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.
Evaluate the potential tax benefits of certain investments such as ETFs, master limited partnerships, REITS, common stocks and qualified preferred stocks, as well as the tax efficiency of certain managed solutions.
With periods of episodic volatility, think about tax-loss harvesting — using losses to offset taxes on both gains and income — throughout the year.
Remember, tax-advantaged investment management strategies can still provide potential benchmark return exposure while also providing attractive systematic tax-loss-harvesting opportunities and potentially better after-tax returns.

With periods of episodic volatility, think about
tax-loss harvesting throughout the year.
7. Use the natural liquidity of a portfolio to meet spending needs. A diversified portfolio can generate cash flow from stock dividends, bond coupons and other income flows, which can be augmented by rules-based rebalancing where winners are trimmed to generate cash flow while maintaining asset allocation goals.
Considering nonprofits
Many of these recommendations apply to nonprofit organizations (NPOs) as well. In addition, NPOs should review spending rates and smoothing formulas, particularly when they need consistency in spending. They should also review their spending policies to ensure that they are aligned with their asset allocation policy to meet and provide the cash flow they need to sustain programs and/or meet operating needs.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Investing involves risk. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities.
Projections made may not come to pass due to market conditions and fluctuations.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Asset allocation, diversification and rebalancing do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
Any information presented about tax considerations affecting client financial transactions or arrangements is not intended as tax advice and should not be relied upon for the purpose of avoiding any tax penalties. Neither U.S. Trust and its representatives nor its advisors provide tax, accounting or legal advice. Clients should review any planned financial transactions or arrangements that may have tax, accounting or legal implications with their personal professional advisors.
Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Equities Equity securities are subject to stock market fluctuations that occur in response to economic and business developments.
Dividend payments are not guaranteed. The amount of a dividend payment, if any, can vary over time.
Master Limited Partnerships MLPs are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests (limited partnership units or limited liability company units) are traded on securities exchanges like share of common stock. Currently, most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors. Investments in MLP interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors, including commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk.
Fixed Income Investing in fixed-income securities may involve certain risks, including the credit quality of individual issuers, possible prepayments, market or economic developments, and yield and share price fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices generally drop, and vice versa. There may be less information available on the financial condition of issuers of municipal securities than for public corporations. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-exempt income, but it also involves special risks. Income from investing in municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal and state taxes for residents of the issuing state. Interest income from certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to certain state and local taxes and, if applicable, the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
Treasury bills are less volatile than longer-term fixed income securities and are guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by the U.S. government.
International Investing International investing involves special risks, including foreign taxation, currency risks, risks associated with possible differences in financial standards, and other risks associated with future political and economic developments. Investing in emerging markets may involve greater risks than investing in more developed countries. In addition, concentration of investments in a single region may result in greater volatility.
Alternative Investments Alternative investments are intended for qualified and suitable investors only. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Alternative investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk.
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) REITs involve a significant degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. They are only made available to qualified investors under the terms of a private offering memorandum. Holdings in a REIT may be highly leveraged and, therefore, more sensitive to adverse business or financial developments. REITs are long term and unlikely to produce a realized return for investors for a number of years. Investments in real estate securities can be subject to fluctuations in the value of the underlying properties, the effect of economic conditions on real estate values, changes in interest rates and risks related to renting properties, such as rental defaults.

We believe the United States economy is in the mid-cycle phase of a long economic expansion. Alongside this expansion, equity markets have rallied and, after a long period of being undervalued, appear to be near fair value. Even as the U.S. economy transitions to the next leg of the expansion, economies across the world are still struggling to find growth, moderating output on a global level, and leading to extraordinary monetary policies being employed. As a consequence, we expect to see frequent periods of volatility in asset markets. While returns may be lower and more volatile than expected, inflation is also lower, leaving after-inflation real returns less impacted than nominal returns. Given this background of tepid global economic growth, unconventional monetary policy measures, and near fair market valuation, we think it is prudent for investors to look at ways to position and rebalance their portfolios for the second half of 2016 and beyond.

Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk.
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) REITs involve a significant degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. They are only made available to qualified investors under the terms of a private offering memorandum. Holdings in a REIT may be highly leveraged and, therefore, more sensitive to adverse business or financial developments. REITs are long term and unlikely to produce a realized return for investors for a number of years. Investments in real estate securities can be subject to fluctuations in the value of the underlying properties, the effect of economic conditions on real estate values, changes in interest rates and risks related to renting properties, such as rental defaults.


We believe the United States economy is in the mid-cycle phase of a long economic expansion. Alongside this expansion, equity markets have rallied and, after a long period of being undervalued, appear to be near fair value. Even as the U.S. economy transitions to the next leg of the expansion, economies across the world are still struggling to find growth, moderating output on a global level, and leading to extraordinary monetary policies being employed. As a consequence, we expect to see frequent periods of volatility in asset markets. While returns may be lower and more volatile than expected, inflation is also lower, leaving after-inflation real returns less impacted than nominal returns. Given this background of tepid global economic growth, unconventional monetary policy measures, and near fair market valuation, we think it is prudent for investors to look at ways to position and rebalance their portfolios for the second half of 2016 and beyond. 
Checking up on your portfolio
In terms of overall portfolio weightings, as of this writing, we have largely moved to neutral in equities. We maintain a small underweight in fixed income and maintain exposure to alterna­tive investments to improve return potential and hedge volatil­ity. We also hold some cash with a view to deploying it when the opportunity arises. Further, we suggest that rather than using a “set it and forget it” approach, typically associated with a buy-and-hold strategy, clients should thoughtfully manage different sources of return while seeking to achieve their investment goals. Here are seven steps to consider in managing your portfolio, through the second half and later:
Generally: You concentrate to create wealth. You diversify
to maintain wealth.
1. Review investment goals to ensure that they are still relevant. And, equally important, review those goals alongside an asset allocation policy to ensure that they are aligned, improving the probability of being able to fund those goals in the future. 
2. Take periods of volatility in the second half as opportunities to rebalance a portfolio by trimming winners and adding assets that have temporarily lost value.
3. Evaluate concentrated positions of individual securities and asset classes, especially when financial asset prices are high and a period of lower growth is beginning. Carefully examine if there are any remaining marginal benefits in maintaining such a position. If not, consider diversifying to protect against significant portfolio drawdown driven by the large concentrated position. Generally: You concentrate to create wealth. You diversify to maintain wealth.
4. Consider an increase in the role of active investing across and within asset classes as market conditions favorable to active management improve. For some time now, passive funds, such as exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, have been popular with investors. Inter-asset class correlations, having been elevated, are now declining relative to historical averages, meaning passive investing may become less effective. This, coupled with higher dispersion in returns across stocks, could be an opportunity for active managers to add meaningful value to portfolios.

5. When investing for yield, be aware that many yield-generating investments — including long-dated bonds, Treasury and agency securities, and certain real estate investment trusts (REITs) — can be particularly sensitive to the impact of rising interest rates. We encourage investors to think about a broader total-return approach, with a focus on appreciation potential, depreciation risk and yield.
6. Manage portfolios for tax efficiency. As we often say, “It’s not what you make, it’s what you keep.” With top effective federal marginal rates at over 40% — net of certain phase-outs and the enactment of the healthcare surcharge — tax-efficient investing and tax-loss harvesting can be effective strategies to defer, minimize and offset income tax liabilities. Therefore, consider the following:

Think about placing tax-inefficient asset classes and strategies in tax-advantaged accounts.
Evaluate the potential tax benefits of certain investments such as ETFs, master limited partnerships, REITS, common stocks and qualified preferred stocks, as well as the tax efficiency of certain managed solutions.
With periods of episodic volatility, think about tax-loss harvesting — using losses to offset taxes on both gains and income — throughout the year.
Remember, tax-advantaged investment management strategies can still provide potential benchmark return exposure while also providing attractive systematic tax-loss-harvesting opportunities and potentially better after-tax returns.

With periods of episodic volatility, think about
tax-loss harvesting throughout the year.
7. Use the natural liquidity of a portfolio to meet spending needs. A diversified portfolio can generate cash flow from stock dividends, bond coupons and other income flows, which can be augmented by rules-based rebalancing where winners are trimmed to generate cash flow while maintaining asset allocation goals.
Considering nonprofits
Many of these recommendations apply to nonprofit organizations (NPOs) as well. In addition, NPOs should review spending rates and smoothing formulas, particularly when they need consistency in spending. They should also review their spending policies to ensure that they are aligned with their asset allocation policy to meet and provide the cash flow they need to sustain programs and/or meet operating needs.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Investing involves risk. There is always the potential of losing money when you invest in securities.
Projections made may not come to pass due to market conditions and fluctuations.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Asset allocation, diversification and rebalancing do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
Any information presented about tax considerations affecting client financial transactions or arrangements is not intended as tax advice and should not be relied upon for the purpose of avoiding any tax penalties. Neither U.S. Trust and its representatives nor its advisors provide tax, accounting or legal advice. Clients should review any planned financial transactions or arrangements that may have tax, accounting or legal implications with their personal professional advisors.
Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Equities Equity securities are subject to stock market fluctuations that occur in response to economic and business developments.
Dividend payments are not guaranteed. The amount of a dividend payment, if any, can vary over time.
Master Limited Partnerships MLPs are limited partnerships or limited liability companies that are taxed as partnerships and whose interests (limited partnership units or limited liability company units) are traded on securities exchanges like share of common stock. Currently, most MLPs operate in the energy, natural resources or real estate sectors. Investments in MLP interests are subject to the risks generally applicable to companies in the energy and natural resources sectors, including commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk.
Fixed Income Investing in fixed-income securities may involve certain risks, including the credit quality of individual issuers, possible prepayments, market or economic developments, and yield and share price fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices generally drop, and vice versa. There may be less information available on the financial condition of issuers of municipal securities than for public corporations. The market for municipal bonds may be less liquid than for taxable bonds. Tax-exempt investing offers current tax-exempt income, but it also involves special risks. Income from investing in municipal bonds is generally exempt from federal and state taxes for residents of the issuing state. Interest income from certain tax-exempt bonds may be subject to certain state and local taxes and, if applicable, the alternative minimum tax (AMT).
Treasury bills are less volatile than longer-term fixed income securities and are guaranteed as to timely payment of principal and interest by the U.S. government.
International Investing International investing involves special risks, including foreign taxation, currency risks, risks associated with possible differences in financial standards, and other risks associated with future political and economic developments. Investing in emerging markets may involve greater risks than investing in more developed countries. In addition, concentration of investments in a single region may result in greater volatility.
Alternative Investments Alternative investments are intended for qualified and suitable investors only. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Alternative investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity and your tolerance for risk.
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) REITs involve a significant degree of risk and should be regarded as speculative. They are only made available to qualified investors under the terms of a private offering memorandum. Holdings in a REIT may be highly leveraged and, therefore, more sensitive to adverse business or financial developments.
