				Napco’s Jorge Hevia Explains iBridge Connected Home Dealer Program			

Napco’s Jorge Hevia details the four key elements of the iBridge Connected Home Dealer Program at ISC East. 




November 21, 2014


						Jason Knott					

 
For “vanilla” alarm dealers, getting into the connected home/home automation space can seem daunting. Napco Security Systems (NASDAQ: NSSC) is trying to remove that intimidation factor with its new iBridge Connected Home Dealer Program.
At ISC East 2014, Jorge Hevia, senior vice president of marketing and sales, discusses the various facets of the program in the video below, including training, sales and marketing, and special product pricing.
Just a few months ago, Napco became the first security panel maker to integrate with Control4 (Nasdaq: CTRL) home automation using Control4’s Simple Device Discovery Protocol (SDDP) into its Gemini security panel. SDDP enables automatic discovery of third-party devices. Drivers from SDDP-enabled partner products are automatically uploaded as soon as they’re plugged into the network. A dealer simply drags the product into a project and it’s ready to go.
iBridge is Napco’s Z-Wave and IP hub with a homegrown cloud service.
