Renaissance Capital is a global provider of institutional research, money management, and index design services focused on newly public companies.[2] The company was founded in 1991 and is headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut.[3]
The firm's institutional research service covers newly public companies worldwide. Coverage is initiated prior to the initial public offering (IPO) and continues beyond the IPO during the period when underwriters are restricted from providing research.

Background[edit]
Renaissance Capital was founded in 1991 in the town of Greenwich, Connecticut. Its founders were three friends from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who met in the 1970s – Linda Killian, William Smith and Kathleen Shelton Smith. The latter two are husband and wife.[3]
Services and products[edit]
IPO Home[edit]
Renaissance Capital developed the web portal IPO Home, a tool for IPO traders and investors allowing them to track the performance of IPOs subsequent to their launch. Among the sections featured by the site are a Breaking News section, a Featured IPO section, and an IPO Calendars section.[4]
IPO Index series[edit]
In 2005, Renaissance Capital and FTSE Group launched the FTSE Renaissance IPO Index Series. As the series expanded to encompass a growing number of developed and emerging markets, its name was changed to the FTSE Renaissance Global IPO Index Series. According to a FTSE fact sheet, "Qualified IPOs are added to the indices at the end of their first trading day and removed after approximately two years, when they become seasoned equities."[5][6]
IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund[edit]
The IPO Plus Aftermarket Fund, an almost exclusively IPO-based mutual fund, was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 1998 and is notable for being one of the first mutual funds of its kind.[7] In 2006 the fund managed $20 million in assets.[4] As of 2011, 1999 was the fund's best year, achieving a return of 115%. Its worst year was 2001, when it suffered a 52% loss.[8]
In an interview with Money Magazine, cofounder Kathleen Smith elaborated on Renaissance Capital's IPO selection methodology as involving both short- and long-term considerations. In the short term, the newly public company's potential is evaluated in relation to the overall appeal of its sector as well as in relation to the IPO record of other recently gone-public companies in its valuation bracket. In the long term, greater emphasis is placed on a fundamental analysis of the company as well as on analysis of the ownership interest among the management.[9]
IPOs for Everyone[edit]
In 2001 Renaissance cofounders Linda Killian, Kathleen Smith and William Smith published IPOs for Everyone: The 12 Secrets of Investing in IPOs (John Wiley & Sons), a comprehensive guide to the IPO market for new investors.[10][11] Mario Gabelli called the book, "The Rosetta Stone for individual investors who want to understand how IPOs fit into our free market capital system and how to profit from IPOs."

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume will always reflect consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the BATS exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.

Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the ETF is found.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.

Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).
