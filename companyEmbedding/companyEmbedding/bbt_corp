So what exactly is U? Here’s the two-minute version. U is based on the idea that everyone’s finances are unique and that managing your money should be simple. Let’s take a look inside. First of all, you can still do all the basics. It’s very easy to see your balances, transfer money, pay bills, and deposit checks. But now we’ve separated all of the features into tiles, like you see here. And here’s the cool part: You can create and customize your own financial dashboard based on what’s important to you. So, what if you’re all about rewards? Move your credit card rewards to the top of your dashboard so it’s the first thing you see when you log in. Or maybe you want to move your categorized spending from here to here. Even colors are your choice. Make U your own with a variety of new color themes. Or say you don’t want any of this. Say you want the cleanest dashboard possible. Well, you can skip the fancy tiles and have that, too. But that’s not all. There are a lot of new features, too. For example, now you can see all of your accounts, not just with BB&T. Paying your friends is way easier than it used to be, too. You can pay anyone directly with just their email address or mobile phone number. You get a real banker that you can connect with, or schedule appointments on your time. With Quick View Balance, you can see balances without logging in. You can set your own customized budget with our Plan and Analyze tools, and we’ll track your progress as you go. This is the new receipt tile. It helps you capture and store your receipts, even attach them to your transactions. No more paper needed. What you see today is only the beginning. We’ll continue to add new features that help make your life a little easier and help you make better financial decisions. Then we want to hear about them from you. You can tell us if you like them, or if they need more work, and what we should build next. Because at the end of the day, it’s your bank, it’s your money, and it’s all about you, and that’s what U is all about. Log on or enroll today.

Making Payments



Can I make a payment online?

Making a payment online is automatically included with online banking. You may use the bill payment service through online banking, Quicken and QuickBooks. If you use Quicken or QuickBooks, fees may apply.
Your bill payments will be sent to the recipients you designate, either as a paper check or an electronic funds transfer. All bill payments made are covered by our Online Bill Payment Guarantee.

When do the funds for a payment leave my checking account?

BB&T uses two bill payment types: electronic and paper check. For recipients who do not accept electronic payments, a paper check will be sent by US Mail and the funds are withdrawn from your account after the recipient deposits the check.
For electronic payments, funds are held on the Send On date and withdrawn on the Deliver By date, which is within two business days for recipients who accept electronic payments.
For paper check payments, the paper check will be sent by US Mail and the funds are withdrawn from your account after the recipient deposits the check.
If there is not enough money in your account on the Send On date, BB&T will cancel the payment. You will not incur an NSF fee, but your bill will not be paid. You will need to reschedule your payment when you have adequate funds available in your account.

How far in advance can I make a payment?

Payments can be scheduled for up to one year in advance.

How large can a payment amount be?

Payments can be made in any amount up to $100,000.

Is there a limit to how many payments I can schedule during a single month?

No, there is no limit.

Does BB&T use a third party to process payments?

BB&T partners with a third-party provider to process and deliver payments. All support and claims issues are handled by BB&T. All claims and any client service issues should be directed to our online banking support at 888-BBT-ONLINE (888-228-6654). Online banking support hours are 6 am to midnight ET, seven days a week excluding Christmas Day, December 25.

Can I schedule a repeating payment or transfer?

Yes, you can schedule a repeating payment or transfer by selecting a frequency after you select the recipient and account while making a payment or transferring money. Transfers cannot be scheduled to occur on weekends or bank holidays. A repeating transfer is scheduled for one of those days will be moved to the following business day.

How do I know what type of payment method to use?

If you have a recipient who does not need to receive payment for two to five business days, you can make a bill payment or schedule a future dated ACH payment and wire transfer.
For next-day payments, you can use ACH payments and wire transfer. Many businesses also use ACH for payroll direct deposit. Before you use ACH, you must subscribe. Once you subscribe to the service, there is a two-day wait period until you can use the service.
If you are making an international payment electronically, you will need to use the wire transfer service. Before you use a wire transfer, you must subscribe to the service. Once you subscribe to the service, there is a two-day wait period until you can use the service. If you are not subscribed to this service, please visit your local financial center to make a one-time wire transfer.
ACH payments and wire transfers can be scheduled for a date in the future. Money will not be sent until the date you specify and will arrive at the payment speed selected.

How much does it cost to use the ACH & Wire service?

ACH payments and wire transfers both have a monthly service fee and a fee for each payment sent. See fee schedule.

Who can receive payments?

A recipient can be any company, agency, organization or individual with an address that includes a valid US Postal Service ZIP code, including APO/FPO (military) addresses.

How much bill payment history can I view online?

You can view all bill payments processed in the last 24 months. For access to bill payment information older than 24 months, please call online banking support at 888-BBT-ONLINE (888-228-6654) for assistance.




Transferring Money



Can I transfer funds to and from another financial institution?

Yes, you can transfer funds between certain BB&T accounts and your eligible accounts at another financial institution from Payments & Transfers, using our Outside Transfer Service. Fees may apply, and this feature is not available to all BB&T clients.

How far in advance can I make a transfer?

Transfers can be scheduled for up to one year in advance.

After I transfer money to an account at another bank, when will the funds be credited to that account?

Making ACH Payments & Wire Transfers



What is an ACH payment?

An ACH payment is a payment made through the Automated Clearing House (ACH), a secure, electronic network for financial transactions in the United States. With ACH payments, you can enjoy faster delivery than online bill payment with a service that is less expensive than making wire transfers. ACH payments include direct deposit payroll, federal taxes, business-to-consumer and business-to-business transactions. There is a fee to subscribe to this service.

What is a wire transfer?

A wire transfer is an electronic payment service for transferring funds (for example, through the Federal Reserve Wire Network). There is a fee to subscribe to the ACH & Wire service.

What information do I need to send an ACH payment or wire transfer?

ACH payments and wire transfers require you to have additional information about the recipient's account. Depending on the type of payment, you may need the recipient's ABA routing number, Swift BIC number, account number, street address and/or intermediary bank information.

How large can an ACH payment or wire transfer amount be?

You can send a maximum ACH payment or wire transfer of $75,000.

Is there a limit to how many ACH Payments or wire transfers I can schedule during a single month?

No, but you cannot send more than $75,000 during a period of three consecutive business days.

When I make an ACH payment or wire transfer, when does the money leave my account?

For same-day wire, a hold is placed on the funds, which become unavailable to you as soon as you submit the wire.
For ACH payments, including direct deposit, a hold is placed on the funds, which become unavailable to you the day before the payment date. For instance, if Friday is payday, and you set up the payment on Monday, the funds will be held on Thursday.

How do I use ACH payments to make a federal tax payment?

To send federal tax payments, you must first enroll with the US Department of Treasury at eftps.com. When you enroll, select the payment type that allows your financial institution to initiate your transaction.

How long does it take to set up the ACH & Wire service?

The subscription process for ACH & Wire may take up to two business days. A valid phone number is required to send ACH payments and wire transfers.

How do I cancel my ACH & Wire service?

To cancel the service, please call online support at 888-BBT-ONLINE (888-228-6654).




Multiple User Access



Can I give other people, such as an office manager or bookkeeper, access to my business accounts?

Yes. Small business online banking allows you to provide customized account access for additional users for one monthly fee for the service. You must subscribe to the Multiple User Access service prior to adding the users.
With Multiple User Access you can give your employees and other users the ability to make bill payments, wire transfers or ACH payments. They can also transfer money and use many other features available in small business online banking. For your protection, you can also limit each user's access, including what accounts they can see and which activities they can perform.




Online Statements



What is an online statement?

An online statement is an electronic PDF file of your monthly account statement that can be viewed in online banking. You can save and print your statement. For legal purposes, a printed version of an online statement is the same as a paper statement mailed through the US Mail.

What are the advantages of receiving my statement online instead of through the mail?

Security:

Online statements are secure. They are provided to you through the secure BB&T banking platform.
Online statements reduce the risk of identity theft and fraud by eliminating paper copies.

Convenience:

Online statements are available for viewing at your convenience within hours after they are produced, much faster than waiting for your paper statements in the mail. You can view and download up to 36 months of statements for personal and business checking and savings accounts, and up to 24 months for any other account.
Online statements can be downloaded and saved to a disk, hard drive or portable storage device.
Online statements can be printed for your records.


Do I need special software or tools to view my online statements?

Your online statement is a PDF file, which can be opened with Adobe Reader. If you do not have this software, you can download it at no cost from www.adobe.com.

Which accounts are eligible for online statements?

Current eligible accounts for online statements include:

BB&T checking accounts
BB&T savings accounts
Other deposit accounts that are part of your current consolidated statement, including individual statements and consolidated (grouped) statements
BB&T home equity loans and lines of credit

How much statement history can I view?

You can view and download up to 36 months of statements for personal and business checking and savings accounts, and up to 24 months for any other account.

consumers. Each Fortune 500 company receives a score based on a ratio of favorable to unfavorable impressions among U.S. adults and its overall favorability. This ensures that a score takes into account how well-liked a company is among people who have an opinion of it without penalizing companies that are not consumer-facing.Morning Consult polls thousands of adults across the country each week. The surveys are conducted online using large, established online survey vendors. The data is weighted to approximate a nationally representative sample based on age, race/ethnicity, gender, educational attainment, region, annual household income, home ownership status and marital status.Andrew Harrer — Bloomberg via Getty Images245BB&T Corp.BBT  Revenues ($M)$11,538Revenue Change11.5%Profits ($M)$2,426.0Profit Change16.4%Assets ($M)$219,276Mkt Value as of 3/31/17 ($M)$36,141Employees37,500Previous Rank273Looking for leads, investment insights, or competitive intelligence?GET PREMIUM ACCESSCEOKelly S.

Net income available to common shareholders was a record $631 million, up 16.6 percent from the second quarter of 2016. Earnings per diluted common share were $0.77 for the second quarter of 2017.

"Taxable-equivalent revenues were a record $2.9 billion, up 3.9 percent compared to the second quarter of 2016," King said. "Net interest income was up $18 million and noninterest income was up $90 million from last year. In addition, revenues were up an annualized 10.7 percent, from the first quarter of 2017.

"We are also pleased to receive the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our capital plan that includes a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, an increase of ten percent, and up to $1.88 billion in share repurchases," King said. "This will allow us to continue to provide one of the strongest dividend payouts among all large banks."

(1)  Excludes certain items as detailed in the non-GAAP reconciliations in the Quarterly Performance Summary.

Second Quarter 2017 compared to First Quarter 2017 
Total taxable-equivalent revenues were $2.9 billion for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $75 million compared to the prior quarter, which reflects an increase of $26 million in taxable-equivalent net interest income, while noninterest income was up $49 million.
The net interest margin was 3.47 percent for the second quarter, up one basis point compared to the prior quarter driven by rate increases. Average earning assets increased $822 million, which primarily reflects an $803 million increase in average securities and a $629 million increase in average total loans. These increases were offset by a decrease of $610 million in other earning assets. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $945 million, resulting from a $2.6 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits, which was partially offset by a $1.0 billion increase in long-term debt and a $643 million increase in short-term borrowings.
The annualized yield on the total loan portfolio for the second quarter was 4.36 percent, up six basis points, reflecting the impact of rate increases. The annualized taxable-equivalent yield on the average securities portfolio for the second quarter was 2.49 percent, up seven basis points compared to the prior quarter.
The average annualized cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.30 percent, up four basis points compared to the prior quarter. The average annualized rate on long-term debt was 1.91 percent, up eight basis points compared to the prior quarter. The average annualized rate on short-term borrowings was 0.70 percent, up 27 basis points compared to the prior quarter. The higher rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the impact of rate increases. 
The provision for credit losses was $135 million, which includes a $16 million benefit for purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans, and net charge-offs were $132 million for the second quarter, compared to $148 million and $148 million, respectively, for the prior quarter.
Noninterest income of $1.2 billion was up $49 million compared to the prior quarter primarily due to increased insurance income, investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions and bankcard fees and merchant discounts.
Noninterest expense was $1.7 billion for the second quarter, down $360 million compared to the prior quarter. This decrease was largely a result of the $392 million loss on the early extinguishment of $2.9 billion of higher-cost FHLB advances recorded in the prior quarter. 
The provision for income taxes was $304 million for the second quarter, compared to $104 million for the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 31.1 percent, compared to 19.6 percent for the prior quarter. The increase in the provision for income tax reflects higher earnings. In addition, the prior quarter tax provision included $35 million of excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation plans.
Second Quarter 2017 compared to Second Quarter 2016
Total taxable-equivalent revenues were $2.9 billion for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $108 million compared to the earlier quarter. This reflects an increase of $18 million in taxable-equivalent net interest income and an increase of $90 million in noninterest income. 
Net interest margin was 3.47 percent, up six basis points compared to the earlier quarter. Average earning assets decreased $1.4 billion. The decrease in average earnings assets reflects a $3.1 billion decrease in average securities partially offset by a $1.2 billion increase in average total loans and leases. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $5.6 billion. The decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities reflects an improvement in deposit mix, as average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $3.8 billion and average interest-bearing deposits decreased $3.8 billion. In addition, average long-term debt decreased $1.5 billion. The annualized yield on the total loan portfolio for the second quarter was 4.36 percent, up five basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The annualized taxable-equivalent yield on the average securities portfolio for the second quarter was 2.49 percent, up two basis points compared to the earlier period.
The average annualized cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.30 percent, up seven basis points compared to the earlier quarter. The average annualized rate on long-term debt was 1.91 percent, down 19 basis points compared to the earlier quarter primarily due to benefits from the early extinguishment of higher-cost FHLB advances. The average annualized rate on short-term borrowings was 0.70 percent, up 36 basis points compared to the earlier quarter. 
The provision for credit losses was $135 million, which includes a $16 million benefit for PCI loans, compared to $111 million in the earlier quarter. Net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2017 totaled $132 million compared to $97 million for the earlier quarter.
Noninterest income was $1.2 billion, an increase of $90 million from the earlier quarter. This increase was driven by higher insurance income, FDIC loss share income and bankcard fees and merchant discounts. These increases were partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking income compared to the earlier quarter.
Noninterest expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $1.7 billion, down $55 million compared to the earlier quarter. This decrease was driven by lower merger-related and restructuring charges in the current year.
The provision for income taxes was $304 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $252 million for the earlier quarter. This produced an effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 of 31.1 percent, compared to 30.0 percent for the earlier quarter.

Second Quarter 2017 compared to First Quarter 2017
Noninterest income was $1.2 billion for the second quarter, up $49 million compared to the prior quarter primarily due to increased insurance income, investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions and bankcard fees and merchant discounts.
Insurance income increased $23 million primarily due to seasonality. Bankcard fees and merchant discounts increased $16 million primarily due to a reduction in the accrual for rewards and an increase in volumes. Investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions increased $14 million, as several deals closed this quarter.
Second Quarter 2017 compared to Second Quarter 2016
Noninterest income for the second quarter of 2017 was up $90 million compared to the earlier quarter. This increase was driven by higher insurance income, FDIC loss share income and bankcard fees and merchant discounts. These increases were partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking income compared to the earlier quarter.
FDIC loss share income increased $64 million due to the termination of the loss sharing agreements during the third quarter of 2016. Insurance income increased $16 million, primarily due to the timing of wholesale commission payments. Bankcard fees and merchant discounts increased $15 million primarily due to a reduction in the accrual for rewards and an increase in volumes.
Mortgage banking income decreased $17 million primarily resulting from lower gains on the net MSR valuation during the current quarter.

Second Quarter 2017 compared to First Quarter 2017
Noninterest expense was $1.7 billion for the second quarter, down $360 million compared to the prior quarter. This decrease was largely a result of the $392 million loss on the extinguishment of $2.9 billion of higher-cost FHLB advances recorded in the prior quarter. In addition, merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $26 million compared to the prior quarter.
Personnel expense increased $31 million, primarily due to an increase of $34 million from higher incentives due to improved performance. Professional services expense increased $16 million compared to the prior quarter and outside IT expense decreased $10 million; both of which were primarily due to expenses related to BSA/AML efforts. Other expense increased $16 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to higher operating charge-offs, charitable donations and employee travel. 
Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $26 million compared to the prior quarter. The decrease largely relates to the write-off of certain capitalized costs on software never placed in service and the writedown of real estate in connection with restructuring activities, both of which were recorded in the prior quarter.
Second Quarter 2017 compared to Second Quarter 2016
Noninterest expense for the second quarter of 2017 was down $55 million compared to the earlier quarter. This decrease was driven by lower merger-related and restructuring charges in the current year.
Personnel expense was essentially flat. Salaries and incentives expense was higher by $20 million, which was mostly offset by a decrease of $17 million in employee benefits expense. The decrease in employee benefits expense was related to certain post-employment benefits, which is largely offset in other income.
Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $82 million, primarily the result of acquisitions and restructuring activities in the earlier quarter.
Professional services expense increased $12 million compared to the earlier quarter due to an increase in BSA/AML related services.
Regulatory charges were up $4 million primarily due to a $21 million FDIC insurance premium surcharge, which was partially offset by a lower assessment rate.

Excluding planned runoff from sales finance loans, residential mortgage loans and PCI loans, average loans held for investment increased $1.9 billion, or an annualized 7.5 percent compared to the prior quarter.
Average commercial and industrial loans increased $781 million due to growth from the Financial Services and Community Banking segments, as well as seasonal growth from mortgage warehouse lending. In addition, average CRE-income producing properties increased $262 million. Average other lending subsidiaries loans increased $717 million, which includes an increase due to the purchase of a near-prime automobile portfolio late in the first quarter with the remaining increase due to seasonality and strong growth in small ticket consumer finance, commercial mortgage lending and premium finance.
Average sales finance loans decreased $446 million, as we are strategically optimizing the size of this portfolio and directing investments towards higher-yielding assets. In addition, average residential mortgage loans decreased $309 million as all conforming loans continue to be sold in the secondary market.

During the second quarter of 2017, a change was made in the method for allocation of capital to the operating segments impacting both the allocated balances and funding credit. Results for prior periods have been revised to reflect the new allocations.
Second Quarter 2017 compared to First Quarter 2017
Community Banking
Community Banking serves individual and business clients by offering a variety of loan and deposit products and other financial services. The segment is primarily responsible for acquiring and servicing client relationships.
Community Banking net income was $345 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $5 million compared to the prior quarter. Segment net interest income increased $32 million due to improved funding spreads on deposits, loan and deposit growth and one additional day in the current quarter. Noninterest income increased $28 million with increases across all categories and primarily driven by higher bankcard fees and merchant discounts due in part to a reduction in the accrual for rewards as well as increased service charges on deposits.
The allocated provision for credit losses increased $38 million primarily due to an increase in loss estimates, higher net charge-offs and loan growth. Noninterest expense increased $22 million driven by higher operating charge-offs, personnel expense and donations and contributions expense.
Residential Mortgage Banking
Residential Mortgage Banking originates and purchases mortgage loans to either hold for investment or sell to third-parties. BB&T generally retains the servicing rights to loans sold. Mortgage products include fixed and adjustable-rate government guaranteed and conventional loans used for the purpose of constructing, purchasing or refinancing residential properties. Substantially all of the properties are owner-occupied. Residential Mortgage Banking also includes Mortgage Warehouse Lending which provides short-term lending solutions to finance first-lien residential mortgages held-for-sale by independent mortgage companies.
Residential Mortgage Banking net income was $46 million for the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of $8 million compared to the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily due to higher personnel expense, loan processing expense and allocated provision for credit losses.
During the second quarter of 2017, residential mortgage loans totaling $300 million were sold, which included $40 million of nonaccrual loans and $199 million of performing TDRs.
Dealer Financial Services
Dealer Financial Services originates loans to consumers for the purchase of automobiles. These loans are originated on an indirect basis through approved franchised and independent automobile dealers throughout BB&T's market area through BB&T Dealer Finance, and on a national basis through Regional Acceptance Corporation. Dealer Financial Services also originates loans for the purchase of recreational and marine vehicles. In conjunction with Community Banking, Dealer Financial Services provides financing and servicing to dealers for their inventories in Community Banking's footprint.
Dealer Financial Services net income was $38 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $9 million compared to the prior quarter. Results were primarily driven by a $14 million decrease in the allocated provision for credit losses, which was largely the result of seasonally lower net charge-offs in the Regional Acceptance loan portfolio.
Dealer Financial Services average loans held for investment decreased $115 million, or 2.9 percent annualized, primarily due to the strategy to optimize the auto portfolio.
Specialized Lending
Specialized Lending consists of businesses that provide specialty finance solutions to commercial and consumer clients including: commercial finance, tax-exempt financing for local governments and special-purpose districts, equipment leasing, full-service commercial mortgage banking, commercial and retail insurance premium finance and small ticket dealer-based financing of equipment for consumers and small businesses.
Specialized Lending net income was $54 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $3 million compared to the prior quarter. This increase was primarily due to a lower allocated provision for credit losses.
Specialized Lending average loans held for investment increased $621 million, or 15.7 percent annualized, primarily due to higher small ticket dealer-based finance, commercial mortgage and insurance premium finance loans.
Insurance Holdings
BB&T's insurance agency / brokerage network is the fifth largest in the United States and in the world. Insurance Holdings provides property and casualty, life and health insurance to businesses and individual clients. It also provides small business and corporate products, such as workers compensation and professional liability, as well as surety coverage and title insurance.
Insurance Holdings net income was $55 million in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $9 million compared to the prior quarter. Noninterest income increased $21 million, driven by seasonally higher property and casualty insurance commissions and other insurance commissions, partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit commissions. This increase was partially offset by higher personnel expense.
Financial Services
Financial Services provides personal trust administration, estate planning, investment counseling, wealth management, asset management, employee benefits services, corporate banking and corporate trust services to individuals, corporations, institutions, foundations and government entities. In addition, Financial Services offers clients a variety of investment services, including discount brokerage services, equities, annuities, mutual funds and government bonds through BB&T Investment Services, Inc. The segment includes BB&T Securities, a full-service brokerage and investment banking firm, and the Corporate Banking Division, which originates and services large corporate relationships, syndicated lending relationships and client derivatives. The segment also includes the company's SBIC private equity investments.
Financial Services net income was $115 million in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $23 million compared to the prior quarter. Noninterest income increased $14 million primarily due to higher investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions as several deals closed this quarter. Segment net interest income increased $12 million due to improved funding spreads on deposits, loan growth and one additional day in the current quarter.
The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $18 million due to a decline in net charge-offs and a decrease in loss estimates related to commercial and industrial loans. Noninterest expense increased $12 million due to higher personnel expense driven by improved production.
Corporate Banking's average loans held for investment increased $327 million, or an annualized 9.1 percent, compared to the prior quarter, while BB&T Wealth's average loans held for investment increased $72 million, or an annualized 18.2 percent. Corporate Banking's average transaction account deposits decreased $69 million, or 11.6 percent on an annualized basis compared to the prior quarter. BB&T Wealth's average transaction account deposits increased $43 million, or 3.8 percent on an annualized basis.
Other, Treasury & Corporate
Net income in Other, Treasury & Corporate can vary due to the changing needs of the Corporation, including the size of the investment portfolio, the need for wholesale funding and income received from derivatives used to hedge the balance sheet.
Other, Treasury & Corporate net income was $21 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $207 million compared to the prior quarter. Segment net interest income decreased $21 million due to an increase in long-term debt, an increase in the net credit for funds provided to other operating segments and a decrease in PCI loans, partially offset by an increase in securities. Noninterest income fell primarily due to lower income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits.
Noninterest expense decreased $408 million due to the first quarter loss of $392 million on the early extinguishment of higher-cost FHLB advances, as well as a decline in merger-related and restructuring charges and lower expense related to assets for certain post-employment benefits, partially offset by higher employee incentive expense and employee insurance expense. The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $20 million primarily due to a provision benefit recorded in the current period for PCI loans. The provision for income taxes increased $179 million due to higher pre-tax income and $35 million of excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation plans in the first quarter.
Second Quarter 2017 compared to Second Quarter 2016
The financial information related to National Penn's operations was included in the Other, Treasury & Corporate segment until the systems conversion, which occurred during July 2016. The majority of National Penn's operations are now included in Community Banking.
Community Banking
Community Banking net income was $345 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $43 million compared to the earlier quarter. Segment net interest income increased $99 million driven by higher funding spreads on deposits as well as loan and deposit growth partially from the acquisition of National Penn. Noninterest income increased $34 million due to higher bankcard fees and merchant discounts, service charges on deposits and checkcard fees, partially driven by the National Penn acquisition. Bankcard and merchant discounts benefited from a reduction in the accrual for rewards and increased transaction volumes.
The allocated provision for credit losses increased $40 million primarily due to an increase in loss estimates related to commercial real estate loans and higher net charge-offs. Noninterest expense increased $22 million, driven by higher personnel expense and occupancy and equipment expense which were primarily attributable to the National Penn acquisition as well as an increase in operating charge-offs. Allocated corporate expense increased largely due to the National Penn acquisition.
Residential Mortgage Banking
Residential Mortgage Banking net income was $46 million for the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of $9 million compared to the earlier quarter. Segment net interest income decreased due to a decline in average loans. Noninterest income decreased primarily due to lower net mortgage servicing income. Noninterest expense decreased due to declines in loan processing expense, personnel expense and operating charge-offs.
Dealer Financial Services
Dealer Financial Services net income was $38 million for the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of $13 million compared to the earlier quarter. This decrease was driven by a $23 million increase in the allocated provision for credit losses, which was primarily due to higher net charge-offs and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses, both due to increased loss severity.
Specialized Lending
Specialized Lending net income was $54 million for the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of $3 million compared to the earlier quarter.
Specialized Lending average loans increased $1.6 billion, or 10.8 percent, primarily due to higher insurance premium finance, equipment finance and commercial mortgage loans.
Insurance Holdings
Insurance Holdings net income was $55 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $13 million compared to the earlier quarter. Noninterest income increased $18 million primarily due to the timing of wholesale commission payments and other commission income.
Financial Services
Financial Services net income was $115 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $30 million compared to the earlier quarter. Segment net interest income increased $16 million, primarily driven by loan and deposit growth and higher funding spreads on deposits, partially offset by lower credit spreads on loans for Corporate Banking. Noninterest income increased $18 million, primarily due to higher trust and investment advisory fees, investment banking and brokerage fees and commissions, and hedge and client derivative income.
The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $23 million due to a decline in loss estimates related to commercial and industrial loans and lower net charge-offs. Allocated corporate expenses rose due to increased investments in business initiatives and additional support area costs. Noninterest expense increased due to higher personnel expense, partially offset by lower merger-related and restructuring charges.
Other, Treasury & Corporate
Other, Treasury & Corporate net income was $21 million in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $26 million compared to the earlier quarter. Segment net interest income decreased $98 million primarily due to the inclusion of National Penn results in the earlier quarter. Noninterest income increased $32 million, driven by a $64 million improvement in FDIC loss share income as a result of terminating the loss share agreements in the third quarter of 2016. This increase was partially offset by a decline in income related to assets for certain post-employment benefits.
Noninterest expense decreased $76 million due to lower merger-related and restructuring charges and personnel expense, both primarily due to the inclusion of National Penn results in the earlier quarter. These decreases were partially offset by higher professional services expense related to BSA/AML efforts. The segment allocated $31 million of additional corporate expenses to other operating segments compared to the earlier quarter. The allocated provision for credit losses decreased primarily due to a provision benefit recorded in the current period for PCI loans.

During the second quarter, the Company completed the sale of residential mortgage loans with a carrying value before allowance for loan losses of $300 million. The sale included $40 million of nonaccrual loans and $199 million of performing TDRs.
Nonperforming assets totaled $690 million at June 30, 2017, down $111 million compared to March 31, 2017. The decrease was driven by a $49 million decline in nonperforming commercial and industrial loans, primarily due to payoffs, sales and writedowns and a $41 million decline in nonperforming residential mortgage loans due to the previously mentioned loan sale. Nonperforming loans and leases represented 0.43 percent of loans and leases held for investment, an improvement of eight basis points compared to March 31, 2017.
Performing TDRs were down $158 million during the second quarter, driven by the previously mentioned loan sale.
Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $493 million at June 30, 2017, down $49 million compared to the prior quarter, primarily due to a decrease in residential mortgage loans. The ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.34 percent at June 30, 2017, compared to 0.38 percent for the prior quarter. Excluding government guaranteed and PCI loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.05 percent at June 30, 2017, a decrease of one basis point compared to the prior quarter.
Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing totaled $874 million at June 30, 2017, up $69 million compared to the prior quarter. This increase was primarily due to seasonality in other lending subsidiaries retail portfolios.
Net charge-offs during the second quarter totaled $132 million, down $16 million compared to the prior quarter. As a percentage of average loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs were 0.37 percent, down five basis points compared to the prior quarter. Net charge-offs for the current quarter include $16 million recorded in connection with the residential mortgage loan sale previously mentioned.
The allowance for loan and lease losses, excluding the allowance for PCI loans, was $1.5 billion, up $14 million compared to the prior quarter. As of June 30, 2017, the total allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.03 percent of loans and leases held for investment, down slightly compared to March 31, 2017.
The allowance for loan and lease losses was 2.43 times nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 2.05 times at March 31, 2017. At June 30, 2017, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 2.80 times annualized net charge-offs, compared to 2.49 times at March 31, 2017.

Capital ratios are preliminary.
This news release contains financial information and performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). BB&T's management uses these "non-GAAP" measures in their analysis of the Corporation's performance and the efficiency of its operations. Management believes these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results with prior periods and demonstrate the effects of significant items in the current period. The company believes a meaningful analysis of its financial performance requires an understanding of the factors underlying that performance. BB&T's management believes investors may find these non-GAAP financial measures useful. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Below is a listing of the types of non-GAAP measures used in this news release:
Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization. These measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. BB&T's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk and believes investors may find them useful in their analysis of the Corporation.
The adjusted efficiency ratio is non-GAAP in that it excludes securities gains (losses), amortization of intangible assets, merger-related and restructuring charges and other selected items. BB&T's management uses this measure in their analysis of the Corporation's performance. BB&T's management believes this measure provides a greater understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of results with prior periods, as well as demonstrates the effects of significant gains and charges.
Core net interest margin is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts net interest margin to exclude the impact of interest income and estimated funding costs associated with loans and securities acquired in the Colonial acquisition and PCI loans acquired from Susquehanna and National Penn. Core net interest margin is also adjusted to remove the purchase accounting marks and related amortization for non-PCI loans, deposits and long-term debt acquired from Susquehanna and National Penn. BB&T's management believes the adjustments to the calculation of net interest margin for certain assets and deposits acquired provide investors with useful information related to the performance of BB&T's earning assets.A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is included in BB&T's Second Quarter 2017 Quarterly Performance Summary, which is available at BBT.com.

competitive pressures among depository and other financial institutions may increase significantly;
legislative, regulatory or accounting changes, including changes resulting from the adoption and implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely affect the businesses in which BB&T is engaged;

adverse changes may occur in the securities markets;

significant litigation and regulatory proceedings could have a material adverse effect on BB&T;
unfavorable resolution of legal proceedings or other claims and regulatory and other governmental investigations or other inquiries could result in negative publicity, protests, fines, penalties, restrictions on BB&T's operations or ability to expand its business and other negative consequences, all of which could cause reputational damage and adversely impact BB&T's financial conditions and results of operations;
risks resulting from the extensive use of models;
risk management measures may not be fully effective;
deposit attrition, customer loss and/or revenue loss following completed mergers/acquisitions may exceed expectations;
higher-than-expected costs related to information technology infrastructure or a failure to successfully implement future system enhancements could adversely impact BB&T's financial condition and results of operations and could result in significant additional costs to BB&T; and
widespread system outages, caused by the failure of critical internal systems or critical services provided by third parties, could adversely impact BB&T's financial condition and results of operations.Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.

History[edit]
BB&T dates back to 1872, when Alpheus Branch and Thomas Jefferson Hadley founded the Branch and Hadley merchant bank in their hometown of Wilson, North Carolina. After many transactions, mostly with local farmers, Branch bought out Hadley's shares in 1887 and renamed the company to Branch and Company, Bankers. Two years later, Branch, his father-in-law Gen. Joshua Barnes, Hadley and three other men, secured a charter from the North Carolina General Assembly to operate the Wilson Banking and Trust Company. After several additional name changes, the company finally settled on the name Branch Banking and Trust Company. Branch remained an active member in the company until his death in 1893. The 1903 Branch Banking and Trust Company Building at Wilson was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[3]
BB&T sold Liberty Bonds during World War I and grew to have more than $4 million in assets by 1923. BB&T Insurance Services was added in 1922 and a mortgage division was added in 1923. Even though banks across the United States failed as a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash, BB&T survived; it was the only one to do so in the town of Wilson.
World War II revived BB&T. BB&T's prosperity continued into the 1960s and 1970s, as mergers and acquisitions grew the company to $343 million in assets with new branches in 35 cities. By 1994, BB&T had become North Carolina's largest bank with more than $10.3 billion in assets and 263 offices in 138 cities in the Carolinas, though it has since slipped to second behind Bank of America.
In 1995, BB&T merged with Southern National Bank, another bank with roots in the eastern part of the state. This gave BB&T 437 branches in 220 cities in the Carolinas and Virginia. The bank continued to expand nationwide through the 1990s, purchasing Fidelity Financial Bankshares,[4] First Financial of Petersburg, Maryland, Maryland Federal Bancorp,[5] and Franklin Bancorporation.[6] In 1998, BB&T acquired MainStreet Financial Corp. of Martinsville, Virginia,[7][8] and Mason-Dixon Bancshares of Westminster, Maryland,[9] and further expanded into Georgia and West Virginia after purchasing First Liberty of Macon, Georgia,[10] and Matewan Bancshares.[11]

In 2005, BB&T acquired Main Street Banks Inc. of metro Atlanta for $622 million.[12] In 2006, BB&T acquired Coastal Federal Bank, based in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[13]
In late 2008, the bank accepted $3.1 billion in bailout money through the sale of preferred shares to the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. In June 2009, the bank agreed to repurchase the shares.[14] Also in June 2009, its chairman, John A. Allison IV delivered a keynote address to a meeting of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, where he claimed to show how government regulation caused the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[15]
On August 14, 2009, the deposits and loan accounts of Colonial Bank were being transferred to BB&T as part of Colonial Bank's receivership by the FDIC. This acquisition added more than 340 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Texas along with approximately $22 billion in assets.[16][17] BB&T sold the Nevada branch to U.S. Bancorp in January 2010.[18]
In 2012, BB&T acquired BankAtlantic, and its $2.1 billion in loans and $3.3 billion in deposits.[19]
On December 18, 2013, BB&T announced the purchase of 21 Citigroup branches in Texas for $36 million, adding $1.2 billion in deposits. After starting with 19 former Colonial branches and adding 41 more locations, BB&T increased its presence in the state to 81 branches with $2.8 billion in deposits, increasing its rank from 38th to 20th.[20]
In 2014, BB&T announced it was buying 41 more Citigroup branches, which added 123 branches and $5.3 billion in deposits.[21]
In 2015, BB&T acquired Bank of Kentucky for $363 million, which added $1.9 billion in assets and gave BB&T a presence in the Northern Kentucky-Cincinnati market, and its first branches in Ohio.[22]
On April 1, 2015, BB&T said it was selling American Coastal Insurance Co. to management of AMRisc LP. BB&T Insurance Holdings also said it would own more of AMRisc.[23]
On April 2, 2015, BB&T subsidiary CRC Insurance Services Inc. said it would buy the strategic assets of Napco LLC, a broker of catastrophic commercial insurance started in 1996.[24]
BB&T completed the $2.5 billion purchase of Susquehanna Bank on August 3, 2015, the bank's first move into Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The acquisition added 240 branches and $18.7 billion in assets.[25]
BB&T completed the acquisition of National Penn for $1.8 billion on April 4, 2016. The acquisition added 124 branches in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland, $9.6 billion in assets, and $6.7 billion in deposits.[26][27]

BB&T has made many donations to organizations operating in its markets and is a major sponsor of Project HOPE.[28]

History[edit]
BB&T dates back to 1872, when Alpheus Branch and Thomas Jefferson Hadley founded the Branch and Hadley merchant bank in their hometown of Wilson, North Carolina. After many transactions, mostly with local farmers, Branch bought out Hadley's shares in 1887 and renamed the company to Branch and Company, Bankers. Two years later, Branch, his father-in-law Gen. Joshua Barnes, Hadley and three other men, secured a charter from the North Carolina General Assembly to operate the Wilson Banking and Trust Company. After several additional name changes, the company finally settled on the name Branch Banking and Trust Company. Branch remained an active member in the company until his death in 1893. The 1903 Branch Banking and Trust Company Building at Wilson was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[3]
BB&T sold Liberty Bonds during World War I and grew to have more than $4 million in assets by 1923. BB&T Insurance Services was added in 1922 and a mortgage division was added in 1923. Even though banks across the United States failed as a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash, BB&T survived; it was the only one to do so in the town of Wilson.
World War II revived BB&T. BB&T's prosperity continued into the 1960s and 1970s, as mergers and acquisitions grew the company to $343 million in assets with new branches in 35 cities. By 1994, BB&T had become North Carolina's largest bank with more than $10.3 billion in assets and 263 offices in 138 cities in the Carolinas, though it has since slipped to second behind Bank of America.
In 1995, BB&T merged with Southern National Bank, another bank with roots in the eastern part of the state. This gave BB&T 437 branches in 220 cities in the Carolinas and Virginia. The bank continued to expand nationwide through the 1990s, purchasing Fidelity Financial Bankshares,[4] First Financial of Petersburg, Maryland, Maryland Federal Bancorp,[5] and Franklin Bancorporation.[6] In 1998, BB&T acquired MainStreet Financial Corp. of Martinsville, Virginia,[7][8] and Mason-Dixon Bancshares of Westminster, Maryland,[9] and further expanded into Georgia and West Virginia after purchasing First Liberty of Macon, Georgia,[10] and Matewan Bancshares.[11]

In 2005, BB&T acquired Main Street Banks Inc. of metro Atlanta for $622 million.[12] In 2006, BB&T acquired Coastal Federal Bank, based in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[13]
In late 2008, the bank accepted $3.1 billion in bailout money through the sale of preferred shares to the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. In June 2009, the bank agreed to repurchase the shares.[14] Also in June 2009, its chairman, John A. Allison IV delivered a keynote address to a meeting of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, where he claimed to show how government regulation caused the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[15]
On August 14, 2009, the deposits and loan accounts of Colonial Bank were being transferred to BB&T as part of Colonial Bank's receivership by the FDIC. This acquisition added more than 340 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Texas along with approximately $22 billion in assets.[16][17] BB&T sold the Nevada branch to U.S. Bancorp in January 2010.[18]
In 2012, BB&T acquired BankAtlantic, and its $2.1 billion in loans and $3.3 billion in deposits.[19]
On December 18, 2013, BB&T announced the purchase of 21 Citigroup branches in Texas for $36 million, adding $1.2 billion in deposits. After starting with 19 former Colonial branches and adding 41 more locations, BB&T increased its presence in the state to 81 branches with $2.8 billion in deposits, increasing its rank from 38th to 20th.[20]
In 2014, BB&T announced it was buying 41 more Citigroup branches, which added 123 branches and $5.3 billion in deposits.[21]
In 2015, BB&T acquired Bank of Kentucky for $363 million, which added $1.9 billion in assets and gave BB&T a presence in the Northern Kentucky-Cincinnati market, and its first branches in Ohio.[22]
On April 1, 2015, BB&T said it was selling American Coastal Insurance Co. to management of AMRisc LP. BB&T Insurance Holdings also said it would own more of AMRisc.[23]
On April 2, 2015, BB&T subsidiary CRC Insurance Services Inc. said it would buy the strategic assets of Napco LLC, a broker of catastrophic commercial insurance started in 1996.[24]
BB&T completed the $2.5 billion purchase of Susquehanna Bank on August 3, 2015, the bank's first move into Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The acquisition added 240 branches and $18.7 billion in assets.[25]
BB&T completed the acquisition of National Penn for $1.8 billion on April 4, 2016. The acquisition added 124 branches in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland, $9.6 billion in assets, and $6.7 billion in deposits.[26][27]
Corporate affairs[edit]
BB&T has made many donations to organizations operating in its markets and is a major sponsor of Project HOPE.[28]

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

History[edit]
BB&T dates back to 1872, when Alpheus Branch and Thomas Jefferson Hadley founded the Branch and Hadley merchant bank in their hometown of Wilson, North Carolina. After many transactions, mostly with local farmers, Branch bought out Hadley's shares in 1887 and renamed the company to Branch and Company, Bankers. Two years later, Branch, his father-in-law Gen. Joshua Barnes, Hadley and three other men, secured a charter from the North Carolina General Assembly to operate the Wilson Banking and Trust Company. After several additional name changes, the company finally settled on the name Branch Banking and Trust Company. Branch remained an active member in the company until his death in 1893. The 1903 Branch Banking and Trust Company Building at Wilson was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[3]
BB&T sold Liberty Bonds during World War I and grew to have more than $4 million in assets by 1923. BB&T Insurance Services was added in 1922 and a mortgage division was added in 1923. Even though banks across the United States failed as a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash, BB&T survived; it was the only one to do so in the town of Wilson.
World War II revived BB&T. BB&T's prosperity continued into the 1960s and 1970s, as mergers and acquisitions grew the company to $343 million in assets with new branches in 35 cities. By 1994, BB&T had become North Carolina's largest bank with more than $10.3 billion in assets and 263 offices in 138 cities in the Carolinas, though it has since slipped to second behind Bank of America.
In 1995, BB&T merged with Southern National Bank, another bank with roots in the eastern part of the state. This gave BB&T 437 branches in 220 cities in the Carolinas and Virginia. The bank continued to expand nationwide through the 1990s, purchasing Fidelity Financial Bankshares,[4] First Financial of Petersburg, Maryland, Maryland Federal Bancorp,[5] and Franklin Bancorporation.[6] In 1998, BB&T acquired MainStreet Financial Corp. of Martinsville, Virginia,[7][8] and Mason-Dixon Bancshares of Westminster, Maryland,[9] and further expanded into Georgia and West Virginia after purchasing First Liberty of Macon, Georgia,[10] and Matewan Bancshares.[11]

In 2005, BB&T acquired Main Street Banks Inc. of metro Atlanta for $622 million.[12] In 2006, BB&T acquired Coastal Federal Bank, based in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[13]
In late 2008, the bank accepted $3.1 billion in bailout money through the sale of preferred shares to the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. In June 2009, the bank agreed to repurchase the shares.[14] Also in June 2009, its chairman, John A. Allison IV delivered a keynote address to a meeting of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, where he claimed to show how government regulation caused the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[15]
On August 14, 2009, the deposits and loan accounts of Colonial Bank were being transferred to BB&T as part of Colonial Bank's receivership by the FDIC. This acquisition added more than 340 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Texas along with approximately $22 billion in assets.[16][17] BB&T sold the Nevada branch to U.S. Bancorp in January 2010.[18]
In 2012, BB&T acquired BankAtlantic, and its $2.1 billion in loans and $3.3 billion in deposits.[19]
On December 18, 2013, BB&T announced the purchase of 21 Citigroup branches in Texas for $36 million, adding $1.2 billion in deposits. After starting with 19 former Colonial branches and adding 41 more locations, BB&T increased its presence in the state to 81 branches with $2.8 billion in deposits, increasing its rank from 38th to 20th.[20]
In 2014, BB&T announced it was buying 41 more Citigroup branches, which added 123 branches and $5.3 billion in deposits.[21]
In 2015, BB&T acquired Bank of Kentucky for $363 million, which added $1.9 billion in assets and gave BB&T a presence in the Northern Kentucky-Cincinnati market, and its first branches in Ohio.[22]
On April 1, 2015, BB&T said it was selling American Coastal Insurance Co. to management of AMRisc LP. BB&T Insurance Holdings also said it would own more of AMRisc.[23]
On April 2, 2015, BB&T subsidiary CRC Insurance Services Inc. said it would buy the strategic assets of Napco LLC, a broker of catastrophic commercial insurance started in 1996.[24]
BB&T completed the $2.5 billion purchase of Susquehanna Bank on August 3, 2015, the bank's first move into Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The acquisition added 240 branches and $18.7 billion in assets.[25]
BB&T completed the acquisition of National Penn for $1.8 billion on April 4, 2016. The acquisition added 124 branches in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland, $9.6 billion in assets, and $6.7 billion in deposits.[26][27]
Corporate affairs[edit]
BB&T has made many donations to organizations operating in its markets and is a major sponsor of Project HOPE.[28]

History[edit]
BB&T dates back to 1872, when Alpheus Branch and Thomas Jefferson Hadley founded the Branch and Hadley merchant bank in their hometown of Wilson, North Carolina. After many transactions, mostly with local farmers, Branch bought out Hadley's shares in 1887 and renamed the company to Branch and Company, Bankers. Two years later, Branch, his father-in-law Gen. Joshua Barnes, Hadley and three other men, secured a charter from the North Carolina General Assembly to operate the Wilson Banking and Trust Company. After several additional name changes, the company finally settled on the name Branch Banking and Trust Company. Branch remained an active member in the company until his death in 1893. The 1903 Branch Banking and Trust Company Building at Wilson was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[3]
BB&T sold Liberty Bonds during World War I and grew to have more than $4 million in assets by 1923. BB&T Insurance Services was added in 1922 and a mortgage division was added in 1923. Even though banks across the United States failed as a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash, BB&T survived; it was the only one to do so in the town of Wilson.
World War II revived BB&T. BB&T's prosperity continued into the 1960s and 1970s, as mergers and acquisitions grew the company to $343 million in assets with new branches in 35 cities. By 1994, BB&T had become North Carolina's largest bank with more than $10.3 billion in assets and 263 offices in 138 cities in the Carolinas, though it has since slipped to second behind Bank of America.
In 1995, BB&T merged with Southern National Bank, another bank with roots in the eastern part of the state. This gave BB&T 437 branches in 220 cities in the Carolinas and Virginia. The bank continued to expand nationwide through the 1990s, purchasing Fidelity Financial Bankshares,[4] First Financial of Petersburg, Maryland, Maryland Federal Bancorp,[5] and Franklin Bancorporation.[6] In 1998, BB&T acquired MainStreet Financial Corp. of Martinsville, Virginia,[7][8] and Mason-Dixon Bancshares of Westminster, Maryland,[9] and further expanded into Georgia and West Virginia after purchasing First Liberty of Macon, Georgia,[10] and Matewan Bancshares.[11]

In 2005, BB&T acquired Main Street Banks Inc. of metro Atlanta for $622 million.[12] In 2006, BB&T acquired Coastal Federal Bank, based in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[13]
In late 2008, the bank accepted $3.1 billion in bailout money through the sale of preferred shares to the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. In June 2009, the bank agreed to repurchase the shares.[14] Also in June 2009, its chairman, John A. Allison IV delivered a keynote address to a meeting of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, where he claimed to show how government regulation caused the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[15]
On August 14, 2009, the deposits and loan accounts of Colonial Bank were being transferred to BB&T as part of Colonial Bank's receivership by the FDIC. This acquisition added more than 340 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Texas along with approximately $22 billion in assets.[16][17] BB&T sold the Nevada branch to U.S. Bancorp in January 2010.[18]
In 2012, BB&T acquired BankAtlantic, and its $2.1 billion in loans and $3.3 billion in deposits.[19]
On December 18, 2013, BB&T announced the purchase of 21 Citigroup branches in Texas for $36 million, adding $1.2 billion in deposits. After starting with 19 former Colonial branches and adding 41 more locations, BB&T increased its presence in the state to 81 branches with $2.8 billion in deposits, increasing its rank from 38th to 20th.[20]
In 2014, BB&T announced it was buying 41 more Citigroup branches, which added 123 branches and $5.3 billion in deposits.[21]
In 2015, BB&T acquired Bank of Kentucky for $363 million, which added $1.9 billion in assets and gave BB&T a presence in the Northern Kentucky-Cincinnati market, and its first branches in Ohio.[22]
On April 1, 2015, BB&T said it was selling American Coastal Insurance Co. to management of AMRisc LP. BB&T Insurance Holdings also said it would own more of AMRisc.[23]
On April 2, 2015, BB&T subsidiary CRC Insurance Services Inc. said it would buy the strategic assets of Napco LLC, a broker of catastrophic commercial insurance started in 1996.[24]
BB&T completed the $2.5 billion purchase of Susquehanna Bank on August 3, 2015, the bank's first move into Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The acquisition added 240 branches and $18.7 billion in assets.[25]
BB&T completed the acquisition of National Penn for $1.8 billion on April 4, 2016. The acquisition added 124 branches in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland, $9.6 billion in assets, and $6.7 billion in deposits.[26][27]
Corporate affairs[edit]
BB&T has made many donations to organizations operating in its markets and is a major sponsor of Project HOPE.[28]

History[edit]
BB&T dates back to 1872, when Alpheus Branch and Thomas Jefferson Hadley founded the Branch and Hadley merchant bank in their hometown of Wilson, North Carolina. After many transactions, mostly with local farmers, Branch bought out Hadley's shares in 1887 and renamed the company to Branch and Company, Bankers. Two years later, Branch, his father-in-law Gen. Joshua Barnes, Hadley and three other men, secured a charter from the North Carolina General Assembly to operate the Wilson Banking and Trust Company. After several additional name changes, the company finally settled on the name Branch Banking and Trust Company. Branch remained an active member in the company until his death in 1893. The 1903 Branch Banking and Trust Company Building at Wilson was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.[3]
BB&T sold Liberty Bonds during World War I and grew to have more than $4 million in assets by 1923. BB&T Insurance Services was added in 1922 and a mortgage division was added in 1923. Even though banks across the United States failed as a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash, BB&T survived; it was the only one to do so in the town of Wilson.
World War II revived BB&T. BB&T's prosperity continued into the 1960s and 1970s, as mergers and acquisitions grew the company to $343 million in assets with new branches in 35 cities. By 1994, BB&T had become North Carolina's largest bank with more than $10.3 billion in assets and 263 offices in 138 cities in the Carolinas, though it has since slipped to second behind Bank of America.
In 1995, BB&T merged with Southern National Bank, another bank with roots in the eastern part of the state. This gave BB&T 437 branches in 220 cities in the Carolinas and Virginia. The bank continued to expand nationwide through the 1990s, purchasing Fidelity Financial Bankshares,[4] First Financial of Petersburg, Maryland, Maryland Federal Bancorp,[5] and Franklin Bancorporation.[6] In 1998, BB&T acquired MainStreet Financial Corp. of Martinsville, Virginia,[7][8] and Mason-Dixon Bancshares of Westminster, Maryland,[9] and further expanded into Georgia and West Virginia after purchasing First Liberty of Macon, Georgia,[10] and Matewan Bancshares.[11]

In 2005, BB&T acquired Main Street Banks Inc. of metro Atlanta for $622 million.[12] In 2006, BB&T acquired Coastal Federal Bank, based in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[13]
In late 2008, the bank accepted $3.1 billion in bailout money through the sale of preferred shares to the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. In June 2009, the bank agreed to repurchase the shares.[14] Also in June 2009, its chairman, John A. Allison IV delivered a keynote address to a meeting of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, where he claimed to show how government regulation caused the financial crisis of 2007–2008.[15]
On August 14, 2009, the deposits and loan accounts of Colonial Bank were being transferred to BB&T as part of Colonial Bank's receivership by the FDIC. This acquisition added more than 340 branches in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Nevada and Texas along with approximately $22 billion in assets.[16][17] BB&T sold the Nevada branch to U.S. Bancorp in January 2010.[18]
In 2012, BB&T acquired BankAtlantic, and its $2.1 billion in loans and $3.3 billion in deposits.[19]
On December 18, 2013, BB&T announced the purchase of 21 Citigroup branches in Texas for $36 million, adding $1.2 billion in deposits. After starting with 19 former Colonial branches and adding 41 more locations, BB&T increased its presence in the state to 81 branches with $2.8 billion in deposits, increasing its rank from 38th to 20th.[20]
In 2014, BB&T announced it was buying 41 more Citigroup branches, which added 123 branches and $5.3 billion in deposits.[21]
In 2015, BB&T acquired Bank of Kentucky for $363 million, which added $1.9 billion in assets and gave BB&T a presence in the Northern Kentucky-Cincinnati market, and its first branches in Ohio.[22]
On April 1, 2015, BB&T said it was selling American Coastal Insurance Co. to management of AMRisc LP. BB&T Insurance Holdings also said it would own more of AMRisc.[23]
On April 2, 2015, BB&T subsidiary CRC Insurance Services Inc. said it would buy the strategic assets of Napco LLC, a broker of catastrophic commercial insurance started in 1996.[24]
BB&T completed the $2.5 billion purchase of Susquehanna Bank on August 3, 2015, the bank's first move into Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The acquisition added 240 branches and $18.7 billion in assets.[25]
BB&T completed the acquisition of National Penn for $1.8 billion on April 4, 2016. The acquisition added 124 branches in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland, $9.6 billion in assets, and $6.7 billion in deposits.[26][27]
Corporate affairs[edit]
BB&T has made many donations to organizations operating in its markets and is a major sponsor of Project HOPE.[28]
