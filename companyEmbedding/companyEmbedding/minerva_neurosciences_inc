World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

Jeffrey Dunn, MD: Why I Went into Medicine
Jeffrey Dunn once thought science was just memorizing facts. Then, an inspiring teacher offered another viewpoint: Find answers to science’s open questions.

Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are research studies that test or improve ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases. Trials may be designed to study new drugs, surgical procedures or devices, or new ways to use or combine existing options. A clinical trial may give you access to innovative therapies or technologies before they are available anywhere else.



Patients at the Stanford Neuroscience Health Center have access to more than 50 clinical trials, many of them available only at Stanford or very few hospitals in the country. If you would like assistance searching for trials, call 650-498-7425.

WALTHAM, Mass., July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Minerva Neurosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:NERV), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapies to treat central nervous system disorders, today announced the resignation of two members of its board of directors, Michele Ollier and Nico Vandervelpen.  Following the Company's recent public offering and the resultant improvement in its financial position, Dr. Ollier and Mr. Vandervelpen will step down to focus on their private equity activities.

Minerva Neurosciences stock rises 7% on plans to advance schizophrenia drug to late-stage trials
Minerva Neurosciences Inc.  shares rose 6.7% in premarket trade Monday after the company said its schizophrenia drug is expected to start late-stage clinical trials in the second half of this year. The drug, MIN-101, is intended to treat symptoms of the disease that affect an individual's psychosocial functioning, such as decreased motivation, lack of initiative and restricted personal interaction, which are "one of the main sources of burden of illness," the company said. These symptoms persist and worsen over the course of schizophrenia patients' lives, said Minerva Neurosciences President and Chief Executive Remy Luthringer, and no drugs are currently approved to treat them. The phase 3 trial is expected to enroll about 500 patients in Europe and the U.S., and will be designed similarly to the phase 2b trial done last year. Minerva also plans phase 4 development of the drug to expand MIN-101's patient profile, which could  include comparing the rate of psychosis relapses to other drugs, or studying the drug in adolescents at high risk for schizophrenia, the company said. Minerva shares have declined 25.4% over the last three months, compared with a 1.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

Minerva Neurosciences stock rises 7% on plans to advance schizophrenia drug to late-stage trials
Minerva Neurosciences Inc.  shares rose 6.7% in premarket trade Monday after the company said its schizophrenia drug is expected to start late-stage clinical trials in the second half of this year. The drug, MIN-101, is intended to treat symptoms of the disease that affect an individual's psychosocial functioning, such as decreased motivation, lack of initiative and restricted personal interaction, which are "one of the main sources of burden of illness," the company said. These symptoms persist and worsen over the course of schizophrenia patients' lives, said Minerva Neurosciences President and Chief Executive Remy Luthringer, and no drugs are currently approved to treat them. The phase 3 trial is expected to enroll about 500 patients in Europe and the U.S., and will be designed similarly to the phase 2b trial done last year. Minerva also plans phase 4 development of the drug to expand MIN-101's patient profile, which could  include comparing the rate of psychosis relapses to other drugs, or studying the drug in adolescents at high risk for schizophrenia, the company said. Minerva shares have declined 25.4% over the last three months, compared with a 1.8% rise in the S&P 500 .

World's best overall value for natural products!


                        Since 1996, iHerb has made great efforts to enhance your online shopping experience.  Initially, our
                        company promoted the benefits of St. John's Wort; hence the name: iHerb.  We carry one of the
                        largest selections of high-quality natural products at the best overall value.  Consider iHerb your own
                        California-based natural products store!
                    










Top 10 reasons to make iHerb your number one choice!




1. Shop directly and save!

            iHerb.com is one of the world's largest online stores for natural products.
            We have been in business since 1996 and have two distribution centers, based
            in California and Kentucky.
        

            Browse our site and you'll find over 1,200 brands and 35,000 brand name products that you may also find at health food stores and natural
            pharmacies -- with one important difference: Our prices are typically 30 - 40% less. Also, don't forget to check our  Specials page for
            additional discounts on some best-selling products.
        


2. Free or discounted shipping

            Every iHerb order is eligible to receive discounted or free shipping! In general, the more products you add to your cart, the greater the likelihood that you will receive free shipping. In some cases you’ll even find that ordering one product alone may result in free shipping. We encourage you to experiment with different product combinations in order to find the best value, and share your cart with others! iHerb is the world's leader in bringing the best overall value in natural products to its customers.
        


3. Honest customer product reviews

            Unlike retailers that display third-party reviews, all of our reviews are written by iHerb customers. In order to write a review, you must
            have ordered the product from iHerb first. This means you receive honest and candid reviews, thereby helping you make a smarter buying decision.
        


4. Assurance of freshness with expiration dates

            Because we have one of the highest product turnover rates in the industry, iHerb is able to offer you the FRESHEST products possible!
            Our inventory turnover rate averages to 8.1 times per year; among the highest turnover rates, if not the highest, in our industry. This means that iHerb products are on the shelf an average of only 45 days!
        

            Plus, most products we carry have expiration or best-by dates, which can be accessed on the product page. It's like holding the real bottle or package in your hand, as you would in a typical "brick and mortar" store.
        


5. Air-conditioned, super clean warehouses

            iHerb’s distribution centers  are entirely climate-controlled, which protects the products from such conditions as humidity, heat and cold. This level of quality control is employed by iHerb to ensure product effectiveness for the customer.
            In addition, our distribution centers are industry certified by NSF International, earning Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certification.
        


6. Solid personal privacy commitment

            Personal privacy is critically important to us. Since 1996, iHerb has never sold, leased or shared any customer information with third parties. Your personal information remains entirely confidential.
        


7. Enhanced 256-bit encryption with tokenization

            Simply put, we only store the last 4 digits and the expiration date of your credit card, so you can identify what card you are using.
        


8. 24 hour/7 day customer service

            One of the ways iHerb can offer such low prices is by automating the whole ordering process. While our customer service agents don't
            actually take orders, they do offer live  customer support from our California facility, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Pacific Time), Monday - Friday.
            We are also reachable 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, by chat and email to answer questions and resolve issues with your order. Of course,
            nobody's perfect. We may get quite busy at times and we ask for a little patience. We'll do our best to take care of things promptly, efficiently
            and courteously -- this is what our customers deserve!
        


9. Save even more by helping others save!

            As an iHerb customer, share your favorite iHerb products or categories, or even a shopping cart containing multiple products with others via simple Rewards links, and you will save even more!



10. A greener way to shop

            When you shop with us, you're part of a global solution. iHerb uses 100% post-consumer recycled paper for 90% of all shipping boxes. Our bubble wrap is 40% recyclable, and we recycle virtually all packing materials received 
            from manufacturers. All in the interest of a healthier, more sustainable planet!  Read more.

Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are research studies that test or improve ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases. Trials may be designed to study new drugs, surgical procedures or devices, or new ways to use or combine existing options. A clinical trial may give you access to innovative therapies or technologies before they are available anywhere else.



Patients at the Stanford Neuroscience Health Center have access to more than 50 clinical trials, many of them available only at Stanford or very few hospitals in the country. If you would like assistance searching for trials, call 650-498-7425.
