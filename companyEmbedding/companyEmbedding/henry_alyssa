Business Insider
In honor of National Engineers Week (February 19-25), we bring you our annual shout-out to the most powerful women engineers in US tech.
Yes, the tech industry is doing a well-documented terrible job of attracting women into engineering. And once they enter this male-dominated world, some women are subject to some appalling sexism and sexual harassment.
But that tells only part of the story. There are women who are leading important tech teams at important companies. And there are women who are building cool cutting-edge technologies at startups.
In other words, there are women having fabulous careers as engineers, building the technology that millions of people use on a daily basis. With that in mind, here are 43 powerful American women who are developers, designers, engineering directors, bio scientists, nuclear scientists, and rocket scientists.

She's the former SVP Product & Technology for Ticketmaster Europe, having landed there after it bought the startup she co-founded back in 1997, Evite. She was the vice president of engineering at Evite.
Gixo is still in stealth but many people in the Valley already expect good things from it, thanks to Tobaccowala.





No. 42: LinkedIn's Kamilah Taylor
Kamilah TaylorLinkedIn
Kamilah Taylor is a senior software engineer at LinkedIn (which was recently acquired by Microsoft).
She's been involved in all sorts of major projects at LinkedIn, including the rewrite of LinkedIn’s major app, messaging, as well as infrastructure, and the LinkedIn Learning iOS app.
But she's probably best known for her work in advocating for women and people of color in the tech industry. She's the author of "Women in Tech: Take Your Career to the Next Level with Practical Advice and Inspiring Stories", she volunteers her time for a bunch of organizations like BlackGirlsCode, she organized the Tech Beach Retreat in Jamaica and she speaks at conferences.

Casey Edgeton is the senior product designer at up-and-coming health care startup Forward.
Forward is the much-watched concierge medical practice in San Francisco founded by former Alphabet exec Adrian Aoun and backed by a who's who in tech (Marc Benioff, Eric Schmidt, Aaron Levie, Joe Lonsdale).
Forward wants to reinvent health care by giving patients a private doctor and an artificially intelligent app that makes use of health tech from body scans to DNA tests. Plus, it charges a flat fee of $149/month and doesn't bill insurance companies.
Edgeton is the woman running the design team at Forward. She's also one Uber's first designers who helped develop the interface for its app. 
 
 
 
 





No. 40: Tesla's Julia Collignon

But she was soon brought in as a project manager for its Powerpack product when Southern California Edison wanted the project done in a mere three months. She led the engineering procurement and construction.
Powerpack is Tesla's push into expanding beyond the car industry, into renewable energy. It involves integrating stacks of Tesla batteries into the power grid. The batteries ingest electricity during the day, when solar sources are high and spit it out at night, when demand spikes.
It reduces reliance on fossil fuels and is an alternative to nuclear power.

Henry, Alyssa, and the Perfect Classic Solitaire Engagement Ring 
By Liza Connolly on May 30, 2014 in Everything Weddings, Jabel Stories 

 

Henry and Alyssa met at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst where Alyssa attended college with one of Henry’s best friends.  Alyssa lived in a house with Henry’s friend where the housemates threw awesome parties all the time, some of which were attended by Henry, though he went to school at Trinity College in Connecticut.  Henry and Alyssa barely noticed each other at these parties.  Each has approximately one memory of each other:
“He’s cute, but he totally knows he’s cute.  That’s annoying.” – Alyssa
“Why is that girl wearing a hemp necklace?  She must be some sort of hippie.  Weird.” – Henry

Love was not in the air.  Also, for the record, hemp necklaces were totally in in 2002.  Anyways, after graduating in 2003, both Henry and Alyssa ultimately ended up moving to Boston, as did their mutual friend, and many, many other friends.  Throughout their early twenties, while Alyssa attended law school and Henry worked for the Red Sox, they hung out together with their mutual friends on a regular basis and Alyssa grew to realize that Henry is not in fact an egomaniac while Henry discovered that Alyssa is not actually a flower child.  As it turns out, they got along rather well and had a lot in common.  One November evening in 2007, Henry walked Alyssa home from a friend’s party, as he often did.  Instead of the usual “Well, see you later!” at the doorstep of Alyssa’s apartment, Henry revealed that he had romantic feelings for Alyssa and told her all sorts of wonderful things, including that he really thinks they could have a lot of fun together.
He was right.

After six years of traveling, eating, playing, and generally having a fantastic time, the two decided to move in together to the tiniest apartment in South Boston in 2013.  Eight months later, on a regular Thursday in May, Alyssa came home from the gym and the two decided to go for a walk to talk about the prospect of an upcoming London trip.  Clad in her sweaty gym clothes, off Alyssa went with Henry, ready to plead her case for traveling to Europe.  And she plead.  And plead.  The two eventually sat down on a sand dune at the nearby beach while Alyssa continued to make point after point to convince Henry to take this trip.  Fortunately, she required a breath at one point, at which time Henry interjected with “There is something else I think we might want to focus on instead of London…”  Then he got down on one knee, in the sand, and told Alyssa all sorts of wonderful things, culminating in asking her to marry him while presenting her with a stunning exactly-what-she-wanted diamond Jabel classic solitaire engagement ring.  She very, very happily accepted.  While they haven’t picked a date or a venue, they are confident, beyond a doubt, that they are going to have a lot of fun together.

                                Report abuseTranscript of Module 6 Project-Water PollutionModule 6 Project-Water PollutionCircular Flow of the Effects of Water Pollution a) How does this issue affect households and local residents? Water pollution causes water to be unsafe for people to consume and use.  If this water is used people could become ill and medical bills could become costly. b)  How does this issue affect area businesses? Local businesses would be affected because if they use the polluted water it could contaminate their product, especially in the agriculture and fishing industries. This could be very costly because it would set them back in production.c)   How does this issue affect our government at the local, state, and national levels? Government would have to set new regulations and get funding for programs to clean up the pollution. If too many people become ill from the water, measures would need to be take to make sure treatment is available to them and that something is being done to prevent more from becoming ill.d)   How does this issue affect the rest of the world? The rest of the world may put restrictions on U.S. exports that could have been contaminated by the water to prevent their citizens from becoming ill. Governments would have to spend money to clean up pollution that occurs in their country.e)   How does the issue affect resources, goods and services, and finances? Resources could be unusable because of contamination, goods and services could  be recalled or limited in production because of the water pollution, and financially  people could sue businesses or choose not to invest in businesses because of  possible contamination of their products.Factors in Choosing a SolutionWhat are the necessary conditions for any possible solution to work? There has to be substantial proof that there is a safety concern in the community caused by the pollution to create support and necessity for a change. There should also be funds to back up a solution, community support and approval, and a complete plan on how to carry out the solution.Are there budget or labor concerns?  Yes, the solution must be cost effective or it may not get the support of the community.Does the public need to be aware of and support the solution? Yes because without the support and help of the community, it will be much harder to carry out any sort of solution. With the communities help, solutions can be carried out more effectively and on a much grander scale.What challenges are there to implementing each solution?  The resources must be available, it can’t violate and local government laws and policies, and it has to have support of the people.How else might you judge possible solutions against each other? I may consider how long the solution will take or how many parts are involved in executing each solution.What do your parents say about the issue? Water is necessary for life and plans should be made to protect it. Everyone can do a small part in conserving and stopping water pollution.Should possible externalities factor into the chosen solution? Yes because if there are more negative externalities than positive externalities, the solution should probably be reconsidered and revised.Possible Solutions and Externalities of the IssueAnalysis of SolutionsIncentives: 1) Individuals would have cleaner water that would not be contaminated by car washing chemicals. Businesses, especially car washing businesses, would benefit because they would get more business because many recycle or properly dispose of the water they use. The government would benefit because the tax money they would get back could pay from different programs and the money that would go towards a cleanup program could go somewhere else. 2) Individuals would get to experience cleaner beaches and water as well as being less likely to get sick. Businesses along the beaches would have more customers attracted to them because the beaches would be nicer. The government would benefit because the tax money and the money that would go towards a cleanup program could go towards new programs. 3) Individuals would be less likely to get sick from contaminants in the water and have more naturally grown gardens. Businesses selling organic fertilizer will flourish Externalities: 1) People may petition against the regulations because they can’t afford to pay to have their car washed  or it’s too inconvenient. More people could start car washing businesses because of the increase in demand for them, which would create more jobs. 2) More jobs would be created because some sort of group or program would need to be created to maintain and distribute the trash cans. Tourism would increase because the beaches would be cleaner. Storms could move or destroy them, spreading trash everywhere that would need to be cleaned up. 3) People who have gardens with specific needs might not be able to properly care for them or have to change their plants. Non organic fertilizer companies would suffer and organic fertilizer companies would flourish.Analysis1) This solution doesn't really meet the criteria as a solution because it would be hard to get the support of a policy like this one and would require money to enforce. It would be possible to ease the people into it gradually but that would take time and they still wouldn't be very happy with it.2) This solution meets the criteria because it's easy enough to get started, it's not as expensive as the other policies, it would provide jobs for those who help with the project, and it would effectively help reduce pollution on the beaches.3) This solution doesn't really meet the criteria because it would be expensive to maintain because many people would have to switch what fertilizer they use and it wouldn't have a lot of support from the people. Without that support it would be harder to enforce the policy.I would choose option 2 over the other options because it is more cost effective and would have greater support from the community. There are less negative externalities for option 2 than the other options which make it a clear choice. Solution 2 would create jobs because they'd need people to place and maintain the trash cans. This solution would effectively reduce pollution, it meets the criteria, and doesn't have many negative externalities, therefore it is the best choice.CitationsWalls-Thumma, Dawn.

Web. 27 Oct. 2013. <http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/gsteps.asp>. Give three possible solutions to the environmental issue you are investigating. Put limits and regulations on at home car and boat washing (1), make trashcans available on the beach and on the islands in the Apollo Beach area to reduce litter (2), or limit the community to only using organic fertilizers (3).Why would some people oppose the solutions you have chosen? Some people would oppose solution one because people may not want to spend the money to pay to get their car washed or to wash their car less frequently. People may be opposed to option 3 because people may not be willing to switch to a different fertilizer What positive or negative externalities does this issue present at each sector of the economy? Refer to your circular-flow diagram. Households-people could get sick from the polluted water and possibly have to pay costly medical bills. Business Firms-If they use the water to grow produce, the produce will become contaminated. Government-The government would have to borrow money to create programs to clean up the pollution and pay workers. Rest of World-Could get sick from U.S. exports of produce and other products. U.S. may import more foreign products because  of contamination of ours. Product market-Could have contaminated goods sold to them which they would not be able to see to the people, or if they did would make people sick. Full transcriptMore presentations by
