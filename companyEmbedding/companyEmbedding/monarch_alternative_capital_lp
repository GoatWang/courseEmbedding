Monarch Alternative Capital Strengthens Position in Europe

		  Opens London Office to Enhance European and International Research and Trading Capabilities and Announces Promotions

						 from   Monarch Alternative Capital LP 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK and LONDON, May 20, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Monarch Alternative Capital LP, a leading distressed debt investment firm based in New York, today announced the opening of an office in London by its subsidiary Monarch Alternative Capital (Europe) LLP to bolster its investment activities in Europe.  
Monarch and its portfolio managers have a long history of involvement in Europe, beginning twenty years ago when they helped pioneer the development of the European distressed debt market. The opening of a London office is an important milestone for Monarch, as it further enhances Monarch's existing European and international research and trading capabilities at a time of increased investment opportunities across Europe.  Monarch's portfolio already includes more than $1 billion of investments outside the United States.
The London office initially will include four investment professionals and may have expanded resources in the future as needed.  Josiah Rotenberg, Managing Principal, and Matthew Glowasky, Principal, have relocated from Monarch's Israeli subsidiary and New York office, respectively, and are the senior professionals in London responsible for research on European investment opportunities. Both Mr. Rotenberg and Mr. Glowasky are currently deeply involved in the firm's European investment activity. 
Joining Mr. Rotenberg and Mr. Glowasky will be Chun Won Yi, who is expected to relocate from the New York office shortly, where he is currently primarily focused on European and international trading. Mr. Yi will continue that role in London.  These three senior and long-standing Monarch employees have a combined 29 years of experience working at Monarch and its affiliates.  The firm also has hired a London-based research analyst, Diogo Vaz da Silva, to support the team.
The London office is located at 52 Conduit Street, London, W1S 2YX. 
Monarch also announced it has made five promotions within the firm.  Michael Maroof, Chief Financial Officer, has been promoted to Managing Principal.  Matthew Glowasky and Roger Schmitz, who both work on the investment team, have been promoted to Principal.  Jordan Rieger, a trader for Monarch, has been promoted to Vice President.  Colin Daniels has been promoted to Associate General Counsel.  
About Monarch Alternative Capital LP Monarch Alternative Capital LP is a private investment firm with approximately $5.5 billion in assets under management. Monarch's investment focus is primarily on the debt of distressed and bankrupt companies and structured credit. Monarch seeks superior risk-adjusted returns through its research-oriented investment strategy, which leverages its investment team's extensive experience in the distressed debt market and long-standing network of relationships.

About Monarch | Monarch LP











 






































Monarch Alternative Capital is an established and recognized distressed debt firm, led by co-founders Michael Weinstock, Andrew Herenstein and Chris Santana.  Established in 2002, the origins of Monarch Alternative Capital date back to 1992 when our co-founders joined together at Lazard Frères & Co. to build an industry-leading distressed debt research effort focused on the United States and Europe.  
Monarch prides itself on the firm’s collaborative and team-based culture.  Our philosophy of hiring at the junior level and promoting from within has enabled our firm to build an experienced and cohesive team that is dedicated to distressed debt investing.  We believe that our one-team model, the strength and experience of our team, and the vast network of relationships cultivated over twenty-five years in the industry are distinguishing competitive advantages for our firm. 
Our flexible and opportunistic approach to investing in the distressed debt asset class and commitment to being active in many of our investments are core to Monarch’s strategy.  Our emphasis on areas with limited competition, particularly in small to mid-sized capital structures, our global mandate, and willingness to take advantage of new opportunities in specialized segments of the distressed debt market are essential to the key tenets of our approach.  
As of April 30, 2017, Monarch manages approximately $4.8 billion in net assets under management and draws on the skills and experience of 67 employees, including 21 investment professionals, across our offices in New York and London.

Investors reportedly seeks stake in Recovery do Brasil Consultoria S.A. from BTG Pactual Group (BOVESPA:BBTG11). BTG Pactual Group has asked interested parties in its stake in Recovery do Brasil Consultoria to deliver their proposals by December 23, 2015, five people with direct knowledge of the situation said. According to one source, as many as 23 firms expressed interest in Recovery do Brasil Consultoria, although no more than half a dozen are expected to submit non-binding offers. Lone Star Funds, Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE:APO), Elliot Management Corp, Oaktree Capital Group, LLC (NYSE:OAK) and KKR & Co. L.P. (NYSE:KKR) are among firms specializing in distressed debt investments that may bid for the 82% stake that BTG Pactual owns in Recovery, said the sources, who requested anonymity because negotiations are under way. BTG Pactual is seeking about BRL 1.7 billion ($439 million) from the sale, should it include the bank's platform that Recovery uses to price loans, two of the sources said. Without that, the sale could earn BRL 800 million for BTG Pactual, the same sources added. Centerbridge Partners, L.P. and Monarch Alternative Capital LP are also eyeing the asset and may submit a proposal, the second source noted. The results of the first round will define how fast the divestment will occur, the sources said. An unidentified Sao Paulo-based distressed debt company, which is teaming up with undisclosed partners to explore the purchase of Recovery's bad debt portfolio or collection platform, has also entered talks and is considering bidding, said the first source. BTG Pactual declined to comment. Interested parties have done some due diligence work on Recovery's portfolio and platform, the sources said. Apollo, Elliot, Oaktree, Centerbridge and Monarch did not have an immediate comment. A representative for Lone Star declined to comment. Credit Suisse Group AG (SWX:CSGN) is in talks to buy part of BTG Pactual Group's BRL 22 billion credit portfolio, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. No agreement has been made and a deal might not be reached, the person said, asking not to be identified discussing private negotiations. Officials at BTG and Credit Suisse declined to comment on the talks. BTG is shopping its loans to large corporations after the November 25, 2015, arrest of its founder, Andre Esteves, forced BTG Pactual into a life-or-death struggle to sell assets and raise cash. BTG’s total loan portfolio was BRL 43 billion at the end of the third quarter, though half are guarantees that can’t be sold, another person said.

Monarch Alternative Capital Strengthens Position in Europe

		  Opens London Office to Enhance European and International Research and Trading Capabilities and Announces Promotions
		

May 20, 2013, 11:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Monarch Alternative Capital LP 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK and LONDON, May 20, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Monarch Alternative Capital LP, a leading distressed debt investment firm based in New York, today announced the opening of an office in London by its subsidiary Monarch Alternative Capital (Europe) LLP to bolster its investment activities in Europe.  
Monarch and its portfolio managers have a long history of involvement in Europe, beginning twenty years ago when they helped pioneer the development of the European distressed debt market. The opening of a London office is an important milestone for Monarch, as it further enhances Monarch's existing European and international research and trading capabilities at a time of increased investment opportunities across Europe.  Monarch's portfolio already includes more than $1 billion of investments outside the United States.
The London office initially will include four investment professionals and may have expanded resources in the future as needed.  Josiah Rotenberg, Managing Principal, and Matthew Glowasky, Principal, have relocated from Monarch's Israeli subsidiary and New York office, respectively, and are the senior professionals in London responsible for research on European investment opportunities. Both Mr. Rotenberg and Mr. Glowasky are currently deeply involved in the firm's European investment activity. 
Joining Mr. Rotenberg and Mr. Glowasky will be Chun Won Yi, who is expected to relocate from the New York office shortly, where he is currently primarily focused on European and international trading. Mr. Yi will continue that role in London.  These three senior and long-standing Monarch employees have a combined 29 years of experience working at Monarch and its affiliates.  The firm also has hired a London-based research analyst, Diogo Vaz da Silva, to support the team.
The London office is located at 52 Conduit Street, London, W1S 2YX. 
Monarch also announced it has made five promotions within the firm.  Michael Maroof, Chief Financial Officer, has been promoted to Managing Principal.  Matthew Glowasky and Roger Schmitz, who both work on the investment team, have been promoted to Principal.  Jordan Rieger, a trader for Monarch, has been promoted to Vice President.  Colin Daniels has been promoted to Associate General Counsel.  
About Monarch Alternative Capital LP Monarch Alternative Capital LP is a private investment firm with approximately $5.5 billion in assets under management. Monarch's investment focus is primarily on the debt of distressed and bankrupt companies and structured credit. Monarch seeks superior risk-adjusted returns through its research-oriented investment strategy, which leverages its investment team's extensive experience in the distressed debt market and long-standing network of relationships.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
