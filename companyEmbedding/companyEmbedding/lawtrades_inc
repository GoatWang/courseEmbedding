About LawTrades

































 


    
    



        We're a new kind of legal company. Empowering people to pursue their ambitions, and challenge conventions.      Every opportunity begins with a problem. Ours was simple–Law firms were too expensive and slow. We were law students when we realized there should be a less expensive alternative to law firms and more work flexibility for attorneys. Where were the solutions? As it turns out, there was a simple explanation. Big law firms are known for beautiful offices at prime locations which comes at a premium. Naturally, to cover such high overhead, fees rise and clients (like you) get stuck with the bill. Moreover, law firms operate at partnerships--a century old model that creates armies of associates to subsidize overhead and maximize partner profit.      We started LawTrades to build something that makes more sense. By circumventing traditional ideologies, embracing the power of technology, and engaging with customers directly, we are able to provide high quality services at a fraction of the price of traditional law firms. We believe that getting legal help should leave you happy and better informed, with extra cash in your pocket. It’s pretty straight forward; better legal leads to better opportunities.

        Design Patent Lawyers     Let patent lawyers protect the unique shape,look, and form of your product.           Get a Quote  Ask a Legal Question  Talk with Guide  Read Reviews       Acquiring a Design Patent     A design patent lawyer will help you protect the unique shape, look, and form of a product. The design patent does not focus on usefulness and instead focuses on the ornamental design of the invention. If the product has no unique or distinctive shape or appearance at the time it was created then it cannot obtain a design patent. A design patent allows the owner to exclude others from making, using, copying, importing a design substantially similar to the design claimed in the design patent. Design patents are granted for the term of 15 years from the date of issuance (14 years if issued before 12/19/2013) and are not subject to maintenance fees. Like all patents, a design patent application should be filed with the assistance and guidance of a patent attorney because of its complexity.   Get a Quote  Benefits of legal advice Get a better understanding      Design patent lawyers will answer any questions you have regarding your original works. You’ll also have a chance to learn about other forms of IP protection like trademarks, patents, and confidentiality agreements.  You're more likely to be approved      Don’t leave the chance of having your patent rejected. An attorney experienced with the USPTO knows how to thoroughly search and already knows what to include and what not to include, saving you time and money.   You wont waste your time     It can take hours, day, weeks, possibly months to learn patent law. Aside from that - you may still need to hire design patent lawyers to fix any mistakes committed.  FAQ What is required in a design patent application?    The elements of a design patent application should include: (1) the Preamble; (2) a cross-reference to related applications (if any); (3) a statement regarding federally sponsored research or development; (4) a description of the figure(s) of the drawing; (5) a feature description; (6) a single claim; (7) drawings or photographs; (8) an executed oath or declaration; 9) the filing fee, search fee, and examination fee.  Can I submit a provisional application for a design patent?    No. Provisional applications may not be filed for design patents.  Can I apply for a utility patent and a design patent simultaneously?    Yes. While a utility patent protects a the functionality of a product or process, a design patent protects the unique visual elements of such product or process. As a result, design patents are made up of drawings that show the invention and, unlike a utility patent application, contains very little text.  What’s the difference between a design patent and a trademark?    A design patent protects the physical appearance of a product whereas a trademark protects the symbols or words used to identify the product as coming from a particular business.  Is it possible to submit multiple designs in a design patent application?    No. Each application is limited to a single, distinct claim (design). If you intent to submit multiple versions of a design then you can attempt to include them but it’s possible that the USPTO may restrict your application to one version of the design and require additional applications for the other versions.  What kind of designs do not qualify for a design patent?    The following patents cannot receive patent protection: 1) purely functional designs; 2) designs that are intended for items that cannot be seen; 3) designs that have no fixed appearance; and 4) colors of an object.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 12/08/2016
            

                BBB has determined that LawTrades meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
