About Vestin Realty Mortgage II
Vestin Realty Mortgage II ("VRTB") was organized as a corporation on January 3, 2006 by Vestin Fund II, LLC ("Fund II") to succeed to the business of Vestin Fund II, a $500 million mortgage fund established in December 2000. We are not a mutual fund or an investment company within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, nor are we subject to any regulation there under. Fund II merged into VRTB in order to provide liquidity to Fund II's Unit Holders while maintaining the business operations, investment objectives and assets of Fund II. 
To the extent practicable, we distribute our income, consistent with Fund II's practice of distributing all of its net income available for distribution. Distributions will be paid on a regular basis from cash available for distribution (generally equal to cash from operations, other than repayment of mortgage loan principal, less an amount set aside for creation or restoration of reserves). However, the actual amount and timing of any dividends will be determined and declared by our board of directors.
Our board of directors decided to suspend dividends during June 2008. Our board of directors will closely monitor our operating results in order to determine when dividends should be reinstated; however, we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.
We are a publicly traded company, and our shares of common stock are listed on the Nasdaq National Market under the symbol "VRTB".
We invest in loans secured by real estate through deeds of trust or mortgages which are defined in our management agreement as mortgage assets. The loans typically fall into the following categories: raw and unimproved land, acquisition and development, construction, commercial and residential. In addition we invest in, acquire, manage or sell real property and acquire entities involved in the ownership or management of real property.  When making any investment decision, we will take into account the rules and regulations applicable to our company and our investment guidelines.

Vestin Realty Mortgage II Files Form 15
Mar 30 17
Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc. has announced that it has filed a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission to voluntarily deregister its common stock, par value $0.0001 per share under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.


Vestin Realty Mortgage II Announces Intent to Voluntarily Delist and Deregister its Common Stock From Nasdaq 

Mar 8 17
Vestin Realty Mortgage II, Inc. announced that it has notified the Nasdaq Stock Market of its intent to voluntarily delist its common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, and that it intends to voluntarily deregister its common stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and cease filing reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The decision to voluntarily delist and deregister the common stock is a cost savings step that will reduce expenses associated with the Company's Nasdaq listing and compliance with SEC reporting requirements, which include legal, accounting and other administrative fees. The Company's common stock is thinly traded and the Company does not believe the benefits of having its common stock listed and registered outweigh the burden of those annual costs. Management believes that the expense reductions created by delisting and deregistering the Company's shares will benefit the Company and its shareholders, and ultimately will serve to maximize the value of the Company. The Company anticipates that it will file with the SEC a Form 25 relating to the delisting of its common stock on or about March 20, 2017, with the delisting of its common stock to be effective ten days thereafter. Accordingly, the Company expects that the last day of trading of its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market will be on or about March 30, 2017. The filing of the Form 25 and notice to Nasdaq will be undertaken subject to a vote by the Company's stockholders at an annual meeting to be held March 9, 2017, or any postponement or adjournment thereof, on proposals to effect a reverse 1-for-1,000 stock split of the Company's common stock, the cash-out of fractional shares at an amount equal to the greater of  (i) $2.70, which is the 10-day average market price ending on the last trading day prior to the first public disclosure of the reverse stock split proposal, or (ii) the 10-day average market price ending on the last trading day prior the effective date of the reverse stock split. The Company is undertaking the reverse stock split to reduce the number of beneficial stockholders to fewer than 300 so that the Company can deregister its common stock pursuant to applicable Exchange Act rules and, consequently, cease filing reports with the SEC. The record date for the annual meeting was January 17, 2017 and the Company filed a definitive proxy statement with the SEC regarding the proposed reverse stock split on January 17, 2017. On the effective date of the delisting, the Company plans to file a Form 15 to deregister its common shares under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. It will be eligible to delist and deregister because it will have fewer than 300 record holders of its common stock if the reverse stock split is approved by the Company's stockholders and completed as proposed. Upon filing of the Form 15, the Company's obligation to file certain reports with the SEC, including Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, will immediately be suspended. The Company expects that the deregistration of its common stock will become effective 90 days after the date of filing of the Form 15 with the SEC.

Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding.

Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.
