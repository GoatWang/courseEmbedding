Title
Asst. Vice President, Director of Athletics

Brad Edwards became the fifth athletic director in George Mason‚Äôs history on July 1, 2014.

In just two years at Mason, Edwards has led a departmental effort that secured more than $17 million in new revenue and product through fundraising and corporate sponsorship agreements, including a $13.7 million 20-year naming rights partnership with EagleBank. In July 2015, Mason athletics entered a partnership with sports apparel giant adidas worth approximately $2 million in equipment and apparel. Under Edwards‚Äôs leadership, Mason also signed a multi-year, million-dollar agreement with Vivature Sports, a training software and billing solution enhancing Mason‚Äôs commitment to the well-being of the student-athletes.

Providing outstanding athletics facilities is a priority for Edwards, currently in the $1.3 million phase 1 of the baseball stadium renovation. Additionally, the department has begun Phase 1 of the Patriots Basketball Improvement Plan primarily focused on providing a dedicated practice facility for the Patriots basketball teams onto the existing RAC facility and a complete overhaul of the basketball locker rooms in EagleBank Arena.
The Patriots have won five Atlantic 10 Championships and has had extreme success in the classroom the last two years. The Patriots have produced 73 Provost Scholar Athletes (3.75 GPA) and more than 250 A-10 Commissioners Honor Roll awardees have been recognized.¬†

Prior to Mason, Edwards has worked for three college athletic departments. In 2012, he was named athletic director at Jacksonville University where he also served as a member of the TaxSlayer.com Gator Bowl Chairman‚Äôs Club Committee in 2014. In 2009, he joined Newberry College as director of athletics and later served as senior vice president for Intercollegiate Athletics and Institutional Advancement. He began his work in intercollegiate athletics in 1999 after a successful nine-year career in the NFL, joining the University of South Carolina Athletics Department where he ultimately served as senior associate athletics director and chief financial officer.

The North Carolina native has a well-documented past in fundraising. At Jacksonville he assisted in raising a department record of approximately $3 million in new capital gifts for athletic facilities, spearheading the development of a 5,000-seat expansion with a new press box to the football and lacrosse stadium, a new softball office and locker room complex with covered batting cage and a new lacrosse team meeting room.

At his alma mater, the University of South Carolina, he oversaw all financial operations during a time of unprecedented growth, with the annual revenue budget increasing from $28 million to total revenue from all sources of more than $52 million. During his tenure, Edwards played a primary role in the development of more than $170 million in revenue, construction projects and project financing, and subsequently received a letter of commendation from the South Carolina State Treasurer‚Äôs Office for his handling of the department‚Äôs financial and business affairs.

In his three-year tenure at Newberry College as director of athletics, Edwards took on the added responsibility of overseeing the restructuring of the Department of Institutional Advancement, consisting of all the college‚Äôs external affairs in the areas of fundraising, alumni affairs, and communications and marketing. During this time, total giving to the college increased 92 percent over the same period from the previous year.

Edwards has led his departments to athletic and academic success as well. In his two years in Jacksonville, the Dolphins won 13 regular season or conference tournament championships and had five student-athletes achieve All-American recognition, along with five conference Coach of the Year designations. Academically, the Atlantic Sun Conference Female Student-Athlete of the Year award was presented to a student at Jacksonville University. The university also received eight NCAA Public Recognition Awards, and had the highest cumulative program GPA on record with nine teams achieving higher than a 3.2 GPA.

During Edwards‚Äô tenure at Newberry, the athletics program moved up 37 places nationally in the Learfield Directors‚Äô Cup standings, while fielding 21 All-Americans, five academic All-Americans, an individual NCAA National Champion and three individual NCAA National runners-up.

While at South Carolina, he was part of a leadership team that saw the department‚Äôs standing in the Directors‚Äô Cup rise to a program high of #11 nationally. He also played a critical part in strategy formulation, all major coaching hires, new facility design, development and construction; most notably assistance with day-to-day oversight of design and construction of the 18,000-seat Colonial Life Arena, and primary oversight of the 34,000-square-foot Charles Crews Football Facility. Also, he was responsible for all venue concessions and food service, department advertising and multimedia rights, department administrative coordination of the 2001 and 2002 Outback Bowls, executive suites, assisting in securing major financial gifts and many other operational aspects of the University of South Carolina athletic department.

Edwards earned a bachelor‚Äôs degree in business management from the University of South Carolina and a master of arts in education from Michigan State University. He is a graduate of the Harvard Business School‚Äôs Strategic Marketing Management Executive Education Program, as well as the Executive Management and Leadership Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Additionally, Edwards is a graduate of the Sports Management Institute, an academic alliance between the business schools and athletic departments of the Universities of Southern California, Notre Dame, North Carolina-Chapel Hill, Texas-Austin, Michigan and Georgia.

Edwards was a standout athlete for the University of South Carolina Gamecock football team, earning second-team All-American honors after the 1987 season. He went on to play free safety in the NFL for nine seasons after being drafted in the second round of the 1988 draft by the Minnesota Vikings.

He also played with the Washington Redskins and Atlanta Falcons and was a defensive co-captain and runner-up MVP with the Redskins Super Bowl XXVI championship team. He was a USA Today All-Pro, a UPI All-NFC selection, and is a member of South Carolina (statewide) athletic Hall of Fame. In 2016, he was voted by NFL.com, as having had the 36th¬†Best Individual Performance in Super Bowl history.

Edwards grew up in Fayetteville, N.C., and is married to the former Marlana Brown. He has three sons‚ÄîJackson, Thomas and Colton and a daughter, Hastings.

Top critical reviewSee all 3 critical reviews‚Ä∫ 1.0 out of 5 starsBoring and patronizing lecture from an arrogant narcissistByShellyMomon February 4, 2016The therapist spends the majority of the video incessantly monologuing from cue cards. He admits that he believes EVERY child is gifted, which is absurd and makes me question his credentials. He also spends a lot of time reading off extensive laundry lists of characteristics, insisting that these things apply to gifted children, not ADHD, ASD, etc. He once mentions 2e kids as a brief afterthought. He is clearly obsessed with the idea of giftedness at the exclusion of comorbidities, and he dismisses comorbidities such as ADHD and ASD by mentioning them with a hint of disbelief and disgust, as if gifted kids are inherently too high in the human evolutionary scheme to have additional diagnoses. He goes so far as to refer to ASD as a "psychological problem" when in fact, most professionals would categorize it as a developmental disorder, and most Autistic people would refer to it as a personality type. If you're interacting with 2e kids, or if you simply dislike being patronizingly lectured to by an arrogant narcissist, then skip this video.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.1.0 out of 5 starsLook on YouTube for better contentByChristopher M. Rogerson June 3, 2016Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseTerrible. Waste of time and money. Who ever gave this 5 stars is obviously Brad's friend or was paid by him. Most of the video is just him with a DSLR, tripod, and some notes. He just sits in front of the camera and just mindlessly read his notes. You would think by the cover picture that he was going to go to schools and show examples of actual gifted children. Instead he bores you to death with material easily found on the internet. The 2nd half of the video is him interviewing white gifted adults with the conversation feeling kind of pretentious.Also the overall image is overexposed just about the entire time(clearly he made this video himself). Brad if you are going to charge me money for this terrible video maybe you should spend some money on it.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.2.0 out of 5 starsNot helpful beyond 5 minutesByAmazon Customeron February 21, 2014Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseI'll be honest, I only made it through 30 minutes. This is a monologue from Brad Mason at the beginning, followed by interviews with gifted adults. It is not engaging to watch.There are some good points, but they are repeated over and over again. There is also no factual information (research, etc.) beyond the case studies he presents in the interviews.I rented this to preview for a class I was teaching on working with exceptional children....this was not appropriate for that purpose since it is very short on facts.0Comment|

Products










One call to your Acme representative will bring you much more than brick. Acme Brick also carries a full line of other products for your home:
Ceramic tile, marble, granite, and slate.
Create dazzling tile entries, or spice up kitchens, baths, and dens with these natural products. Acme sales offices carry premium tile and selections from Provenza, Ilva, Imola, and other manufacturers. To complete the job, Acme also stocks tile sealers, cleaners, setting materials, and grout.
New flooring options
Ask your Acme representative about hardwood and laminate floors from Shaw. Some showrooms also carry carpet and area rugs.
Exciting fireplace options
Whether you choose a prefab fireplace or build from scratch, Acme has all the equipment you need to assure a successful, trouble-free job.
Options for gracious outdoor living
Turn a yard into an all-purpose family room. Build patios and walkways from  quality clay brick pavers from Acme, Pine Hall, and other manufacturers. But don't stop there. Acme carries all the materials you need to add built-in grills and outdoor kitchen equipment, fireplaces, and fire pits. And to terrace or contour your yard - front or back - Acme offers concrete segmental retaining wall units.
Masonry tools and supplies
Acme Brick sales offices stock concentrated mortar colors from SGS, tested for color permanence and designed for easy use. Select from black, browns, reds, buffs, and many other colors.
Acme carries masonry cleaners such as Sure Klean 600 and Vanatrol. To protect your masonry work, products such as Weather Seal from ProSoCo are available. Many Acme sales offices also offer bagged goods, such as masonry and portland cement, as well as masonry tools.
Attractive glass block accents
Acme sales offices represent the IBP Glass Block Grid System‚Ñ¢, which replaces mortar with a sturdy, attractive, aluminum grid. IBP applications include canopies, showers, skylights, windows, and walls. Designing with light has never been easier.
Many Acme locations also offer GlassWalk‚Ñ¢ glass floor systems from IBP. Based on the same aluminum-grid concept as IBP's glass-block applications, GlassWalk systems use glass pavers, sheets of structural glass, and even glass stair treads to make the most of natural light.
