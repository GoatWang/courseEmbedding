** Registration fee paid with initial Registration Statement.




The Registrant hereby amends this registration statement on such date or
dates as may be necessary to delay its effective date until the Registrant
shall file a further amendment which specifically states that this
registration statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with

Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 or until the registration statement
shall become effective on such date as the Commission, acting pursuant to said

Section 8(a), may determine.









This Prospectus contained herein does not contain all of the information
permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, this
registration statement on Form S-1 for GE Life and Annuity Assurance Company
incorporates by reference the Statement of Additional Information and Part C
contained in the filing of Pre-Effective Amendment No. 1 of the registration
statement on Form N-4 (1933 Act File No. 333- 67902), filed on the same date
as the date of filing of this registration statement, for GE Life & Annuity
Separate Account 4. This information may be obtained free of charge by writing

GE Life & Annuity Separate Account 4
Prospectus For Scheduled Purchase Payment
Variable Deferred Annuity Contract


issued by:



GE Life and Annuity Assurance Company

6610 West Broad Street

Richmond, Virginia 23230


Telephone: 1-(800)-352-9910




This Prospectus gives details about the Contract that you should know before
investing. Please read this Prospectus carefully and keep it for future
reference.


This Prospectus describes a scheduled purchase payment variable deferred
annuity contract (the "Contract") for individuals or groups and certain
qualified and non-qualified retirement plans. GE Life and Annuity Assurance
Company (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") issues the Contract.


The Contract offers you the payment of periodic annuity benefits and the
accumulation of Contract Value. If you satisfy certain conditions, you will
receive lifetime annuity payments of a guaranteed minimum amount (the
"Guaranteed Minimum Income Payments") and the potential to receive more than
the guaranteed minimum amount.


To be eligible to receive Guaranteed Minimum Income Payments, the Contract
requires you to make monthly Scheduled Installments in predetermined amounts.
We must receive these installments by a set date each month. We allocate your
Scheduled Installment to a Subaccount of the Variable Account ("GE Life &
Annuity Separate Account 4") a separate account that invests in shares of the
Total Return Fund of GE Investments Funds, Inc. If we receive your monthly
payment before its Monthly Due Date, we will allocate it to the Guarantee
Account until the due date for that payment. On that Monthly Due Date, we will
transfer the early payment to the Subaccount. If we receive your monthly
payment more than 30 days after its due date, we will require you to pay
interest on that payment (in addition to the monthly billing fee) and make the
payment within one year of its due date to retain your eligibility to receive
Guaranteed Minimum Income Payments.


We anticipate that you will make your monthly payments under the Contract by
submitting monthly Scheduled Purchase Payments. However, we also allow you to
supplement or prepay these monthly Scheduled Purchase Payments. You may do this
by making a lump sum Flexible Purchase Payment of at least a certain amount. We
will allocate these supplemental payments to the Immediate Installment Account,
a non-unitized separate account that we have established ("GE Life & Annuity
Separate Account 6"); amounts allocated to that account will earn a
predetermined rate of interest. Depending on your instructions, we will use
these supplemental payments to either lower the amount of all or some of the
Scheduled Purchase Payments you must make each month or to prepay the amount of
all or some of your remaining Scheduled Installment payments. If you do not
provide transfer instructions when you make a supplemental payment, we will
allocate that payment to our Guarantee Account until we receive your transfer
instructions.


Before your annuity payments begin, you may surrender or take withdrawals from
your Contract. Amounts you surrender or withdraw are subject to a surrender or
access charge we assess; amounts you surrender or withdraw from the Immediate
Installment Account may also be subject to a Market Value Adjustment. You must
repay any amount you withdraw from the Variable Account, plus interest, within
one year of the withdrawal to retain your eligibility to receive Guaranteed
Minimum Income Payments.


1





The value of your Contract before annuity payments begin, and the full amount
of your annuity payments (if you lose your eligibility to receive Guaranteed
Minimum Income Payments) afterwards, will depend upon the investment
performance of the Total Return Fund of GE Investment Funds, Inc. You bear the
risk of investment loss.


You should not purchase this Contract unless you believe you can make all
Scheduled Installments and you intend to take your annuity benefits in the form
of monthly income payments.


The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") has not approved or disapproved
these securities, nor has the SEC determined if this Prospectus is truthful or
complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.


This Prospectus does not constitute an offering in any jurisdiction in which
such offering may not be lawfully made.


Your investment in the Contract:


. is Not a deposit of a bank


. is Not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
or any government agency


. is Not available in every state


. is Not guaranteed by us unless you make all monthly Scheduled
Installments in accordance with the Contract and you elect to receive
Monthly Income Payments on the date you scheduled your annuity payments
to begin.


A Statement of Additional Information, dated       , 2002, which contains
additional information about the Contract has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and is incorporated by reference into this Prospectus.
A table of contents for the Statement of Additional Information appears on the
last page of this Prospectus.
