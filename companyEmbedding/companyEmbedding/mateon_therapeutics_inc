                        OXi4503                    



OXi4503 (combretastatin A1-diphosphate or CA1P) is a dual-mechanism vascular disrupting agent (VDA) that is being developed for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Like its structural analog, CA4P (combretastatin A4-phosphate or fosbretabulin), OXi4503 has been observed to compromise the tumor vasculature, resulting in extensive tumor cell death and necrosis while also possibly affecting the cell shape and attachment of hematopoietic stem cells. In addition, once administered via infusion, it forms a highly reactive orthoquinone metabolite, which has been shown in preclinical studies to have antitumor activity. In preclinical studies, OXi4503 demonstrated potent activity in mice that were carriers of the high-risk subtype FLT3 of human AML. These data have been published in the journal Blood.
OXi4503 was studied in an investigator-sponsored Phase 1 study for the treatment of patients with AML or MDS. The open-label, dose-escalating study was sponsored in part by The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s Therapy Acceleration Program, and was conducted by researchers at the University of Florida. The study evaluated the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and biologic activity of OXi4503 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML or MDS. Adverse events attributable to OXi4503 infusion included bone pain, fever, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Hypertension was manageable and plasma LDH and uric acid increased by at least 2-fold within hours after OXi4503 infusions, suggesting leukemia cell destruction. Clinical data from this Phase 1 study were presented in December 2013 at the 55th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition in New Orleans, Louisiana. Results from 11 patients showed that OXi4503 was generally well tolerated with preliminary evidence of disease response (one patient achieved a marrow complete remission).
OXi4503 is currently being investigated in combination with cytarabine in a Phase 1b/2 study for the treatment of patients with AML or MDS. For more information, please go to clinicaltrials.gov.

                        CA4P (Combretastatin A4-phosphate or fosbretabulin)                    



CA4P is our lead investigational drug and is a potent, tubulin-binding vascular disrupting agent (VDA). Compared to other tubulin-binding VDAs, we believe that CA4P has shown the most robust and consistent evidence of tumor blood flow shutdown in clinical trials to date. We are studying CA4P in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (prOC). We are also exploring its potential use in other tumor types, such as neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric cancer. Because its mechanism of action (MOA) is different than any approved drug for the treatment of cancer, its success in the clinic could potentially advance the treatment of many cancers.
CA4P exerts its antitumor effect by targeting tumor blood vessels, ultimately depriving tumors of oxygen and essential nutrients, leading to the death of interior tumor cells, but sparing some cells on the outer rim of the tumor, where the tumor cells are able to derive their nutrients from blood vessels in the proximal normal tissue. This is in contrast to the MOA of currently available anti-angiogenic agents (AAs), which prevents vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-driven angiogenesis, mostly occurring at the rim of tumors. For this reason, combination therapy with agents that inhibit the VEGF pathway of angiogenesis will be the focus of the company’s clinical studies moving forward. Initial clinical data support the therapeutic potential of combining CA4P with AAs in a range of tumor types.




 

                        In Recurrent Ovarian Cancer                    



In combination with bevacizumab (Avastin®)—Results from the GOG-01861 clinical study
Data from the Phase 2 (GOG-0186I) clinical study were published online in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, the official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. This is the first published report of the beneficial effects of combination vascular targeted therapy (VTT) for women with recurrent ovarian cancer. The open-label randomized Phase 2 study was conducted in the United States and enrolled a total of 107 patients at 67 sites. Patients were randomized to receive either CA4P (fosbretabulin) plus bevacizumab (CA4P combination) or bevacizumab alone (control). The Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), a member of NRG Oncology, conducted the study with support from the National Cancer Institute.
The study met its primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for patients receiving the CA4P combination compared to the control (7.3 vs 4.8 months, respectively; Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.69; P=0.05 pre specified one-sided analysis). Preliminary median overall survival (OS) was longer for patients receiving the CA4P combination than for the control (24.6 vs 22.0 months, respectively; HR=0.85; data as of April 2015).
The improvement in PFS for patients receiving the CA4P combination was greater for patients with measurable disease than it was for patients without measurable disease, suggesting, along with the findings of improved PFS in patients with platinum-resistant disease, that CA4P combination therapy is more effective in those with more advanced disease. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) associated with the CA4P combination were relatively low, and no serious AEs were observed. The most common AE associated with CA4P combination was hypertension, occurring in 18 patients (35%) compared to 10 patients (20%) in those receiving control (grade 3 and above).
In combination with pazopanib (Votrient®)
A Phase 1b/2 (PAZOFOS – NCT02055690) clinical study of CA4P in combination with pazopanib, compared to pazopanib alone, in advanced recurrent ovarian cancer. The study is sponsored by The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and coordinated by the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Trials Coordination Unit, or MAHSC-CTU, with additional support from The University of Manchester, the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and Mount Vernon Cancer Centre (part of the East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust). The trial design consists of a Phase 1b dose escalation portion with the combination of pazopanib and CA4P, which was completed at the end of 2015, and a randomized Phase 2 portion comparing pazopanib alone and pazopanib plus CA4P in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer that is expected to initiate enrollment in mid 2016. The study is expected to enroll approximately 128 patients at sites in the United Kingdom. The primary endpoint of the trial is PFS, and secondary endpoints include safety, overall survival, objective response rate, and CA125 response rate. For more information please go to clinicaltrials.gov.



 

                        In Platinum-resistant Ovarian Cancer (prOC):                    



A Phase 2/3 study of CA4P for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. This clinical study, called FOCUS (NCT02641639), will test whether CA4P improves PFS when combined with bevacizumab (Avastin) and physician’s choice chemotherapy (PCC). If the trial is successful, data from FOCUS would be used as the basis for a new drug application to the FDA.
FOCUS is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study divided into 2 parts to maximize the speed of data collection. During part 1 (n=80 patients), several interim analyses will be conducted to initially assess the efficacy and safety of the combination regimen when compared to standard-of-care. Part 2 (n=356 patients) is a confirmatory Phase 3 study which would begin immediately after evidence of safety and efficacy are initially demonstrated in part 1.
FOCUS is designed to build upon data from the GOG-0186I study, which demonstrated that CA4P improves PFS in women with recurrent ovarian cancer when combined with bevacizumab compared to bevacizumab alone. The treatment effect observed in this study was strongest in the subgroup of ovarian cancer patients with platinum-resistant disease. For more information please go to focusclinicalstudy.com.




 

                        In Neuroendocrine Tumors (GI-NETs and PNETs):                    



Gastrointestinal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GI-NETs and PNETs) are highly vascularized tumors that cause a cascade of disease symptoms, resulting in significant morbidity for the patient. Preclinical data have evaluated the efficacy of systemic administration of CA4P for the treatment of functional insulinomas in a transgenic mouse model of PNETs. In the model, treatment with CA4P resulted in a significant and sustained decrease in circulating insulin, with maximum effect seen by day 17 (P<0.0001). Treatment with CA4P disrupted tumor vasculature, induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor cell proliferation, and appeared to be well tolerated, with no obvious toxicity.

Concurrent with the clinical development of CA4P (combretastatin A4-phosphate or fosbretabulin) and OXi4503 (combretastatin A1-diphosphate or CA1P), several preclinical programs are underway that not only seek to broaden the therapeutic potential of our vascular disrupting agent (VDA) program but also investigate 2 new potential classes of agents. Specifically, these preclinical studies include:

Investigating the potential use of CA4P in immuno-oncology in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in preclinical models. This work is being conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Florida and the University of Arhus.
Pursuing the discovery of small-molecule anticancer agents belonging to a benzosuberene class of compounds in collaboration with researchers at Baylor University. These agents are potent inhibitors of tubulin polymerization and are highly cytotoxic against human cancer lines. Preclinical data have noted the relative simplicity of the chemical structure of these agents, which, coupled with their pronounced biological activity in vitro, could enable them to be potent “payloads” in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and to be used as cytotoxic agents in other targeted delivery strategies.
Pursuing small-molecule inhibitors of cysteine protease cathepsins (primarily cathepsin L and K) in collaboration with researchers at the University of Florida and the University of Arhus as potential anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic agents.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. Announces New Interim Preclinical Data on CA4P in Combination with Checkpoint Inhibitors
Jun 28 17
Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. announced that CA4P in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor significantly reduced tumor size in a CT-26 colon cancer animal model. Mateon evaluated its lead investigational drug CA4P, which is also currently being studied in a phase 2/3 clinical trial in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, in a syngeneic mouse model in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor. In order to assess the effects of CA4P on more advanced and difficult-to-treat tumors, tumors in this study were allowed to grow for 13 days prior to treatment. Consequently, beginning tumor sizes were approximately three times larger than those generally evaluated in preclinical studies. CA4P increases the effects of checkpoint inhibitors because it rapidly causes tumor cell death, which likely increases tumor antigen presentation and T-cell activation and the overall immunologic response. These new results reinforce similar results observed in other studies and, importantly, the animals in the combination CA4P and anti-CTLA-4 antibody treatment group are continuing to show declines in tumor volume beyond Day 14. This is the second study and tumor type to demonstrate robust complementary effects when Mateon’s CA4P is provided in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor; results obtained approximately four months ago in a smaller tumor EMT-6 mammary model also showed strong synergy when anti-CTLA-4 antibodies were combined with CA4P.

Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. Provides Update on its Clinical Trial Programs and Milestones
Jun 12 17
Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. provided an update regarding the current status of all clinical trials of its investigational drugs. FOCUS is a phase 2/3 study in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, evaluating whether the addition of CA4P to the current standard-of-care (bevacizumab plus chemotherapy) improves progression-free survival. As of June 9, 2017, FOCUS has enrolled 57 patients in the United States, Germany and Belgium, with enrollment on-going at 37 sites. The second interim analysis, which will occur after the first 40 patients have been treated for at least two months or withdrawn from the study, remains on track to be completed in August 2017. Based on the number of patients enrolled and projected enrollment trends, the company expects the third interim analysis, representing 60 patients, to be completed in late September 2017. OX1222 is a dose-ascending phase 1b/2 clinical trial evaluating OXi4503 in combination with cytarabine in patients with recurrent/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mateon recently completed enrollment and treatment for the fourth cohort of 7.81 mg/m2 of OXi4503, and no dose limiting toxicities or significant safety issues were identified among the three patients. One patient treated in the fourth cohort experienced a significant AML blast reduction, with blast counts going from 89% upon enrollment to 7% following the first cycle of treatment. However, the patient subsequently experienced an unrelated adverse event and withdrew from the study approximately two weeks after the last dose of OXi4503 in the second cycle of treatment, prior to an additional blast measurement and accordingly did not meet the criteria for a complete remission. Three complete remissions were observed in the first three cohorts (19% overall in the clinical trial to date), each of which occurred after two cycles of treatment, and two complete remissions remain on-going at 12+ and 3+ months. Enrollment is on-going in the fifth cohort of 9.76 mg/m2 of OXi4503. The PAZOFOS study is a phase 1b/2 investigator-sponsored study being conducted in the U.K., evaluating the combination of CA4P and the TKI-inhibitor pazopanib for patients with advanced recurrent ovarian cancer. To date, the study has enrolled and treated 20 patients with CA4P and pazopanib in the phase 1b and phase 2 portions of the trial. The study sponsor, The Christie NHS Trust, has temporarily suspended enrollment in the trial in order to collect and review additional information on two recent serious adverse events – one patient in the study experienced hypertension and myocardial ischemia, and a second patient experienced chest pain. In both cases, the events were of short duration and the clinical symptoms resolved. The label for pazopanib, which is not approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer in the U.S., contains warnings for cardiac dysfunction, arterial thrombotic events and hypertension. CA4P has been observed in most patients to cause an acute and transient increase in blood pressure following administration. Following review of the data available for the patients in PAZOFOS, the company does not believe any changes or adjustments to Mateon’s FOCUS study are warranted. FOCUS has restrictive enrollment criteria for patients with pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors and specific algorithms for treatment of patients that experience blood pressure increases. The Markey Cancer Center at the University of Kentucky recently began a phase 1 study evaluating the combination of CA4P and everolimus for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. In the first part of the study, patients are being treated with two different dosing regimens of CA4P in combination with everolimus to evaluate the safety of the drug combination and establish appropriate CA4P dosing levels.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., June  07, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. (OTCQX:MATN), a biopharmaceutical company developing vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) for the treatment of orphan oncology indications, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation to the company’s product candidate OXi4503 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Fast Track designation is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and address unmet medical need. Once an investigational agent receives Fast Track designation, early and frequent communication between the FDA and a drug company is encouraged throughout the entire drug development and review process. The frequency of communication allows potential issues to be resolved quickly and as they arise, often leading to earlier drug approval and access by patients. “The receipt of Fast Track designation from the FDA represents an important milestone for our OXi4503 program and follows promising results, including three complete remissions, from the initial cohorts of our on-going OX1222 study in patients with relapsed/refractory AML,” said William D. Schwieterman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mateon. “This latest development provides further momentum for this groundbreaking study, and occurs in advance of the completion of the fifth patient cohort in OX1222 – which we expect by the end of this year.” About Acute Myeloid Leukemia A devastating form of cancer of the blood and bone marrow, AML is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults and accounts for the greatest number of leukemia deaths in the United States. There is no standard regimen of care for patients who relapse following front-line treatment or have refractory disease. According to the NIH’s National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program, there are an estimated 21,380 new cases and 10,590 deaths expected in 2017 in the United States. AML arises from a clonal hematopoietic stem cell and is characterized by accumulation of malignant myeloblasts in the bone marrow and resulting in ineffective hematopoiesis. AML often responds initially to front-line treatment of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, but it often relapses and long-term disease-free survival is low, posing a significant challenge to treat relapsed and/or refractory disease. About OXi4503 OXi4503 (combretastatin A1-diphosphate or CA1P) is a dual-mechanism vascular disrupting agent. In preclinical and clinical studies, it has been observed to compromise the tumor vasculature, resulting in extensive tumor cell death and necrosis while also possibly affecting the cell shape and attachment of hematopoietic stem cells. OXi4503 is being evaluated for relapsed/refractory AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in combination with cytarabine in OX1222, a phase 1b/2 study. In addition to Fast Track status, OXi4503 has been granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of AML in both the United States and Europe. About Mateon Mateon Therapeutics, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company seeking to realize the full potential of vascular targeted therapy (VTT) in oncology. VTT includes vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) such as the investigational drugs that Mateon is developing, and anti-angiogenic agents (AAs), a number of which are FDA-approved and widely used in cancer treatment. These two approaches have distinct yet complementary mechanisms of action. At Mateon, we believe that we can significantly improve cancer therapy by employing these two complementary approaches simultaneously. When utilized this way, VDAs obstruct existing blood vessels in the tumor leading to significant central tumor cell death while AAs prevent the formation of new tumor blood vessels. Mateon is committed to leveraging our intellectual property and the product development expertise of our highly skilled management team to enable VTT to realize its true potential and to bring much-needed new therapies to cancer patients worldwide. Safe Harbor Statement Certain statements in this news release, including, but not limited to, those concerning the advancement of OXi4503, the results of clinical trials, the potential significance of this data and its relation to other clinical studies are considered "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions Mateon might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: the uncertainties as to the future success of ongoing and planned clinical trials; the unproven safety and efficacy of products under development or that may be developed in the future; and the sufficiency of the Company’s cash resources to conduct and complete its clinical and pre-clinical trials. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed, and actual results may vary materially. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in Mateon’s reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Mateon’s reports on Forms 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K. However, Mateon undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise.CONTACTS
