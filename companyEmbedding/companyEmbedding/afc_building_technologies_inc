Overview































Creating perfect places







					                                         What creates the perfect place?
				





At Siemens, we believe in helping you create a perfect place – perfectly designed for its purpose. A place to learn, a place to develop, a place to grow, a place to succeed.















Your perfect place







					                                                                                                     How do you define the perfect place?
				





The definition of the perfect place is unique to your patients. Your students. Your customers. Each person you provide a place for needs peace of mind to believe that their hospital room is just the right temperature.  That their walk across campus is secure.  That their integrated systems remain operational.  And that their data centers provide the perfect environment for their servers. 

 
The freedom to create the perfect place is critical.


























					
                                        Perfect place to learn
				








At Kent School, officials know they are being trusted to provide more than an education. For parents, the safety, comfort, and security of their children is the top priority. It is a responsibility that Kent School dedicates its full attention and resources to fulfilling.
 
The expansive campus, situated along the historic Appalachian Trail, is one of Kent School’s biggest attractions, but also a challenge when it comes to emergency communication. Discover how  officials at Kent School implemented innovative technologies that have increased safety and emergency preparedness across its campus.











                                    Learn more about Kent School

                                                            Perfect place for medical minds
				








Healthcare organizations in the U.S. spend over $6.5 billion on energy each year, and that amount is increasing to meet rising patient satisfaction needs. Significant savings can be realized by focusing on improving the energy performance of existing equipment.
 
See how El Camino Hospital, ranked as the most technologically advanced hospital in the world in 2014 by Top Master’s in Healthcare Administration, partnered with Siemens to reduce energy costs while embracing new technology that integrates building automation and patient room temperature control drives quality care environments, and improves patient satisfaction.

The Yakima Regional Medical & Cardiac Center’s national rankings, awards, certifications, and accreditations demonstrate the entire team’s desire to deliver excellent care.  
 
To help keep prepared for The Joint Commission, NFPA, or local surveyor visits, Siemens proposed a Fire & Life Safety service program and a Healthcare Accreditation program that allows the center to confidently greet any surveyor – keeping the center’s operations, and more importantly patient care, uninterrupted.

Digitalization







					                                                                                                     How can you create the perfect place?
				





Buildings are alive with information.  Billions of intelligent devices and machines generate massive amounts of data every day, every hour, every second.  And with the right digital tools you can now learn from them and interact with them like never before.  Only when you understand the information available from your buildings can you best determine how to turn them into perfect places.

As a leader in the digital transformation, knowing how to analyze building data enables us to continuously optimize our customers’ building performance – creating real value in their operations and supporting them in creating perfect places.



























					
                                                                                Perfect place for big data
				








Today, everything is based on data – and data centers must deliver speed and scalability to successfully serve as the backbone of entire industries. Learn how the global data center player Digital Realty, together with Siemens, grew their colocation site network by scaling to meet customer needs at unrivaled speeds.

Can your building be more than four walls and a roof? What if it created the perfect place for you, your business and your customers? With an intelligent infrastructure, your building becomes one, continuous source of actionable data. It contributes to improvements, enabling smarter operations and creating the perfect environment for you to focus on the goals that drive your business forward.

Building performance & sustainability







					                                                                                 Something drives us to make buildings better
				





With people spending about 90 percent of their lives indoors, there is no place where we spend more time in our life. So buildings are far more than just four walls. They are the places where we learn the most important lessons in life, where we encounter the personalities that inspire us, where the best of our ideas are born.
 



























					
                                        Perfect place to live
				








The City of Monterey Park, California has begun working toward its green agenda by leveraging both new, energy efficient technologies, as well as an innovative financing arrangement that guarantees energy savings to the City. With LED lighting upgrades, a new building automation system (Siemens Desigo CC™), energy-efficient HVAC technologies, and a new Bluetooth-enabled automatic water meter reading system, Siemens is helping the City of Monterey Park have a positive impact on both the community and the environment. Says Mayor Hans Liang, “It’s not easy for a municipality to commit to spending large amounts of money, even when we’re investing in a more sustainable future. But with Siemens cost-neutral program, we’re guaranteed those energy savings.”

					 One answer against climate change
				






Buildings account for 41 percent of energy consumption worldwide, and produce a third of greenhouse gas emissions. As public opinion calls for more environmental transparency and accountability from public and commercial organizations, improving your buildings’ efficiency is a necessary move. But it is also a smart one: With energy accounting for up to 30 percent of a building's lifecycle cost, performance optimization is a critical step in not just meeting sustainability expectations and emissions reduction targets - but a key lever to improve financial, regulatory and reputational standing.

	PART I








	Item
	1.           Business



	This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These
	statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some
	cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,
	should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates,
	predicts, potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other
	comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known
	and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our
	performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results,
	levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these
	forward-looking statements.


	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the
	forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
	levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by
	applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not
	intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these
	statements to actual results.


	Our consolidated financial statements are stated in United
	States dollars (US$) and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally
	Accepted Accounting Principles.


	In this annual report, unless otherwise specified, all dollar
	amounts are expressed in United States dollars and all references to common
	shares refer to the common shares in our capital stock.


	As used in this current report and unless otherwise indicated,
	the terms we, us and our mean AFC Building Technologies Inc., a company
	incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada, and our former wholly-owned
	subsidiary, DSL Products Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of the
	Province of Ontario.



	General Overview



	We were incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on
	May 10, 2011 under the name Auto Tool Technologies Inc. and have been engaged in
	the distribution of hand tools throughout Canada. Our fiscal year end is
	December 31. We had one subsidiary, DSL Products Limited, a company incorporated
	under the laws of the Province of Ontario, which we acquired via a share
	exchange on December 30, 2011 in exchange for 240,000,000 shares of our common
	stock, and which operates our hand tool distribution business. Our business
	offices are currently located at 101 ½ Mary Street West, Whitby, Ontario,
	Canada, L1N 2R4. The address of agent for service in Nevada and registered
	corporate office is c/o National Registered Agents, Inc. of Nevada, 100 East
	William Street, Suite 204, Carson City, NV, 89701. Our telephone number is (905)
	430-6433.


	On December 19, 2013, our board of directors and a majority
	holder of our companys voting securities approved a change of name of our
	company to AFC Building Technologies Inc.


	In addition to the change of name, our board of directors and a
	majority holder of our company's voting securities approved a 1 old for 8 new
	forward split of our then issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
	pursuant to which our issued and outstanding shares increased from 4,345,001
	shares of common stock to 34,760,008 shares of common stock, our authorized
	capital remains unchanged. All references to common stock have been
	retroactively re-stated.


	A Certificate of Amendment to effect the change of name was
	filed and became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on January 10,
	2014.


	These amendments were reviewed by the Financial Industry
	Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and approved for filing with an effective date of
	January 14, 2014. The forward split and name change became effective with the
	Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on January 14, 2014.
	Our trading symbol is AFCT. Our CUSIP number is 00108E 100.


	Other than as set out in this annual report, we have not been
	involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we
	been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase
	or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our
	business.







	Our Current Business



	On June 30, 2015, we decided that continuing the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited (“DSL”) would no longer be economically feasible. All of the shares of DSL held by us were returned to DSL for cancellation
	and as of June 30, 2015 we no longer held any interest in DSL. Concurrently with the discontinuation of the DSL operations, we entered into a license agreement for an exclusive worldwide license in regards to 15 domain names related to the
	automotive e-commerce business. In consideration for the granting of the license, we will pay to the licensor a royalty of 2.5% of gross sales for any revenue derived from the use of the licensed domains. Consistent with our historical operations in
	this area, we intend to continue to pursue automotive e-commerce opportunities.


	Prior to our decision to discontinue operations, we imported and marketed hand tools, automotive accessories, lawn and garden products, home products, accessories and attachments for power tools, plumbing products, consumer mechanics tools, cargo
	control systems and accessories and fasteners. These products were sold to professional end users, distributors, and consumers, and are primarily distributed through retailers (including auto parts stores, home centers, mass merchants, hardware
	stores, and retail lumber yards).


	Hand tools included measuring and leveling tools, hex key sets, hammers, demolition tools, knives and blades, screwdrivers, saws, chisels, clamps and clamping systems and consumer tackers. Automotive accessories included fuses and fuse sets, o-rings
	sets, specialty tools, tune-up kits, tire repair kits, electrical test kits, jumper cable sets, and mechanic gloves. Home products were comprised of cable ties, scissors, calculators, magnifying glasses, flexible flashlights, paint tools and
	cleaning brushes. Cargo control systems included ratchet tie-down straps, cambuckle sets, tow ropes, bungee cord sets and cargo nets.


	Our products were sold throughout Canada. We contracted the services of a national manufacturer’s agency who call on current and prospective customers. We also sold our products on a wholesale basis via our website at www.toolcachecanada.com,
	which had on-line ordering capability which is secure and individualized to the respective customer.


	Our plan had been to launch www.toolvalley.com as our retail consumer portal. However, we are currently reviewing our business strategy with respect to launching a business to consumer website. Major competitors including eBay and Amazon have
	recently launched major initiatives to sell auto parts and accessories on-line. We are continuing to monitor these developments. In addition, we are also currently reviewing other potential business ventures, in an effort to capitalize on our
	logistics and distribution expertise. We have not been able to raise, sufficient capital to launch our e-commerce business, particularly given these developments in the industry.



	Competition



	We will encounter active competition in all of our businesses from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses via e-commerce. We have a
	large number of competitors; however, aside from a small number of who market a range of products somewhat comparable to us, the majority of our competitors compete only with respect to one or more individual products or product lines in that
	segment. Certain large customers offer private label brands (“house brands”) that compete across a wider spectrum of our DIY segment product offerings.



	Customers



	A significant portion of our products were sold to a wide variety of automotive parts stores and home centers in Canada. A consolidation of retailers both in Canada and abroad has occurred over time. While this consolidation and the domestic and
	international expansion of these large retailers has provided us with opportunities for growth, the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss.


	During the year ended December 31, 2014 we relied on one customer for an aggregate of 30% and 34% of our revenues.



	Suppliers



	We had acquired our product for resale from established manufacturers and hand tool distributors. Almost all of our products were acquired as finished goods that are immediately ready for sale to our customers.







	Intellectual Property



	We had been granted a Canadian trademark registration for Tool
	Valley.



	Serial/File No. 1293373


	Trademark: Tool Valley


	Registration No.: TMA819,674


	Registration date: 12 Mar 2012



	An exclusive worldwide license in regards to 15 domain names

	We have not paid any dividends since our incorporation and do
	not anticipate the payment of dividends in the foreseeable future. At present,

	earnings, capital requirements, and operating financial conditions.

	securities are authorized for issuance.

	Revenue



	We had no revenues in the years ended December 31, 2015 and
	2014, due to the discontinuation of our operations under our subsidiary.



	Cost of Sales



	Cost of sales have been recorded as $0 due to our discontinued
	operations.



	Operating Expenses



	Total operating expenses relating to bank charges, interest,
	selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended
	December 31, 2015 to $22,245 from $33,087 for the year ended December 31, 2014.
	This was due primarily to reductions in selling and marketing expenses and
	primarily as a result of our discontinued operations.


	In the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred net losses of
	$93,629.



	Cash Requirements



	Based on our planned expenditures, we will require
	approximately $30,000 over the next 12 months. In order to provide funds, we
	plan to pursue additional equity financing from private investors or possibly a
	registered public offering. We do not currently have any definitive arrangements
	in place for the completion of any further private placement financings and
	there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any further
	private placement financings. If we are unable to achieve the necessary
	additional financing, then we plan to reduce the amounts that we spend on our
	business activities and administrative expenses in order to be within the amount
	of capital resources that are available to us.


	We have not investigated the availability of commercial loans
	or other debt financing to supplement or meet our cash requirements. In the
	uncertain event that any such debt financing alternatives were available to us
	on acceptable terms, they would increase our liabilities and future cash
	commitments



	Going Concern







	Our consolidated audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 have been prepared on a going concern basis and contain an additional explanatory paragraph which identifies issues that raise substantial doubt about our ability to
	continue as a going concern. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.


	The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders and note holders, the ability of our company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations, and ultimately the
	attainment of profitable operations. As at December 31, 2015, our company has not generated any revenues, has a working capital deficit of $76,161, and has an accumulated deficit of $312,290 since inception. These factors raise substantial
	doubt regarding our company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of
	liabilities that might be necessary should our company be unable to continue as a going concern.



	Critical Accounting Policies



	The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United
	States of America and are expressed in United States dollars. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and
	assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an
	understanding of our financial statements.



	Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation



	The consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and are expressed in US dollars. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
	our company and our previously wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited through June 30, 2015. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Our company’s fiscal year-end is December 31.



	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
	the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to useful life and recoverability of long-lived assets,
	collectability of receivables and related bad debt expenses, inventory shrinkage and write off, deferred income tax asset valuations and loss contingencies. Our company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and
	various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily
	apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by our company may differ materially and adversely from our company’s estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future
	results of operations will be affected.



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	Our company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.



	Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts



	Accounts receivable are stated at the amount billed to customers and are ordinarily due upon receipt. Our company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts, which is based upon a review of outstanding receivables, historical collection information
	and existing economic conditions. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it is deemed probable that the customer will not make the required payments at either the contractual due dates or in the future. At December 31, 2015 and 2014,
	there were no provisions for doubtful accounts necessary.







	Inventory



	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined on a standard cost basis that approximates the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Market is determined based on net realizable value. Appropriate consideration is given to
	obsolescence, excessive levels, deterioration, and other factors in evaluating net realizable value. At December 31, 2015 the company recorded no inventory. At December 31, 2014 the company had $52,049 in inventory consisting of tools and tool
	displays. At December 31, 2014, we had recorded an inventory reserve of $10,476.



	Property and Equipment



	Property and equipment consists of furniture, fixtures and computer equipment and is recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of five years.



	Long Lived Assets



	In accordance with ASC 360,

	Property Plant and Equipment

	our company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances
	which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount
	originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and a current expectation
	that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.


	Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as
	specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.



	Financial Instruments/Concentrations



	Our company’s financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and loan payable. Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and ASC 825, Financial Instruments the fair value of cash
	equivalent is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Our company believes that the recorded values of all of our company’s other financial instruments
	approximate their current fair values because of their nature and relatively short maturity dates or durations.



	Shipping and Freight



	Shipping and freight costs are classified as part of the operating expenses. These costs are considered recurring costs that are incurred in order to generate sales.



	Foreign Currency Translation



	The functional currency of our company is the Canadian dollar and the reporting currency of our company is the United States dollar. The consolidated financial statements of our company were translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC
	830,

	Foreign Currency Translation Matters

	, using period-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for revenues and expenses. Translation gains (losses) are recorded in accumulated other
	comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses arising on foreign currency denominated transactions included in the determination of income. Foreign currency transactions are primarily undertaken in United
	States dollars. Our company has not, to the date of these consolidated financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.



	Comprehensive Income (Loss)



	ASC 220,

	Comprehensive Income

	establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income (loss) and its components in the consolidated financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our
	company’s only component of comprehensive income was foreign currency translation adjustment.







	Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share



	Our company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC
	260,

	Earnings per Share

	. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and
	diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the statement of operations.
	Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common
	shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
	(denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive
	potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
	method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In
	computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in
	determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of
	stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive shares
	if their effect is anti-dilutive. Our company did not have any dilutive
	potential shares outstanding at December 31, 2015 or 2014.



	Discontinued Operations



	The results of discontinued operations are presented
	separately, net of tax, from the results of ongoing operations for all periods
	presented. The expenses included in the results of discontinued operations are
	the direct operating expenses incurred by the disposed components that may be
	reasonably segregated from the costs of the ongoing operations of the Company.
	Assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations are disclosed in Note
	6.



	Income Taxes



	Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in
	the accounts until realization is more likely than not. Our company has adopted
	ASC 740,

	Income Taxes

	as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740 our
	company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses
	carried forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been
	recognized in these consolidated financial statements because our company cannot
	be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses
	carried forward in future years. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our company
	had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.



	Revenue Recognition



	Our company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
	arrangement exists, products have been shipped, the sales price is fixed or
	determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	Our company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements
	that are in effect and that may impact its consolidated financial statements and
	does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that
	have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or
	results of operations.

	stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years then ended.
	AFC Building Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiarys management is responsible for
	these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
	financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
	Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
	whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company
	is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its
	internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of
	internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
	procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
	expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control
	over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also
	includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
	disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
	used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
	overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
	reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
	present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of AFC Building
	Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiary as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the
	results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
	two-year period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
	prepared on the going concern basis. As discussed in Note 7 to the financial
	statements, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue
	as a going concern, which is dependent upon the continued financial support from
	its shareholders and note holders. The financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion
	is not modified with respect to that matter.

	AFC Building Technologies Inc.



	Notes to the Consolidated
	Financial Statements

	December 31, 2015

	(Expressed in US dollars)





	1.



	Nature of Operations





	 


	 







	AFC Building Technologies Inc. (the Company) was
	incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 10, 2011.
	Effective January 10, 2014, the Company changed its name from Auto Tool
	Technologies Inc. to AFC Building Technologies Inc. The Company was
	engaged in the sales and distribution of hand tools in Canada.





	 


	 







	On June 30, 2015, the Company decided that continuing the
	operations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, DSL Products Limited (DSL)
	would no longer be economically feasible. All of the shares of DSL held by
	the Company were returned to DSL for cancellation and as of June 30, 2015
	the Company no longer held any interest in DSL. The Company determined the
	operations of DSL met the criteria of being reported as a discontinued
	operation. As a result, the Companys historical financial statements have
	been revised to present the operating results of the DSL business as a
	discontinued operation. The results of operations from DSL are presented
	as Loss from discontinued operations in the Statements of Operations.
	Unless otherwise noted, the discussion in the notes to these Financial
	Statements relates solely to the Company's continuing operations. The
	Company is in the process of determining a new line of business.





	 


	 







	Going Concern





	 


	 







	These financial statements have been prepared on a going
	concern basis, which implies the Company will continue to realize its
	assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The
	continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the
	continued financial support from its shareholders and note holders, the
	ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue
	operations, and ultimately the attainment of profitable operations. As at
	December 31, 2015, the Company has not generated any revenues, has a
	working capital deficit of $59,301, and has an accumulated deficit of
	$295,430 since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding
	the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed
	financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability
	and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of
	liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
	continue as a going concern.





	 


	 







	Summary of Significant Accounting
	Policies








	 


	a)



	Basis of Presentation and Principles of
	Consolidation





	 


	 


	 




	 





	These consolidated financial statements and related notes
	are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States, and are expressed in US dollars. The Companys
	fiscal year-end is December 31.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	b)



	Use of Estimates





	 


	 


	 




	 





	The preparation of these consolidated financial
	statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
	principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
	affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
	consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
	expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates
	estimates and assumptions related to useful life and recoverability of
	long-lived assets, collectability of receivables and related bad debt
	expenses, inventory shrinkage and write off, deferred income tax asset
	valuations and loss contingencies. The Company bases its estimates and
	assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other
	factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the
	results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
	values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses
	that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results
	experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the
	Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between
	the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be
	affected.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	c)



	Cash and Cash Equivalents





	 


	 


	 




	 





	The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with
	maturities of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash
	equivalents.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	d)



	Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful
	Accounts





	F-6






	AFC Building Technologies Inc.

	Notes to the Consolidated
	Financial Statements

	December 31, 2015

	(Expressed in US dollars)





	 





	Accounts receivable are stated at the amount billed to
	customers and are ordinarily due upon receipt. The Company provides an
	allowance for doubtful accounts, which is based upon a review of
	outstanding receivables, historical collection information and existing
	economic conditions. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it
	is deemed probable that the customer will not make the required payments
	at either the contractual due dates or in the future. At December 31, 2015
	and 2014, there were no provisions for doubtful accounts
	necessary.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	e)



	Inventory





	 


	 


	 




	 





	Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
	Cost is determined on a standard cost basis that approximates the
	first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Market is determined based on net
	realizable value. Appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence,
	excessive levels, deterioration, and other factors in evaluating net
	realizable value. At December 31, 2015, the Company had no inventory. At
	December 31, 2014, the Company had inventory which consisted of tools and
	tool displays, of $52,049 net. At December 31, 2014, the Company had
	recorded an inventory reserve of $10,476 and is included in current assets
	of discontinued operations.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	f)



	Property and Equipment





	 


	 


	 




	 





	Property and equipment consists of furniture, fixtures
	and computer equipment and is recorded at cost. Depreciation is recorded
	on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of five
	years.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	g)



	Long lived assets





	 


	 


	 




	 





	In accordance with ASC 360,

	Property Plant and
	Equipment

	the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for
	recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their
	carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger
	a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the
	market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business
	climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of
	the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the
	asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a
	history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the
	use of the asset; and a current expectation that the asset will more
	likely than not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its
	estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying
	amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based
	on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use
	and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in
	certain instances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying
	amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	h)



	Financial Instruments/Concentrations





	 


	 


	 




	 





	The Companys financial instruments consist principally
	of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and loan payable. Pursuant
	to ASC 820,

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	and ASC 825,

	Financial Instruments

	the fair value of cash equivalents are
	determined based on Level 1 inputs, which consist of quoted prices in
	active markets for identical assets. The Company believes that the
	recorded values of all of the Companys other financial instruments
	approximate their current fair values because of their nature and
	relatively short maturity dates or durations.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	i)



	Shipping and Freight





	 


	 


	 




	 





	Shipping and freight costs are classified as part of the
	operating expenses. These costs are considered recurring costs that are
	incurred in order to generate sales. These expenses were incurred as part
	of the Companys discontinued operations and have been presented as part
	of loss from discontinued operations.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	j)



	Foreign Currency Translation





	 


	 


	 




	 





	The functional currency of the Company is the Canadian
	dollar and the reporting currency of the Company is the United States
	dollar. The consolidated financial statements of the Company were
	translated to United States dollars in accordance with ASC 830,

	Foreign
	Currency Translation Matters

	, using period-end rates of exchange for
	assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the year for
	revenues and expenses. The period-end rate of exchange was $0.7225 and the
	average rate of exchange for the year was $0.7821 Translation gains
	(losses) are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as
	a component of stockholders equity. Gains and losses arising on foreign
	currency denominated transactions included in the determination of income.
	Foreign currency transactions are primarily undertaken in United States
	dollars.





	F-7






	AFC Building Technologies Inc.

	Notes to the Consolidated
	Financial Statements

	December 31, 2015

	(Expressed in US dollars)





	 





	The Company has not, to the date of these consolidated
	financial statements, entered into derivative instruments to offset the
	impact of foreign currency fluctuations.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	k)



	Comprehensive Income (Loss)





	 


	 


	 




	 





	ASC 220,

	Comprehensive Income

	establishes
	standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income (loss) and
	its components in the consolidated financial statements. During the years
	ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Companys only component of
	comprehensive income was foreign currency translation
	adjustments.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	l)



	Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share





	 


	 


	 




	 





	The Company computes net loss per share in accordance
	with ASC 260,

	Earnings per Share

	. ASC 260 requires presentation of
	both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the
	statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income
	(loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted
	average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period.
	Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
	outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and
	convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing
	diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining
	the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock
	options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all potentially dilutive shares
	if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company did not have any dilutive
	potential shares outstanding at December 31, 2015 or 2014.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	m)



	Income Taxes





	 


	 


	 




	 





	Potential benefits of income tax losses are not
	recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The
	Company has adopted ASC 740,

	Income Taxes

	as of its inception.
	Pursuant to ASC 740 the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits
	for net operating losses carried forward. The potential benefits of net
	operating losses have not been recognized in these consolidated financial
	statements because the Company cannot be assured it is more likely than
	not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future
	years. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no accrued
	interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	n)



	Revenue Recognition





	 


	 


	 




	 





	The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence
	of an arrangement exists, products have been shipped, the sales price is
	fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	o)



	Advertising Costs





	 


	 


	 




	 





	The Company expenses the cost of advertising and
	promotional materials when incurred. Total advertising costs were $5,677
	and $7,407 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
	These expenses were incurred as part of the Companys discontinued
	operations and have been presented as part of loss from discontinued
	operations.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	p)



	Discontinued Operations





	 


	 


	 




	 





	The results of discontinued operations are presented
	separately, net of tax, from the results of ongoing operations for all
	periods presented. The expenses included in the results of discontinued
	operations are the direct operating expenses incurred by the disposed
	components that may be reasonably segregated from the costs of the ongoing
	operations of the Company. Assets and liabilities related to discontinued
	operations are disclosed in Note 6. The Company disposed of DSL on June
	30, 2015.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	q)



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements





	 


	 


	 




	 





	The Company has implemented all new accounting
	pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial
	statements. Additionally, the Company has considered all pronouncements
	issued but not yet effective and does not believe that there are any other
	new accounting pronouncements that might have a material impact on its
	financial position or results of operations.

	Related Party Transactions





	 


	 


	 






	a)



	At December 31, 2015, the Company owed $0 (December 31,
	2014 - $322,398) to a company owned by a shareholder of the Company,
	representing cash advances, net of expense reimbursements and
	accrued interest. During December 2015, a company controlled by a
	shareholder agreed to forgive $300,988 of amounts owed by the Company. As
	the debt forgiven was owed to a related party, the Company recognized the
	amount forgiven as an equity transaction recorded in additional paid-in
	capital. The amount was unsecured and due on demand.

	b)



	At December 31, 2015, the Company owed $8,021 (December
	31, 2014 - $7,546) to the President of the Company. These were monies
	advanced by the shareholder for general working capital purposes, (i.e.
	accounting and professional fees) as required. The amount is unsecured,
	non-interest bearing and due on demand.





	 


	 


	 




	 


	c)



	During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company
	incurred $27,640 (2014 - $62,819) of contractor expenses to the President
	of the Company. These expenses were incurred as part of the Companys
	discontinued operations and have been presented as part of loss from
	discontinued operations.

	Discontinued Operations and Deconsolidation of
	Subsidiary





	 


	 







	On June 30, 2015, the Company discontinued the operations
	of its wholly-owned subsidiary DSL. DSL sold hand tools in Canada. All of
	the shares of DSL held by the Company were returned to DSL for
	cancellation and as of June 30, 2015 the Company no longer held any
	interest in DSL. As the subsidiary was distributed to a shareholder, the
	Company recorded the deconsolidation of the subsidiary as an equity
	transaction, which resulted in a charge of $65,068 to additional paid in
	capital. The Company has recognized the separation of DSL in accordance
	with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-20,

	Discontinued

	Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby
	deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences
	and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax
	liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary
	differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and
	liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
	valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely
	than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
	realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects
	of changes in the tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The Company
	recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
	within income tax expense. At December 31, 2015, the Company had net
	operating loss carryforwards of approximately $105,600 that may be offset
	against future taxable income from the year 2015 through 2030. This
	results in a deferred tax asset of $35,911 as of December 31, 2015. At
	December 31, 2014, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of
	approximately $152,300. This results in a deferred tax asset of $24,369.
	The Company had deferred tax assets of $1,676 as of December 31, 2014,
	resulting from the inventory allowance recorded. During the year ended
	December 31, 2015, the Company disposed of its wholly owned subsidiary
	which resulted in the disposition of $48,500 of net operating loss
	carryforwards and the $1,676 deferred asset relating to an inventory
	allowance. The Company has fully allowed for these assets as of the years
	then ended. The valuation allowance is estimated to be approximately
	$35,911 and $26,045 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014,
	respectively.

	Item
	9.           Changes in and
	Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure



	There were no disagreements related to accounting principles or
	practices, financial statement disclosure, internal controls or auditing scope
	or procedure during the two fiscal years and interim periods, including the
	interim period up through the date the relationship ended.






	Item 9A.        
	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of
	1934 (Exchange Act), our company carried out an evaluation, with the
	participation of our companys management, including our president (our
	principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal
	accounting officer), of the effectiveness of our companys disclosure controls
	and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of
	the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon that evaluation, our
	president (our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and
	principal accounting officer) concluded that our companys disclosure controls
	and procedures are not effective due to lack of segregation of duties to ensure
	that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that our
	company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed,
	summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules
	and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our
	companys management, including our president (our principal executive officer,
	principal financial officer and principal accounting officer), as appropriate,
	to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.



	Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over
	Financial Reporting



	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
	adequate internal control over financial reporting. As such term is defined in
	Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f), internal control over financial reporting is a
	process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and
	principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and
	effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide
	reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
	preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control
	over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i)
	pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
	fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of our company; (ii)
	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
	permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and
	expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
	authorizations of management and the directors of the company; and (iii) provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
	disposition of our companys assets that could have a material effect on the
	financial statements.


	As described above, our management conducted evaluation of the
	effectiveness of our companys internal control over financial reporting based
	on the criteria in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
	COSO. The matters involving internal controls that our management considered to
	be material weakness under COSO were:




	(a)



	insufficient written policies and policies and procedure
	for accounting and financial reporting; and





	(b)



	adequately segregate duties within the company due to an
	insufficient number of staff.





	Our management believes that the material weakness set forth
	above did not have an effect on our companys financial results as reported by
	the captioned filing. We are committed to improving our financial organization.
	Management believes that by preparing and implementing sufficient written
	policies, checklists and recruitment of sufficient full time staff will remedy
	the above-mentioned material weaknesses that we identified


	This report does not include an attestation report of our
	independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
	financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our
	companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission that permit our company to provide only
	managements report in this Report.







	Changes in Internal Controls



	During the period ended December 31, 2015, there were no
	changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially
	affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
	over financial reporting.

	9B.         Other Information



	None.

	Business Experience



	The following is a brief account of the education and business
	experience during at least the past five years of each director, executive
	officer and key employee of our company, indicating the persons principal
	occupation during that period, and the name and principal business of the
	organization in which such occupation and employment were carried out.



	Cindy Lee Kelly - President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief
	Financial Officer, Secretary, Treasurer and Director



	Ms. Kelly was appointed as president, chief executive officer,
	chief financial officer, secretary, treasurer and director of our company on May
	10, 2011.


	Cindy Kelly began her career in 1983 with MCL Electronics,
	Ltd., a Toronto based company that specialized in manufacturing and distributing
	electronic household products. In 1988, she joined Harada Antennas Ltd., as the
	Office Manager. In 1994, Ms. Kelly joined Supplier Services, Ltd., as general
	manager. In 1998 she was promoted to president. In 2005, Ms. Kelly joined DSL
	Products Limited. From 2005 to 2011 she was vice-president. In 2011, Ms. Kelly
	was named president and sole director of DSL Products Limited.


	In 2005, Ms. Kelly formed her own consulting firm  Cindy Kelly
	& Associates. She provides administrative and management services to a
	number of companies, including our company.






	Ms. Kelly does not hold any other directorships in any company
	with a class of securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act
	or subject to the requirements of Section 15(d) of such Act or any company
	registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.



	Significant Employees



	There are no individuals other than our executive officers who
	make a significant contribution to our business.



	Family Relationships



	There are no family relationships between any of our directors,
	executive officers and proposed directors or executive officers.



	Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings



	To the best of our knowledge, none of our directors or
	executive officers has, during the past ten years:




	 


	1.



	been convicted in a criminal proceeding or been subject
	to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other
	minor offences);





	 


	2.



	had any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the
	business or property of the person, or of any partnership, corporation or
	business association of which he was a general partner or executive
	officer, either at the time of the bankruptcy filing or within two years
	prior to that time;





	 


	3.



	been subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not
	subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent
	jurisdiction or federal or state authority, permanently or temporarily
	enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting, his involvement in
	any type of business, securities, futures, commodities, investment,
	banking, savings and loan, or insurance activities, or to be associated
	with persons engaged in any such activity;





	 


	4.



	been found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a
	civil action or by the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Commodity
	Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities
	or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or
	vacated;





	 


	5.



	been the subject of, or a party to, any federal or state
	judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not
	subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated (not including any settlement
	of a civil proceeding among private litigants), relating to an alleged
	violation of any federal or state securities or commodities law or
	regulation, any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or
	insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or
	permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money
	penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or
	prohibition order, or any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud
	or fraud in connection with any business entity; or





	 


	6.



	been the subject of, or a party to, any sanction or
	order, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any
	self-regulatory organization (as defined in Section 3(a)(26) of the
	Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26))), any registered entity (as defined in
	Section 1(a)(29) of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1(a)(29))), or
	any equivalent exchange, association, entity or organization that has
	disciplinary authority over its members or persons associated with a
	member.






	Compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934



	Our common stock is not registered pursuant to Section 12 of
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act).
	Accordingly, our officers, directors, and principal stockholders are not subject
	to the beneficial ownership reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
	Exchange Act.







	Code of Ethics



	We plan to adopt a code of ethics that obligates our directors,
	officers and employees to disclose potential conflicts of interest and prohibits
	those persons from engaging in such transactions without our consent.



	Board and Committee Meetings



	Our board of directors held no formal meetings during the year
	ended December 31, 2015. All proceedings of the board of directors were
	conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed
	with the minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented
	to in writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting
	of the directors are, according to the Nevada General Corporate Law and our
	Bylaws, as valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of the
	directors duly called and held.


	For the year ended December 31, 2015, there was no standing
	nominating committee or committee performing similar functions for our company.
	Ms. Kelly participates in the consideration of director nominees.



	Nomination Process



	As of December 31, 2015, we did not effect any material changes
	to the procedures by which our shareholders may recommend nominees to our board
	of directors. Our board of directors does not have a policy with regards to the
	consideration of any director candidates recommended by our shareholders. Our
	board of directors has determined that it is in the best position to evaluate
	our companys requirements as well as the qualifications of each candidate when
	the board considers a nominee for a position on our board of directors. If
	shareholders wish to recommend candidates directly to our board, they may do so
	by sending communications to the president of our company at the address on the
	cover of this annual report.



	Audit Committee



	We do not currently have an audit committee or a committee
	performing similar functions. The board of directors as a whole participates in
	the review of financial statements and disclosure.



	Audit Committee Financial Expert



	Our board of directors has determined that none of the members
	of our audit committee qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as
	defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K, and is independent as the
	term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, as amended.


	We believe that the members of our board of directors are
	collectively capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and
	understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. We
	believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit
	committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not
	warranted in our circumstances given the early stages of our development and the
	fact that we have not generated any material revenues to date. In addition, we
	currently do not have nominating, compensation or audit committees or committees
	performing similar functions nor do we have a written nominating, compensation
	or audit committee charter. Our board of directors does not believe that it is
	necessary to have such committees because it believes the functions of such
	committees can be adequately performed by our board of directors.

	(2)



	These amounts were paid to Cindy Kelly & Associates
	for the provision of all services related to our administration, office
	expenses and related overheads.






	Stock Option Plan

	options granted to our named officers or directors.



	Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End

	Compensation of Directors



	We have not provided any compensation to Ms. Kelly for
	performance of her services as our sole director and officer since the inception
	of our company.






	Ms. Kelly, our sole director and officer, has historically
	provided consulting services to our subsidiary through a consulting arrangement
	between our subsidiary, DSL Products Limited, and Cindy Kelly & Associates.
	On December 30, 2011, our subsidiary and Cindy Kelly and Associates entered into
	a written agreement in regards to this arrangement.



	Pension, Retirement or Similar Benefit Plans



	There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension,
	retirement or similar benefits for directors or executive officers. We have no
	material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash
	compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except
	that stock options may be granted at the discretion of the board of directors or
	a committee thereof.



	Indebtedness of Directors, Senior Officers, Executive
	Officers and Other Management

	Item
	12.           Security
	Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder
	Matters



	The following table sets forth, as of April 19, 2017, certain
	information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common shares by
	each shareholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our
	common shares, as well as by each of our current directors and executive
	officers as a group. Each person has sole voting investment power with respect
	to the shares of common stock, except as otherwise indicated. Beneficial
	ownership consists of a direct interest in the shares of common stock, except as
	otherwise indicated.

	Under Rule 13d-3, a beneficial owner of a security
	includes any person who, directly or indirectly, through any contract,
	arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (i)
	voting power, which includes the power to vote, or to direct the voting of
	shares; and (ii) investment power, which includes the power to dispose or
	direct the disposition of shares. Certain shares may be deemed to be
	beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share
	the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition,
	shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has
	the right to acquire the shares (for example, upon exercise of an option)
	within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In
	computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares
	outstanding is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned
	by such person (and only such person) by reason of these acquisition
	rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as
	shown in this table does not necessarily reflect the persons actual
	ownership or voting power with respect to the number of shares of common
	stock actually outstanding on April 19, 2017. As of April 19, 2017, we had
	34,760,008 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. All figures
	assume full dilution of convertible securities held.





	 


	 




	(2)



	Cindy Kelly has acted as our sole director and officer
	since May 10, 2011.











	Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation
	Plans



	There were no unexercised options, stock that has not vested
	and equity incentive plan awards for our named executive officers during the
	last two fiscal years.



	Changes in Control



	We are unaware of any contract or other arrangement the
	operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of our
	company.






	Item
	13.         Certain Relationships
	and Related Transactions, and Director Independence



	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $27,640
	(2014 - $62,819) of contractor expenses to the president of our company.


	Ms. Kelly is our only promoter, as defined in Rule 405 of
	Regulation C, due to her participation in and management of the business since
	our incorporation.


	Except as disclosed herein, no director, executive officer,
	shareholder holding at least 5% of shares of our common stock, or any family
	member thereof, had any material interest, direct or indirect, in any
	transaction, or proposed transaction since the year ended December 31, 2015, in
	which the amount involved in the transaction exceeded or exceeds the lesser of
	$120,000 or one percent of the average of our total assets at the year-end for
	the last three completed fiscal years.





	Director Independence



	We currently act with one director, Cindy Lee Kelly. We have
	determined that our director is not an independent director as defined in
	NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 4200(a)(15).


	We do not have a standing audit, compensation or nominating
	committee, our board of directors acts in such capacities. We believe that our
	board of directors is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial
	statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial
	reporting. The board of directors of our company do not believe that it is
	necessary to have a standing audit, compensation or nominating committee because
	we believe that the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by
	the our sole director. Additionally, we believe that retaining an independent
	director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be
	overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the
	early stages of our development.






	Item
	14.         Principal Accounting
	Fees and Services



	The aggregate fees billed for the most recently completed
	fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and for fiscal year ended December 31, 2014
	for professional services rendered by the principal accountant for the audit of
	our annual financial statements and review of the financial statements included
	in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services that are normally provided by
	the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or
	engagements for these fiscal periods were as follows:

	Total


	$10,000


	$26,200






	Effective May 6, 2003, the Securities and Exchange Commission
	adopted rules that require that before our independent auditors are engaged by
	us to render any auditing or permitted non-audit related service, the engagement
	be:



	approved by our audit committee (which consists of our entire board of
	directors); or


	entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established
	by the board of directors, provided the policies and procedures are detailed
	as to the particular service, the board of directors is informed of each
	service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the
	board of directors' responsibilities to management.



	Our board of directors pre-approves all services provided by
	our independent auditors. All of the above services and fees were reviewed and
	approved by the board of directors either before or after the respective
	services were rendered.


	Our board of directors has considered the nature and amount of
	fees billed by our independent auditors and believes that the provision of
	services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining
	our independent auditors independence.

	necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
	which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
	covered by this report;





	 


	 




	3.



	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and
	other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
	material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash

	report;





	 


	 




	4.



	The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are

	internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act
	Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and
	have:








	 


	(a)



	Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or
	caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
	supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
	registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
	by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which
	this report is being prepared;





	 


	 


	 




	 


	(b)



	Designed such internal control over financial reporting,
	or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
	under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
	reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
	statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles;





	 


	 


	 




	 


	(c)



	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's
	disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our
	conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
	procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
	such evaluation; and





	 


	 


	 




	 


	(d)



	Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
	internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
	registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal
	quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or
	is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
	control over financial reporting; and








	5.



	The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have
	disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
	financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee
	of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
	equivalent functions):








	 


	(a)



	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
	the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
	record, process, summarize and report financial information; and





	 


	 


	 




	 


	(b)



	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
	management or other employees who have a significant role in the
	registrant's internal control over financial
	reporting.

Overview































Creating perfect places







					                                         What creates the perfect place?
				





At Siemens, we believe in helping you create a perfect place – perfectly designed for its purpose. A place to learn, a place to develop, a place to grow, a place to succeed.















Your perfect place







					                                                                                                     How do you define the perfect place?
				





The definition of the perfect place is unique to your patients. Your students. Your customers. Each person you provide a place for needs peace of mind to believe that their hospital room is just the right temperature.  That their walk across campus is secure.  That their integrated systems remain operational.  And that their data centers provide the perfect environment for their servers. 

 
The freedom to create the perfect place is critical.


























					
                                        Perfect place to learn
				








At Kent School, officials know they are being trusted to provide more than an education. For parents, the safety, comfort, and security of their children is the top priority. It is a responsibility that Kent School dedicates its full attention and resources to fulfilling.
 
The expansive campus, situated along the historic Appalachian Trail, is one of Kent School’s biggest attractions, but also a challenge when it comes to emergency communication. Discover how  officials at Kent School implemented innovative technologies that have increased safety and emergency preparedness across its campus.











                                    Learn more about Kent School

                                                            Perfect place for medical minds
				








Healthcare organizations in the U.S. spend over $6.5 billion on energy each year, and that amount is increasing to meet rising patient satisfaction needs. Significant savings can be realized by focusing on improving the energy performance of existing equipment.
 
See how El Camino Hospital, ranked as the most technologically advanced hospital in the world in 2014 by Top Master’s in Healthcare Administration, partnered with Siemens to reduce energy costs while embracing new technology that integrates building automation and patient room temperature control drives quality care environments, and improves patient satisfaction.

The Yakima Regional Medical & Cardiac Center’s national rankings, awards, certifications, and accreditations demonstrate the entire team’s desire to deliver excellent care.  
 
To help keep prepared for The Joint Commission, NFPA, or local surveyor visits, Siemens proposed a Fire & Life Safety service program and a Healthcare Accreditation program that allows the center to confidently greet any surveyor – keeping the center’s operations, and more importantly patient care, uninterrupted.

As a leader in the digital transformation, knowing how to analyze building data enables us to continuously optimize our customers’ building performance – creating real value in their operations and supporting them in creating perfect places.

Building performance & sustainability







					                                                                                 Something drives us to make buildings better
				





With people spending about 90 percent of their lives indoors, there is no place where we spend more time in our life. So buildings are far more than just four walls. They are the places where we learn the most important lessons in life, where we encounter the personalities that inspire us, where the best of our ideas are born.

The City of Monterey Park, California has begun working toward its green agenda by leveraging both new, energy efficient technologies, as well as an innovative financing arrangement that guarantees energy savings to the City. With LED lighting upgrades, a new building automation system (Siemens Desigo CC™), energy-efficient HVAC technologies, and a new Bluetooth-enabled automatic water meter reading system, Siemens is helping the City of Monterey Park have a positive impact on both the community and the environment. Says Mayor Hans Liang, “It’s not easy for a municipality to commit to spending large amounts of money, even when we’re investing in a more sustainable future. But with Siemens cost-neutral program, we’re guaranteed those energy savings.”

					 One answer against climate change
				






Buildings account for 41 percent of energy consumption worldwide, and produce a third of greenhouse gas emissions. As public opinion calls for more environmental transparency and accountability from public and commercial organizations, improving your buildings’ efficiency is a necessary move. But it is also a smart one: With energy accounting for up to 30 percent of a building's lifecycle cost, performance optimization is a critical step in not just meeting sustainability expectations and emissions reduction targets - but a key lever to improve financial, regulatory and reputational standing.
