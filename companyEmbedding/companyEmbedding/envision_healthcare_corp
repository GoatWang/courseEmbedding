NEW YORK, July 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential securities fraud at Envision Healthcare Corp ("Envision" or the "Company") (NYSE:   EVHC).








The investigation focuses on whether the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws.  Specifically, on July 24, 2017, The New York Times reported on a study of Envision's billing practices conducted by researchers at Yale University.  The study asserted that emergency rooms associated with the Company were substantially likely to engage in so-called "surprise billing," by assigning out-of-network doctors to treat patients and then charging higher rates than were expected.
Following this news, Envision's share price declined during intraday trading on July 24, 2017, causing harm to investors.
