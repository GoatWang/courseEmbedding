                Daniel Kramer/HBJ            








 



Frank's International NV (NYSE: FI) announced that D. Keith Mosing stepped down from his position as executive chairman of the board, effective Dec. 31.
Mosing, grandson of the company's founder, previously served as president and CEO of the the company until Jan. 2015. His resignation marks the final step in the planned transfer of leadership at Frank's.

Daniel Kramer/HBJ










 


He was replaced in the president and CEO role last year by Gary P. Luquette, a member of the board. Michael C. Kearney, current supervisory board director and former CEO of DeepFlex Inc., takes Mosing's place as chairman.




Mosing will continue to serve as director of the company's supervisory board but will no longer be actively involved with Frank's on a day-to-day basis.
“I want to thank Keith for his service to Frank’s and its shareholders. His contributions have been significant in making Frank’s the company it is today," Luquette said in a statement. "Keith pioneered the expansion of international operations of the company and personally led the operation that today operates in approximately 60 countries. Personally, I have benefitted from his wisdom and experience over the past year and look forward to our continued relationship in his new role."
Mosing, who had been with Frank's for 43 years, took the company public in 2013. He was also featured in the Houston Business Journal's "What makes a CEO" story the following year.
Frank's is an oilfield services company with global headquarters in Amsterdam and its operational headquarters in Houston. Its largest operations are in Louisiana, and it specializes in casings, tubular services and equipment manufacturing.




 


The company cut about 13 percent of its workforce in April 2015 due to the ongoing oil slump.
