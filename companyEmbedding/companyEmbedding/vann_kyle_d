Title: Board Member
               Company: Mars Hill Productions
Job Details
               For more than 30 years, Mars Hill Productions has produced award-winning films and videos that have been used around the world to introduce thousands of people to Jesus Christ, and to motivate thousands more to share their faith in Christ with others. A non-profit, non-denominational media ministry, Mars Hill began in 1977 as a division of Youth for Christ/Houston and was spun off as a separate ministry in 1988. Mars Hill has produced media projects for evangelism, apologetics, discipleship and mobilization in a variety of genres including dramatic film, documentary and video curriculum. The most recent Mars Hill project, The HOPE, is an 80 minute dramatic presentation of God's redemptive story from creation through Christ. The HOPE has been so well received among missionaries worldwide that it has become the primary focus of Mars Hill's current season of ministry. This emphasis on The HOPE is manifested in translations, Internet ministry, derivative projects, and the worldwide dissemination of this dynamic media tool. While previous Mars Hill projects were primarily effective at reaching westernized audiences, The HOPE is being used to reach an extremely wide variety of tongues, tribes, and nations with the Gospel of Christ. Mars Hill is governed by a board of trustees and has been a member of the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability since 1992.
