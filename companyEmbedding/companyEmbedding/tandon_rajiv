Biography

Rajiv Tandon, MD, is the executive vice-chair and a professor at the University of Florida department of psychiatry. He also is chief of psychiatry at the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center. 
Formerly, he was promoted to Associate Professor, given Tenure and rose to Professor at the Department of Psychiatry in the University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor, from 1987-2004. In addition to his medical degree, he has a Master's degree in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis from the University of Michigan School of Public Health and a diploma in Business Administration from the Harvard University Business School. At the University of Michigan, he developed the clinical and research Schizophrenia Program, which was the sixth most published schizophrenia program in the world in the 1990's.
Additionally, he held a variety of administrative responsibilities, including directing the Hospital Services Division (inpatient, consultation-liaison, and emergency psychiatry) and Division of Community Psychiatry from 1996-2000. From 1993-1996, he was the Director of the Adult Inpatient Psychiatry Program and the electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) Program. At the University of Michigan Medical Center, his clinical responsibilities were primarily on the adult inpatient unit, which he directed from 1993-1996. His research focus has been the psychopathology and neurobiology of schizophrenia. Since 2000, he has been a member of the Scientific Council of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and on the Board of Directors of the National Schizophrenia Foundation (Chair 2002-2005).
Dr. Tandon has authored more than 250 scientific publications, and given over 600 national and international scientific presentations. He has received several awards for research and teaching in schizophrenia, including the American Psychiatric Association Young Psychiatrist Researcher of the Year award in 1993 and the a1997 Future Psych award for outstanding achievement in schizophrenia research. He has been included in every edition of THE BEST DOCTORS IN AMERICA since 1995. His principal areas of research interest include psychopharmacology of schizophrenia and neurobiology of schizophrenia. He is a member of the NASMHPD Medical Directors' Board, a member of the World Psychiatric Association Section on Pharmacopsychiatry, and a member of the DSM-V workgroup on psychotic disorders. He is also a member of the editorial boards of several journals. He has been a member of several NIH study sections over his career.
In his capacity Chief of Psychiatry in the Office of Mental Health in the Department of Children and Families, he has participated in the development of a number of innovative programs. He was a member of the Blueprint Commission on Juvenile Justice as also a member of the Supreme Court Subcommittee on Criminal Justice and Mental Health (Leifman committee). He has been intimately involved in the development of a range of evidence-based psychopharmacology programs both in the hospital-based and community settings. He has over 25 years of experience in the evaluation and treatment of psychiatric patients, as national expert, researcher, and mentor.
According to Dr Tandon " I am excited to relocate and work full time at the University of of Florida College of Medicine. I look forward to working with colleagues at Shands at Vista , the Shands NPEU. the VA and just the opportunity of participating in future development of the many excellent centers and research programs at the University of Florida College of Medicine. I think we can create an even more conducive atmosphere for successful academic growth. Enhanced federal research funding, development of a clinical and research center of excellence in psychotic disorders, more peer-reviewed publications in Schizophrenia and major psychiatric disorders, mentorship of junior faculty and residents reflected in their career development and K-awards, development of a Center for Translational Research and Clinical Effectiveness, and greater international presence/prominence would be useful indices of more excellence"
