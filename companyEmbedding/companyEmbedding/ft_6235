			PHASE III 6235 8' AM/FM Antenna Embark upon your next voyage w/ the most technologically advanced antenna we've ever created...Construction Goes High-TechPhase III antennas embody the ultimate in antenna design, construction and performance. We intend them for discerning, tech-conscious boaters who won't settle for less than the best, most versatile and most attractive antennas. For highest electrical efficiency, performance, and longevity, Phase III VHF and Cellular antennas start with silver-plated elements.

This sophisticated technique, which is no easy feat to manufacture, isolates the radiators from vibration and moisture for long, dependable service. Antenna mounting has also been designed for more versatility. Phase III's newly engineered ferrules accommodate a variety of installation possibilities, including standard 1" - 14 thread mounts, and strapping or clamping to a mast. The ferrule, its coupling ring, and the "N" connector at the base allow the antennas to be quickly and easily installed without re-routing your existing coax.This AM/FM Entertainment Band antenna takes AM/FM reception to new heights, and coordinates with the looks of other 8' Phase III antennas.FeaturesHigh-gloss, high-performance, non-yellowing polyurethane finishStainless steel mounting sleeveType "N" connector inside mounting sleeve for easy mounting and dismounting for stowageIncludes 20 RG-62 cable withMotorala type plug installed

											PHASE III 6235 8' AM/FM Antenna Embark upon your next voyage w/ the most technologically advanced antenna we've ever created...Construction Goes High-TechPhase III antennas embody the ultimate in antenna design, construction and performance. We intend them for discerning, tech-conscious boaters who won't settle for less than the best, most versatile and most attractive antennas. For highest electrical efficiency, performance, and longevity, Phase III VHF and Cellular antennas start with silver-plated elements. They also feature Shakespeare's unique low-angle radiation that puts your signal where it matters most. All of our extra heavy-duty Phase III radomes are completely foam-filled. This sophisticated technique, which is no easy feat to manufacture, isolates the radiators from vibration and moisture for long, dependable service. Antenna mounting has also been designed for more versatility. Phase III's newly engineered ferrules accommodate a variety of installation possibilities, including standard 1" - 14 thread mounts, and strapping or clamping to a mast. The ferrule, its coupling ring, and the "N" connector at the base allow the antennas to be quickly and easily installed without re-routing your existing coax.This AM/FM Entertainment Band antenna takes AM/FM reception to new heights, and coordinates with the looks of other 8' Phase III antennas.FeaturesHigh-gloss, high-performance, non-yellowing polyurethane finishStainless steel mounting sleeveType "N" connector inside mounting sleeve for easy mounting and dismounting for stowageIncludes 20 RG-62 cable withMotorala type plug installed

Shakespeare Am/Fm 8 Ft. 6235 Phase Iii AntennaShakespeare Am/Fm 8ft 6235 Phase Iii Antenna W/CablePHASE III 6235 8' AM/FM Antenna Embark upon your next voyage w/ the most technologically advanced antenna we've ever created...Construction Goes High-TechPhase III antennas embody the ultimate in antenna design, construction and performance. We intend them for discerning, tech-conscious boaters who won't settle for less than the best, most versatile and most attractive antennas. For highest electrical efficiency, performance, and longevity, Phase III VHF and Cellular antennas start with silver-plated elements. They also feature Shakespeare's unique low-angle radiation that puts your signal where it matters most. All of our extra heavy-duty Phase III radomes are completely foam-filled. This sophisticated technique, which is no easy feat to manufacture, isolates the radiators from vibration and moisture for long, dependable service. Antenna mounting has also been designed for more versatility. Phase III's newly engineered ferrules accommodate a variety of installation possibilities, including standard 1" - 14 thread mounts, and strapping or clamping to a mast. The ferrule, its coupling ring, and the "N" connector at the base allow the antennas to be quickly and easily installed without re-routing your existing coax.This AM/FM Entertainment Band antenna takes AM/FM reception to new heights, and coordinates with the looks of other 8' Phase III antennas.FeaturesHigh-gloss, high-performance, non-yellowing polyurethane finishStainless steel mounting sleeveType "N" connector inside mounting sleeve for easy mounting and dismounting for stowageIncludes 20 RG-62 cable withMotorala type plug installed Manufacturer Part Number: 6235

 Product Description

PHASE III 6235 8' AM/FM Antenna Embark upon your next voyage w/ the most technologically advanced antenna we've ever created...Construction Goes High-TechPhase III antennas embody the ultimate in antenna design, construction and performance. We intend them for discerning, tech-conscious boaters who won't settle for less than the best, most versatile and most attractive antennas. For highest electrical efficiency, performance, and longevity, Phase III VHF and Cellular antennas start with silver-plated elements. They also feature Shakespeare's unique low-angle radiation that puts your signal where it matters most. All of our extra heavy-duty Phase III radomes are completely foam-filled. This sophisticated technique, which is no easy feat to manufacture, isolates the radiators from vibration and moisture for long, dependable service. Antenna mounting has also been designed for more versatility. Phase III's newly engineered ferrules accommodate a variety of installation possibilities, including standard 1" - 14 thread mounts, and strapping or clamping to a mast. The ferrule, its coupling ring, and the "N" connector at the base allow the antennas to be quickly and easily installed without re-routing your existing coax.This AM/FM Entertainment Band antenna takes AM/FM reception to new heights, and coordinates with the looks of other 8' Phase III antennas.FeaturesHigh-gloss, high-performance, non-yellowing polyurethane finishStainless steel mounting sleeveType "N" connector inside mounting sleeve for easy mounting and dismounting for stowageIncludes 20 RG-62 cable withMotorala type plug installed Specifications:Antenna Band: AM/FMCable Length (Feet): 20'Cable Type: RG-62Color: WhiteConstruction: FiberglassLength (Inches): 8'Box Dimensions: 3"H x 3"W x 96"L WT: 7.53 lbsUPC: 719441200411Quick Guide (pdf)
