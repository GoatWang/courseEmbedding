History[edit]
Squibb[edit]
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica) after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the Materia Medica, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the American Civil War, providing portable medical kits containing morphine, surgical anesthetics, and quinine for the treatment of malaria (which was endemic in most of the eastern United States at that time).[9]
Bristol-Myers[edit]
In 1887, Hamilton College graduates William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of Clinton, New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it Bristol, Myers and Company. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the Bristol-Myers Corporation. The first nationally recognized product was Sal Hepatica, a laxative mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was Ipana toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.[10]
In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of acidophilus milk in East Syracuse, New York, and converted the plant to produce penicillin for the World War II Allied forces. After the war, the company renamed the plant Bristol Laboratories in 1945 and entered the civilian antibiotics market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[10][11] Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,[citation needed] but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other biologic medicines for clinical trials and commercial use.[12]
Merger[edit]
Bristol-Myers and Squibb were merged to form Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1989.
In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."
2000 to 2010[edit]
The company was involved in an accounting scandal in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "channel stuffing" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.[13] In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.[14] On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.[15] On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.[16] As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the FBI raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of collusion.[17] On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge Frederick B. Lacey, urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.[18] The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company. In 2009, a major restructuring involves focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs. As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.[citation needed] In August, BMS acquired the biotechnology firm Medarex as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.[19] In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas. Lamberto Andreotti was named CEO this year; he had previously served as "president and COO responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."[20]
2011 onward[edit]
Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in attempt to compete with Gilead/Pharmasset to produce Hepatitis C drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex's shareholders acceptance of 126 percent premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended at January 6.[21] On June 29, Bristol-Myers Squibb extended its portfolio of diabetes treatments when it agreed to buy Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc for around $5.3 billion in cash and will pay $1.7 billion to Eli Lilly to cover Amylin's debt and its obligations to Eli Lilly from ending the collaboration with Amylin. Astra Zeneca, who already collaborates on several diabetes treatments with BMS, will pay $3.4 billion in cash for the rights to develop Amylin's products.[22]
Citing major developments and a market capitalization of US$87 billion and stock appreciation of 61.4%, Bristol-Myers Squibb was ranked as the best drug company of 2013 by Forbes Magazine.[23]
In April 2014, BMS announced its acquisition of iPierian for up to $725 million.[24] In December the company received FDA approval for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in treating patients whose skin cancer cannot be removed or have not responded to previous drug therapies.[25] In February 2015, the company acquired Flexus Biosciences for $1.25 billion as well as initiating a research partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals which could generate more than $339 million. As part of the deal with Flexus, BMS will gain full rights to Flexus' lead small molecule IDO1-inhibitor, F001287.[26] In March, the company obtained an exclusive opportunity to both licence and commercialise PROSTVAC, Bavarian Nordic's phase III prostate specific antigen targeting cancer immunotherapy. Bavarian Nordic will receive an upfront payment of $60 million as well as incremental payments up to $230 million, if the overall survival of test patients exceeds that seen in Phase II tests. Bavarian could also receive milestone payments of between $110 million and $495 million, dependent on regulatory authorization, and these payments have the potential to total up to $975 million.[27]
In May 2015, Dr. Giovanni Caforio became CEO of the company;[28] Caforio was formerly the company's COO and succeeded Andreotti upon his retirement.[20] Andreotti subsequently succeeded James Cornelius as executive chairman upon his retirement.[20] In November, the company acquired the cardiovascular disease drug developer Cardioxyl for up to $2.075 billion. The deal strengthens the BMS' critical pipelines with the phase II candidate for acute decompensated heart failure, CXL-1427.[29]
In March 2016, the company announced it would acquire Padlock Therapeutics for up to $600 million.[30] In early July, the company announced it would acquire Cormorant Pharmaceuticals for $520 million, boosting BMS' onclogy offering through Cormorants monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin-8.[31]
In late February 2017, the Wall Street Journal and Fortune - among others - reported that activist investor, Carl Icahn, had taken a stake in the company, signalling a potential future takeover[32][33] from the likes of Gilead Sciences.[34]

History[edit]
Squibb[edit]
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica) after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the Materia Medica, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the American Civil War, providing portable medical kits containing morphine, surgical anesthetics, and quinine for the treatment of malaria (which was endemic in most of the eastern United States at that time).[9]
Bristol-Myers[edit]
In 1887, Hamilton College graduates William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of Clinton, New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it Bristol, Myers and Company. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the Bristol-Myers Corporation. The first nationally recognized product was Sal Hepatica, a laxative mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was Ipana toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.[10]
In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of acidophilus milk in East Syracuse, New York, and converted the plant to produce penicillin for the World War II Allied forces. After the war, the company renamed the plant Bristol Laboratories in 1945 and entered the civilian antibiotics market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[10][11] Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,[citation needed] but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other biologic medicines for clinical trials and commercial use.[12]
Merger[edit]
Bristol-Myers and Squibb were merged to form Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1989.
In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."
2000 to 2010[edit]
The company was involved in an accounting scandal in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "channel stuffing" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.[13] In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.[14] On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.[15] On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.[16] As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the FBI raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of collusion.[17] On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge Frederick B. Lacey, urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.[18] The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company. In 2009, a major restructuring involves focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs. As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.[citation needed] In August, BMS acquired the biotechnology firm Medarex as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.[19] In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas. Lamberto Andreotti was named CEO this year; he had previously served as "president and COO responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."[20]
2011 onward[edit]
Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in attempt to compete with Gilead/Pharmasset to produce Hepatitis C drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex's shareholders acceptance of 126 percent premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended at January 6.[21] On June 29, Bristol-Myers Squibb extended its portfolio of diabetes treatments when it agreed to buy Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc for around $5.3 billion in cash and will pay $1.7 billion to Eli Lilly to cover Amylin's debt and its obligations to Eli Lilly from ending the collaboration with Amylin. Astra Zeneca, who already collaborates on several diabetes treatments with BMS, will pay $3.4 billion in cash for the rights to develop Amylin's products.[22]
Citing major developments and a market capitalization of US$87 billion and stock appreciation of 61.4%, Bristol-Myers Squibb was ranked as the best drug company of 2013 by Forbes Magazine.[23]
In April 2014, BMS announced its acquisition of iPierian for up to $725 million.[24] In December the company received FDA approval for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in treating patients whose skin cancer cannot be removed or have not responded to previous drug therapies.[25] In February 2015, the company acquired Flexus Biosciences for $1.25 billion as well as initiating a research partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals which could generate more than $339 million. As part of the deal with Flexus, BMS will gain full rights to Flexus' lead small molecule IDO1-inhibitor, F001287.[26] In March, the company obtained an exclusive opportunity to both licence and commercialise PROSTVAC, Bavarian Nordic's phase III prostate specific antigen targeting cancer immunotherapy. Bavarian Nordic will receive an upfront payment of $60 million as well as incremental payments up to $230 million, if the overall survival of test patients exceeds that seen in Phase II tests. Bavarian could also receive milestone payments of between $110 million and $495 million, dependent on regulatory authorization, and these payments have the potential to total up to $975 million.[27]
In May 2015, Dr. Giovanni Caforio became CEO of the company;[28] Caforio was formerly the company's COO and succeeded Andreotti upon his retirement.[20] Andreotti subsequently succeeded James Cornelius as executive chairman upon his retirement.[20] In November, the company acquired the cardiovascular disease drug developer Cardioxyl for up to $2.075 billion. The deal strengthens the BMS' critical pipelines with the phase II candidate for acute decompensated heart failure, CXL-1427.[29]
In March 2016, the company announced it would acquire Padlock Therapeutics for up to $600 million.[30] In early July, the company announced it would acquire Cormorant Pharmaceuticals for $520 million, boosting BMS' onclogy offering through Cormorants monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin-8.[31]
In late February 2017, the Wall Street Journal and Fortune - among others - reported that activist investor, Carl Icahn, had taken a stake in the company, signalling a potential future takeover[32][33] from the likes of Gilead Sciences.[34]

History[edit]
Squibb[edit]
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica) after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the Materia Medica, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the American Civil War, providing portable medical kits containing morphine, surgical anesthetics, and quinine for the treatment of malaria (which was endemic in most of the eastern United States at that time).[9]
Bristol-Myers[edit]
In 1887, Hamilton College graduates William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of Clinton, New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it Bristol, Myers and Company. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the Bristol-Myers Corporation. The first nationally recognized product was Sal Hepatica, a laxative mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was Ipana toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.[10]
In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of acidophilus milk in East Syracuse, New York, and converted the plant to produce penicillin for the World War II Allied forces. After the war, the company renamed the plant Bristol Laboratories in 1945 and entered the civilian antibiotics market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[10][11] Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,[citation needed] but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other biologic medicines for clinical trials and commercial use.[12]
Merger[edit]
Bristol-Myers and Squibb were merged to form Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1989.
In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."
2000 to 2010[edit]
The company was involved in an accounting scandal in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "channel stuffing" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.[13] In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.[14] On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.[15] On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.[16] As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the FBI raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of collusion.[17] On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge Frederick B. Lacey, urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.[18] The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company. In 2009, a major restructuring involves focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs. As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.[citation needed] In August, BMS acquired the biotechnology firm Medarex as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.[19] In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas. Lamberto Andreotti was named CEO this year; he had previously served as "president and COO responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."[20]
2011 onward[edit]
Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in attempt to compete with Gilead/Pharmasset to produce Hepatitis C drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex's shareholders acceptance of 126 percent premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended at January 6.[21] On June 29, Bristol-Myers Squibb extended its portfolio of diabetes treatments when it agreed to buy Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc for around $5.3 billion in cash and will pay $1.7 billion to Eli Lilly to cover Amylin's debt and its obligations to Eli Lilly from ending the collaboration with Amylin. Astra Zeneca, who already collaborates on several diabetes treatments with BMS, will pay $3.4 billion in cash for the rights to develop Amylin's products.[22]
Citing major developments and a market capitalization of US$87 billion and stock appreciation of 61.4%, Bristol-Myers Squibb was ranked as the best drug company of 2013 by Forbes Magazine.[23]
In April 2014, BMS announced its acquisition of iPierian for up to $725 million.[24] In December the company received FDA approval for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in treating patients whose skin cancer cannot be removed or have not responded to previous drug therapies.[25] In February 2015, the company acquired Flexus Biosciences for $1.25 billion as well as initiating a research partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals which could generate more than $339 million. As part of the deal with Flexus, BMS will gain full rights to Flexus' lead small molecule IDO1-inhibitor, F001287.[26] In March, the company obtained an exclusive opportunity to both licence and commercialise PROSTVAC, Bavarian Nordic's phase III prostate specific antigen targeting cancer immunotherapy. Bavarian Nordic will receive an upfront payment of $60 million as well as incremental payments up to $230 million, if the overall survival of test patients exceeds that seen in Phase II tests. Bavarian could also receive milestone payments of between $110 million and $495 million, dependent on regulatory authorization, and these payments have the potential to total up to $975 million.[27]
In May 2015, Dr. Giovanni Caforio became CEO of the company;[28] Caforio was formerly the company's COO and succeeded Andreotti upon his retirement.[20] Andreotti subsequently succeeded James Cornelius as executive chairman upon his retirement.[20] In November, the company acquired the cardiovascular disease drug developer Cardioxyl for up to $2.075 billion. The deal strengthens the BMS' critical pipelines with the phase II candidate for acute decompensated heart failure, CXL-1427.[29]
In March 2016, the company announced it would acquire Padlock Therapeutics for up to $600 million.[30] In early July, the company announced it would acquire Cormorant Pharmaceuticals for $520 million, boosting BMS' onclogy offering through Cormorants monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin-8.[31]
In late February 2017, the Wall Street Journal and Fortune - among others - reported that activist investor, Carl Icahn, had taken a stake in the company, signalling a potential future takeover[32][33] from the likes of Gilead Sciences.[34]

History[edit]
Squibb[edit]
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica) after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the Materia Medica, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the American Civil War, providing portable medical kits containing morphine, surgical anesthetics, and quinine for the treatment of malaria (which was endemic in most of the eastern United States at that time).[9]
Bristol-Myers[edit]
In 1887, Hamilton College graduates William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of Clinton, New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it Bristol, Myers and Company. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the Bristol-Myers Corporation. The first nationally recognized product was Sal Hepatica, a laxative mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was Ipana toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.[10]
In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of acidophilus milk in East Syracuse, New York, and converted the plant to produce penicillin for the World War II Allied forces. After the war, the company renamed the plant Bristol Laboratories in 1945 and entered the civilian antibiotics market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[10][11] Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,[citation needed] but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other biologic medicines for clinical trials and commercial use.[12]
Merger[edit]
Bristol-Myers and Squibb were merged to form Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1989.
In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."
2000 to 2010[edit]
The company was involved in an accounting scandal in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "channel stuffing" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.[13] In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.[14] On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.[15] On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.[16] As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the FBI raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of collusion.[17] On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge Frederick B. Lacey, urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.[18] The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company. In 2009, a major restructuring involves focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs. As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.[citation needed] In August, BMS acquired the biotechnology firm Medarex as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.[19] In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas. Lamberto Andreotti was named CEO this year; he had previously served as "president and COO responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."[20]
2011 onward[edit]
Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in attempt to compete with Gilead/Pharmasset to produce Hepatitis C drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex's shareholders acceptance of 126 percent premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended at January 6.[21] On June 29, Bristol-Myers Squibb extended its portfolio of diabetes treatments when it agreed to buy Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc for around $5.3 billion in cash and will pay $1.7 billion to Eli Lilly to cover Amylin's debt and its obligations to Eli Lilly from ending the collaboration with Amylin. Astra Zeneca, who already collaborates on several diabetes treatments with BMS, will pay $3.4 billion in cash for the rights to develop Amylin's products.[22]
Citing major developments and a market capitalization of US$87 billion and stock appreciation of 61.4%, Bristol-Myers Squibb was ranked as the best drug company of 2013 by Forbes Magazine.[23]
In April 2014, BMS announced its acquisition of iPierian for up to $725 million.[24] In December the company received FDA approval for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in treating patients whose skin cancer cannot be removed or have not responded to previous drug therapies.[25] In February 2015, the company acquired Flexus Biosciences for $1.25 billion as well as initiating a research partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals which could generate more than $339 million. As part of the deal with Flexus, BMS will gain full rights to Flexus' lead small molecule IDO1-inhibitor, F001287.[26] In March, the company obtained an exclusive opportunity to both licence and commercialise PROSTVAC, Bavarian Nordic's phase III prostate specific antigen targeting cancer immunotherapy. Bavarian Nordic will receive an upfront payment of $60 million as well as incremental payments up to $230 million, if the overall survival of test patients exceeds that seen in Phase II tests. Bavarian could also receive milestone payments of between $110 million and $495 million, dependent on regulatory authorization, and these payments have the potential to total up to $975 million.[27]
In May 2015, Dr. Giovanni Caforio became CEO of the company;[28] Caforio was formerly the company's COO and succeeded Andreotti upon his retirement.[20] Andreotti subsequently succeeded James Cornelius as executive chairman upon his retirement.[20] In November, the company acquired the cardiovascular disease drug developer Cardioxyl for up to $2.075 billion. The deal strengthens the BMS' critical pipelines with the phase II candidate for acute decompensated heart failure, CXL-1427.[29]
In March 2016, the company announced it would acquire Padlock Therapeutics for up to $600 million.[30] In early July, the company announced it would acquire Cormorant Pharmaceuticals for $520 million, boosting BMS' onclogy offering through Cormorants monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin-8.[31]
In late February 2017, the Wall Street Journal and Fortune - among others - reported that activist investor, Carl Icahn, had taken a stake in the company, signalling a potential future takeover[32][33] from the likes of Gilead Sciences.[34]

History[edit]
Squibb[edit]
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica) after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the Materia Medica, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the American Civil War, providing portable medical kits containing morphine, surgical anesthetics, and quinine for the treatment of malaria (which was endemic in most of the eastern United States at that time).[9]
Bristol-Myers[edit]
In 1887, Hamilton College graduates William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of Clinton, New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it Bristol, Myers and Company. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the Bristol-Myers Corporation. The first nationally recognized product was Sal Hepatica, a laxative mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was Ipana toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.[10]
In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of acidophilus milk in East Syracuse, New York, and converted the plant to produce penicillin for the World War II Allied forces. After the war, the company renamed the plant Bristol Laboratories in 1945 and entered the civilian antibiotics market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[10][11] Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,[citation needed] but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other biologic medicines for clinical trials and commercial use.[12]
Merger[edit]
Bristol-Myers and Squibb were merged to form Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1989.
In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."
2000 to 2010[edit]
The company was involved in an accounting scandal in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "channel stuffing" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.[13] In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.[14] On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.[15] On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.[16] As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the FBI raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of collusion.[17] On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge Frederick B. Lacey, urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.[18] The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company. In 2009, a major restructuring involves focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs. As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.[citation needed] In August, BMS acquired the biotechnology firm Medarex as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.[19] In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas. Lamberto Andreotti was named CEO this year; he had previously served as "president and COO responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."[20]
2011 onward[edit]
Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in attempt to compete with Gilead/Pharmasset to produce Hepatitis C drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex's shareholders acceptance of 126 percent premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended at January 6.[21] On June 29, Bristol-Myers Squibb extended its portfolio of diabetes treatments when it agreed to buy Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc for around $5.3 billion in cash and will pay $1.7 billion to Eli Lilly to cover Amylin's debt and its obligations to Eli Lilly from ending the collaboration with Amylin. Astra Zeneca, who already collaborates on several diabetes treatments with BMS, will pay $3.4 billion in cash for the rights to develop Amylin's products.[22]
Citing major developments and a market capitalization of US$87 billion and stock appreciation of 61.4%, Bristol-Myers Squibb was ranked as the best drug company of 2013 by Forbes Magazine.[23]
In April 2014, BMS announced its acquisition of iPierian for up to $725 million.[24] In December the company received FDA approval for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in treating patients whose skin cancer cannot be removed or have not responded to previous drug therapies.[25] In February 2015, the company acquired Flexus Biosciences for $1.25 billion as well as initiating a research partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals which could generate more than $339 million. As part of the deal with Flexus, BMS will gain full rights to Flexus' lead small molecule IDO1-inhibitor, F001287.[26] In March, the company obtained an exclusive opportunity to both licence and commercialise PROSTVAC, Bavarian Nordic's phase III prostate specific antigen targeting cancer immunotherapy. Bavarian Nordic will receive an upfront payment of $60 million as well as incremental payments up to $230 million, if the overall survival of test patients exceeds that seen in Phase II tests. Bavarian could also receive milestone payments of between $110 million and $495 million, dependent on regulatory authorization, and these payments have the potential to total up to $975 million.[27]
In May 2015, Dr. Giovanni Caforio became CEO of the company;[28] Caforio was formerly the company's COO and succeeded Andreotti upon his retirement.[20] Andreotti subsequently succeeded James Cornelius as executive chairman upon his retirement.[20] In November, the company acquired the cardiovascular disease drug developer Cardioxyl for up to $2.075 billion. The deal strengthens the BMS' critical pipelines with the phase II candidate for acute decompensated heart failure, CXL-1427.[29]
In March 2016, the company announced it would acquire Padlock Therapeutics for up to $600 million.[30] In early July, the company announced it would acquire Cormorant Pharmaceuticals for $520 million, boosting BMS' onclogy offering through Cormorants monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin-8.[31]
In late February 2017, the Wall Street Journal and Fortune - among others - reported that activist investor, Carl Icahn, had taken a stake in the company, signalling a potential future takeover[32][33] from the likes of Gilead Sciences.[34]

Announcement

(PRINCETON, N.J. – June 10, 2017) – Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) is voluntarily recalling one lot (#HN0063) of Eliquis 5 mg tablets to the consumer level. This lot was distributed nationwide in the U.S. to wholesalers and retail pharmacies in February 2017. Bristol-Myers Squibb is taking this precautionary measure based on a customer complaint that a bottle labeled as Eliquis 5 mg was found to contain Eliquis 2.5 mg tablets.Patients should not stop taking Eliquis without consulting with their physician. Patients who are prescribed Eliquis 5 mg for an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) and take an Eliquis 2.5 mg tablet instead, particularly for a prolonged period, would have an increased probability of stroke, a moving blood clot, or death. For patients with Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in one of the deep veins usually in the leg, and Pulmonary Embolism (PE), a blood clot in the lung, underdosing of the drug could lead to an increased risk of a growing or moving blood clot. Should that occur, it could be life-threatening or reversible depending on the severity and location of the blood clot. To date, there have not been any reports of injuries or illnesses related to this issue.Eliquis tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people who have atrial fibrillation; it also treats blood clots in the veins of your legs or lungs as well as reduces the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had hip or knee replacement surgery. Eliquis 5 mg tablets are packaged in 60-count bottles, lot HN0063, Exp 09/2019, NDC 0003-0894-21. The recalled lot was distributed Nationwide in the U.S. to wholesalers and retail pharmacies in February 2017.There are distinct visible differences between the two tablet strengths including colors, size and markings that distinguish the 2.5 mg and 5 mg tablets (see photos) and decrease the likelihood of an incorrect dose. The 2.5 mg presentation is a yellow, round, biconvex, film-coated tablet with “893” debossed on one side and “2½” on the other side. The 5 mg presentation is a pink, oval, biconvex, film-coated tablet with “894” debossed on one side and “5” on the other side.Patient safety is our first priority. Bristol-Myers Squibb has notified wholesalers and pharmacies to arrange for return and replacement of any recalled product. Consumers that have product being recalled (Lot #HN0063) should contact their physician and call the Bristol-Myers Squibb Customer Information Center at 1-800-332-2056, Monday – Friday, from 8 AM – 8 PM EST or visit BMS.com for more information. Please see Eliquis U.S. Full Prescribing Information, including Boxed Warnings .This recall is being conducted with the knowledge of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Adverse reactions or quality problems experienced with the use of this product may be reported to the FDA's MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program either online, by regular mail or by fax. Consumers should contact their physician or healthcare provider if they have experienced any problems that may be related to taking this drug product.Complete and submit the report Online: www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersBristol-Myers SquibbBristol-Myers SquibbBristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, with 25,000 employees and $19.4 billion in revenue in 2016. The company faces challenges ahead, as analysts suggest it needs to boost the revenues of products aside from a few top performers and it fends off litigation by people who suffered injuries from using their products.Jump To TopicHistoryInvestigationsProblematic ProductsPlavixThe FutureJump To TopicSelect TopicHistoryInvestigationsProblematic ProductsPlavixThe FutureEstablished: 1858; 1887
Founders: Edward Squibb, William Bristol, and John Myers
Headquarters: New York City
2016 Revenue: $19.4 billion
Size: 250,000 employees worldwide
Problematic Products: Abilify, Plavix, Eliquis and Opdivo
Headquartered in New York City, Bristol-Myers Squibb operates research facilities in several countries, including Belgium, France, the UK and Japan. According to the company’s 2016 annual report, 55 percent of its global sales are in the U.S., with 22 percent in Europe. 
Its stated mission is “to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases.” At the end of 2016, the company reported it had 10 new compounds in clinical development.

Bristol-Myers Squibb headquarters
The company is known for biological and pharmaceutical research, producing the antipsychotic Abilify (which it helps market) and its blood thinners Plavix and Eliquis, as well as cancer drug Opdivo. Sales for Opdivo alone went from $942 million in 2015 to $3.8 billion in 2016. Eliquis sales rose from $1.9 billion in 2015 to $3.3 billion the following year.
Those numbers have a downside, as Bristol-Myers has faced criticism that it relies too heavily on a small number of drugs, which could threaten its future. Opdivo and Eliquis were responsible for almost 45 percent of its revenue in the first quarter of 2017. 
Over a year-long period ending May 12, 2017, the company’s stock shares ranged in price from $46.01 to $77.12.
“The underlying assumption,” says a report in Forbes, “is that Opdivo will live up to most of its potential and Eliquis will continue to be competitive and displace market leader Xarelto. However, there is some degree of unpredictability in the lung cancer market, at which the company hinted during its earnings call. The competition is increasing, as lung cancer is a key target for big pharma players because of the strong market potential.”
After a rough go for its stock in 2016, there had been talk of possible takeover, but analysts later concluded the company was not a good candidate for acquisition.
It has also run into some legal trouble along the way. During the 2000s, the company faced accusations of deceptive advertising campaigns and FDA violations. BMS has also had to deal with litigation related to two of its successful diabetes products, Byetta and Bydureon.
As reports of people suffering adverse events related to Eliquis and the Type 2 diabetes drug Farxiga grow, Bristol-Myers may face even more litigation.
History
The two companies that combined to form Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1989 share long histories of research and product development. In 1858, a young U.S. Navy doctor named Edward Robinson Squibb became so dissatisfied with the poor quality of medicines available during the Mexican War that he created his own pharmaceutical laboratory. E.R. Squibb, M.D., was founded in Brooklyn to produce consistently pure medicines. During the Civil War, Squibb became a major source of medicines for the Union Army. He invented the “Squibb pannier,” a compact medical kit that doctors could use on the battlefield.
William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers founded the second half of the company in 1887. After investing $5,000 in a failing drug manufacturing firm called Clinton Pharmaceutical Company, the friends installed themselves as president and vice president. Within a decade, they developed a national bestseller: “Sal Hepatica,” a mineral salt laxative. 

Bristol-Myers Origin
In 1898, the company changed its name from Clinton Pharmaceuticals to Bristol, Myers (the comma was eventually replaced with a hyphen).

The company struggled during the Great Depression and refocused its efforts on more lucrative consumer products such as laxatives and deodorant. E.R. Squibb and Sons continued to produce medical products and drugs such as castor oil and antibiotics. During World War II, both companies became leading suppliers of penicillin for the war effort. By 1943, Squibb operated the largest penicillin production plant in the world in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
After the war and into the 1960s, both Squibb and Bristol-Myers expanded their production and research of antibiotics. They merged in 1989, creating a powerhouse pharmaceutical company that was the second-largest in the world at the time. Since then, Bristol-Myers Squibb has continued to pursue cutting-edge clinical research while maintaining a significant philanthropic program.
In 2001, BMS spun off a medical devices division, Zimmer Holdings Inc. In 2012, in the culmination of a series of deals over the years to buy or partner with other drug companies, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced the acquisition of Amylin Pharmaceuticals, a biopharmaceutical company focused on research, development and commercialization of Type 2 diabetes drugs, including the troubled Byetta and Bydureon.
Investigations, settlements
In 2001, BMS reportedly persuaded wholesale customers to purchase about $2 billion more of drugs than they needed so the company could meet its sales goal that year. The accounting gimmick, known as “channel stuffing,” resulted in a sharp drop in revenue the next year and investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Justice Department. Frederick Schiff, the former chief financial officer, was indicted on securities fraud charges. The company agreed to pay a total of $839 million in restitution.


In 2007, BMS agreed to pay more than $515 million to resolve a broad array of cases involving its drug marketing and pricing. 

In addition to overcharging the government for drugs, BMS was also accused of promoting off-label use of the antipsychotic Abilify and setting inflated prices for a wide array of drugs.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 sent a warning letter to Bristol-Myers Squibb demanding compliance with regulations, citing microbiological contamination of drug products, environmental contaminations in facilities, and a lack of a scientifically sound standard for sampling plans and test procedures. Some of these infractions were repeat violations from inspections in 2005 and 2009.
Problematic Products
Bristol has also faced serious problems with some of its drugs. Two of these products — Byetta and Bydureon — resulted in lawsuits against Amylin, and BMS could face liability as well. The first Eliquis lawsuit was filed in 2015, and lawsuits have been filed alleging injuries from taking Farxiga as well.
Byetta and Bydureon

Learn About Byetta

Byetta is a twice-daily injection approved by the FDA to treat Type 2 diabetes. Bydureon — a longer-lasting version of Byetta — is injected once a week. With $517.7 million in sales in 2011, Byetta was a tremendous success for its developer, Amylin Pharmaceuticals. When BMS acquired Amylin in August 2012, it gained control of its blockbuster diabetes medications — and possibly liability for the drugs.
In a 2011 study, patients taking Byetta were found to be six times more likely to contract pancreatitis, a dangerous condition that causes the pancreas to become inflamed and can lead to hospitalization or death. Data also indicated Byetta patients could be up to 49 times more likely to contract pancreatitis than patients taking other drugs in the same class.
These dangerous side effects resulted in lawsuits that could affect Bristol-Myers. Dozens of cases have been filed, and more are expected as more patients and their families become aware of dangerous complications that may have resulted from their use of Byetta or Bydureon.
Courts consolidated cases against Byetta and Bydureon, as well as other Type 2 diabetes drugs, into a multi-district litigation court in the U.S. District Court Southern District of California where more than 350 cases are pending.
Eliquis


Learn About Eliquis

Eliquis, a newer blood-thinning drug, is prescribed for the prevention of dangerous blood clots and stroke in patients with a common type of abnormal heart rhythm. Developed in partnership with Pfizer as an alternative to the blood thinner warfarin, Eliquis joins Pradaxa and Xarelto as a next-generation anticoagulant.
The FDA approved Eliquis in 2013, two years after Pradaxa and one year after Xarelto. Sales of Eliquis grew from $146 million in 2013 to $774 million in 2014. But studies linked Pradaxa and Xarelto to a very dangerous side effect – uncontrollable bleeding. Patients on warfarin can take vitamin K to counteract bleeding, but there is no known antidote for next-generation anticoagulants.
The manufacturer of Pradaxa settled thousands of lawsuits that claimed the drug causes uncontrollable bleeding and death for $650 million in 2014. Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed against the manufacturer of Xarelto claiming the drug caused the same side effect. Those cases have already been consolidated in multidistrict litigation.
The first lawsuit claiming Eliquis caused uncontrollable bleeding and death was filed in 2015, and in February 2017, 53 federal cases from around the United States were consolidated in multidistrict litigation being heard in the Southern District of New York.
Farxiga


Learn About Farxiga

After being rejected twice by the FDA because of concerns with its association with bladder cancer, BMS finally received approval to market its Type 2 diabetes drug Farxiga (dapagliflozin) in January 2014. Farxiga is a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that stops glucose from being reabsorbed.
Less than a year after Farxiga entered the market, the FDA warned that SGLT2 inhibitors could cause a potentially fatal condition called ketoacidosis. Other studies also indicated people taking Farxiga have a high risk of developing bladder cancer.
In 2015, the FDA warned a similar SGLT2 inhibitor, Invokana, could increase the risk of bone fractures and decrease bone mineral density. It said it would investigate the safety of other SGLT2 inhibitors, like Farxiga.
In June 2016, the FDA strengthened its warning about the kidney risk for people taking Farxiga and Invokana. The agency said patients should seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs of acute kidney injury, such as decreased urine or swelling of the legs or feet, but should not stop taking their medication without talking to their doctors. 
Farxiga is also the subject of multidistrict litigation in the Southern District of New York, where 18 cases from various federal jurisdictions are being managed. The cases allege the drug caused injuries, including diabetic ketoacidosis and kidney damage.
Plavix
Approved in 1997, Plavix (clopidogrel) is an anticoagulant prescribed for people with risk of cardiovascular problems, including heart attacks and strokes. The drug went on to be the top selling drug in the United States, generating $7 billion in sales for the company in 2011. But the patent expired in 2012, and generic versions were approved for the market.
Studies have questioned the effectiveness and safety of the drug. 
In 2010, the FDA added a boxed warning for the anti-blood-clotting medication stating that people who didn’t effectively metabolize the drug don’t effectively convert Plavix to its active form in the liver, giving healthcare providers guidance. Poor metabolizers were estimated to be between 2% and 4% of the population.

FDA Warning
Using Plavix at the same time as omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, can reduce Plavix’s effectiveness.

The FDA has also warned against using Plavix at the same time as omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor antacid which is found in Prilosec OTC, Zegerid OTC and generic drugs. Taking the two substances at the same time can significantly reduce the effectiveness of Plavix. 
As of early 2017, BMS was being sued in more than 5,300 cases by people who claimed they or their loved ones were injured, in some cases fatally, from taking Plavix. The cases were pending around the country, including in New Jersey, Delaware, New York and California. Lawsuits alleged that although BMS marketed Plavix as “providing greater cardiovascular benefits, while being safer and easier on a person’s stomach than aspirin,” the drug actually created a substantial risk of “heart attack, stroke, internal bleeding, blood disorders or death.”
In June 2017, BMS won a significant victory in the U.S. Supreme Court, which ordered the dismissal of 592 Plavix cases brought in California by people from other states. The decision left only 86 remaining cases brought in California by Californians. The ruling limited cases to either the state where the company is located – in the case of BMS, that would be New York – or where the plaintiffs reside. The decision had immediate and ongoing effects on mass litigations across the country involving other products and companies.
The first impact of the ruling beyond Plavix came within hours of the decision when a judge in Missouri declared a mistrial in a trial involving out-of–state plaintiffs suing Johnson & Johnson because their loved ones died from ovarian cancer after using talcum powder.
The Future
Bristol-Myers Squibb has taken a hard hit in the last couple of years because of expirations on several of its most lucrative patents — including Plavix.
Less than a month after the FDA approval of Farxiga, BMS sold its global diabetes business that was part of its collaboration with AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca purchased the business for $2.7 billion, but BMS will receive royalties and sales-based milestones for its diabetes drugs until 2025.
Going forward, the company plans to focus on a strong research pipeline and double down on its “String of Pearls” strategy. The String of Pearls plan is an effort to accelerate discovery and development of new therapies by partnering with or acquiring both small and large pharmaceutical competitors. Today, more than 40 percent of BMS’s research pipeline and 50 percent of its revenue come from partnerships or alliances with other companies.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma and Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma is the nickname given to the world's vast and influential pharmaceutical industry and its trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA. Big Pharma and medical device companies make billions of dollars every year selling drugs and devices — including those that were recalled or involved in fraud or product liability lawsuits.Jump To TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryJump To TopicSelect TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryThe pharmaceutical industry — nicknamed Big Pharma — is one of the most powerful industries in the world. The global revenue for pharmaceuticals was over $1 trillion in 2014. But nowhere else in the world do the drug and medical device industries have as much power and make as much money as in the U.S.
In fact, Americans spent an all-time high of $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015. By 2020, it will be $610 billion. Medical devices are also lucrative. The U.S. makes up about half of the world’s share of the market at about $148 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

US based big pharma companies
Meanwhile, drug prices continue to rise. Consulting firm Segal Consulting expects drug prices for Americans under age 65 to rise 11.6 percent in 2017. In contrast, wages are only expected to rise 2.5 percent, leaving many American unable to afford their medications.
Big Pharma even contributes heavily to the annual budget of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through application fees (user fees) for its new products. Experts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the FDA’s budget.
Five of the top 10 pharma and medical device companies for 2016 are headquartered in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Gilead and AbbVie.
The underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud, bribery, product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements — a known cost of doing business for these companies who are “too big to jail.” Despite criminal charges and fines, the companies continue to do business.
Who is Big Pharma?
The majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies. Prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits. The biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices.
Pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices.


The most powerful drug and device companies are members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) — the industry’s U.S. lobbying organization.

With the help of staggering profits and an army of 1,378 paid lobbyists, the industry spreads its influence on Capitol Hill. From 1998 to 2016, Big Pharma spent nearly $3.5 billion on lobbying expenses — more than any other industry. In 2016 alone, it spent about $246 million — more than the defense industries and corporate business lobbyists combined.

Fact
Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma.

Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma. In fact, they are the second most hated industry in the U.S. They are also the biggest defrauder of the Federal Government under the False Claims Act, according to consumer watchdog group Public Citizen.
The Reputation Institute evaluated public perception of 17 pharmaceutical companies for products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship and financial performance. The Institute based its results on 16,800 ratings from the U.S., U.K., Canada and other countries.
Of all the countries, the U.S. had the lowest opinion of pharmaceutical companies. Older people had the most favorable view of the industry.

Medical Device Manufacturers
Medical devices can be anything from hospital diagnostic equipment to hip and knee implants. Several companies only produce medical devices, but some drug manufacturers, such as Johnson & Johnson, also manufacture devices.

Fact
Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).

Like Big Pharma, medical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group to pursue their interests in Washington.Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).
In 2016, it contributed $1.2 million in lobbying funds. Its efforts concentrate on medical device friendly bills in Congress mostly related to how companies pay taxes.
Five of the top medical devices companies have their headquarters in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Baxter International, Abbott Laboratories, Stryker and Boston Scientific.

Big Pharma’s Influence
Critics contend that Big Pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers, the FDA and the public to increase sales.
The public is exposed to Pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising. For example, critics say AbbVie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as AndroGel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men. They created a marketing campaign around the condition “Low T” that featured a quiz for men to self-diagnose Low T symptoms.

Androgel, above, was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up
The testosterone market soared into the billions as a result. But few studies back up drug-company claims that the drug significantly enhances mood, vitality and sexual performance. Studies also link these drugs to heart problems. The FDA added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk.
The American public is not the only sector of society influenced by Big Pharma’s techniques. Doctors, scientists and research organizations, medical journals, teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to Big Pharma.
Doctors conduct research with funds from Big Pharma. Private charities and foundations account for a mere 5 percent of the estimated $100 billion spent on biomedical research in the U.S. each year. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately 60 percent.
Big Pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout.

 The trade group PhRMA has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena, including:

36 who worked for a member of Congress
13 who worked for a federal agency
12 who worked for a congressional committee
Two who worked for the White House
One who worked in the court system


Using these connections to pursue industry goals, Big Pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest.
Marketing, Research and Development (R&D) and Drug Cost
Americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases, thousands of dollars more per prescription. Big Pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug.

Cost Facts
While companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.

The truth is that U.S. law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from free-market competition. Other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug. The true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery, with many unverifiable figures reported by Big Pharma.
Donald Light, a professor and expert on the pharma business model, said that while companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.
The industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing, which is almost double what it spends on research.
Big Pharma Sways Opinions
The large amount of cash Big Pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on direct-to-consumer advertising. The U.S. is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on TV (the other is New Zealand).


In 2015, Big Pharma spent $5.4 billion on direct-to-consumer ads and fired off about 80 ads an hour, according to Nielsen.

Big Pharma also employs doctors, researchers and institutions.
The industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting, paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal.

Paid copywriters were used in advertising Paxil,
above
Often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product. Big Pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs, including the antidepressant Paxil, the recalled weight loss drug Fen-Phen, the anti-epilepsy drug Neurontin, the antidepressant Zoloft and painkiller Vioxx, to name a few.
In addition, even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal, it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on Big Pharma’s payroll.
These slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence. Yet Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, says, “All journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry.”

Big Pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications. Consider the numbers:

Advertising instead of research: For every $1 spent on “basic research,” Big Pharma spends $19 on promotions and advertising.
Distribution of free drug samples: The U.S. has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five office-based physicians.
Sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions: Drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors, including covering meals, travel, seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations.


Many medical journals, including the esteemed Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), actively vie for the attention of Big Pharma advertising dollars, billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership.
How Big Pharma Influences Doctors and Researchers
Part of Big Pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive, brand name drugs.

Fact
In 2012, Big Pharma spent $24 billion on physician advertising, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.

Drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty. One 2016 study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than $20 they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug.
According to ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs investigation, 1,866 companies paid $6.25 billion to doctors and hospitals from August 2013 to December 2015.

Drug and Device Company Payments to Doctors from Select Companies, August 2013 to December 2015:



Company
PAYMENTS




DePuy (Johnson & Johnson)
$167 million


Stryker Corporation
$153 million


AstraZeneca
$145 million


Pfizer
$128 million


Janssen Pharmaceuticals
$106 million


GlaxoSmithKline
$86.3 million


Boston Scientific
$77 million




Big Pharma and Researchers
Then there are medical researchers, who are hardly immune to Big Pharma’s financial power. Because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer, too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers.
Sponsors keep the data, analyze it, write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication. Drug companies also stage-manage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light.
Medical Schools and Big Pharma
Big Pharma has also infiltrated medical schools. Teachers, department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors. This influences educational content. Money from Big Pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals, and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs.


The result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drug-intensive style of medicine.

Sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer, more expensive drugs are always better than old ones.
In most states, doctors must also take accredited education courses, called continuing medical education (CME). The pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on CME annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool.
In addition, academic centers are able to receive royalties from Big Pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds.
Columbia University, for example, received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the 17-year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products.
Columbia University received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesBig Pharma Fraud Settlements
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud, according to Public Citizen’s 2013 report Pharmaceutical Industry Settlements: 1991 through 2015.

Fact
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud.

The most common charge involved drug-pricing scams against state Medicaid programs. This meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while Big Pharma made billions.
Unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements. But these investigations take many years to complete. By then, drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion, while the U.S. Department of Justice fine is typically only a few million.
This makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies, according to Michael Bobelian of Forbes Magazine.

      Public Company Information:          




NYSE:BMY 






NEW YORK & DAEJEON, South Korea--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and SK 
      Biotek Co., Ltd. today announced the companies have signed a 
      definitive purchase agreement to sell Bristol-Myers Squibb’s small 
      molecule active pharmaceutical ingredient manufacturing facility in 
      Swords, Ireland, to SK Biotek, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SK 
      Holdings, based in Seoul, South Korea. The companies intend to 
      complete the deal by the fourth quarter 2017, at which time SK Biotek 
      will continue to manufacture the current portfolio of small molecule 
      pharmaceutical products at the site.
    

      The Swords facility currently manufactures active pharmaceutical 
      ingredients (APIs) for a number of medicines including Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb’s and Pfizer’s 
Eliquis. 
      Through the years, the site has produced medicines that have helped 
      millions of people in the fight against serious diseases such as cancer, 
      cardiovascular disease, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS and psychiatric disorders. 
      SK Biotek will operate the plant as a stand-alone Contract Development 
      Manufacturing Organization (CDMO), and intends to add marketing, 
      research and development (R&D) talent, and invest in upgrades to bring 
      additional capacity to the site. Bristol-Myers Squibb and SK Biotek will 
      manage a smooth transition to ensure reliable supply for customers and 
      patients.
    

      “This transaction is an important step to achieve our goal of becoming a 
      leading global CDMO.” Junku Park, Ph.D., chief executive officer of SK 
      Biotek, commented, “It allows us to enhance technological and 
      manufacturing capacity and build long-term partnerships with existing 
      and new customers. We have chosen to invest in Ireland because of the 
      welcoming business environment and the exceptionally talented workforce, 
      and we look forward to growing our presence in Swords in the coming 
      years. We are very pleased to welcome the Swords facility to SK Biotek.”
    

      “We value our partnership with SK Biotek and believe today’s agreement 
      will continue the vital role the Swords facility plays for its 
      employees, the community and patients,” said Lou Schmukler, president, 
      Global Product Development & Supply, Bristol-Myers Squibb. “Today’s 
      agreement is an important step in the ongoing evolution of our 
      manufacturing network to support the company’s innovative portfolio. Our 
      continued investment in Ireland is critical for our ability to deliver 
      transformational medicines to patients, both through the increased 
      biologics capabilities we are building in Cruiserath and our ongoing 
      commercial and business presence in Dublin.”
    

      SK Biotek and Bristol-Myers Squibb have an established relationship in 
      pharmaceutical manufacturing and supply. SK Biotek has been a supplier 
      to Bristol-Myers Squibb for 10 years and a key producer of commercial 
      API starting materials and chemical intermediates. With state of the art 
      R&D facilities, multi-purpose manufacturing plants and a deep foundation 
      in manufacturing technologies, SK has provided a high degree of 
      flexibility and quality service to Bristol-Myers Squibb and continues to 
      be a trusted partner from early phase development through to commercial 
      production.
    

      Bristol-Myers Squibb and SK Biotek anticipate that the transaction will 
      close during the fourth quarter of 2017. Closing of the transaction is 
      subject to SK Biotek’s receipt of certain environmental permits in 
      addition to other customary closing conditions. The transaction has been 
      approved by the boards of directors of both companies.

History[edit]
Squibb[edit]
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica) after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the Materia Medica, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the American Civil War, providing portable medical kits containing morphine, surgical anesthetics, and quinine for the treatment of malaria (which was endemic in most of the eastern United States at that time).[9]
Bristol-Myers[edit]
In 1887, Hamilton College graduates William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of Clinton, New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it Bristol, Myers and Company. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the Bristol-Myers Corporation. The first nationally recognized product was Sal Hepatica, a laxative mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was Ipana toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.[10]
In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of acidophilus milk in East Syracuse, New York, and converted the plant to produce penicillin for the World War II Allied forces. After the war, the company renamed the plant Bristol Laboratories in 1945 and entered the civilian antibiotics market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[10][11] Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,[citation needed] but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other biologic medicines for clinical trials and commercial use.[12]
Merger[edit]
Bristol-Myers and Squibb were merged to form Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1989.
In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."
2000 to 2010[edit]
The company was involved in an accounting scandal in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "channel stuffing" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.[13] In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.[14] On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.[15] On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.[16] As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the FBI raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of collusion.[17] On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge Frederick B. Lacey, urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.[18] The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company. In 2009, a major restructuring involves focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs. As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.[citation needed] In August, BMS acquired the biotechnology firm Medarex as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.[19] In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas. Lamberto Andreotti was named CEO this year; he had previously served as "president and COO responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."[20]
2011 onward[edit]
Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in attempt to compete with Gilead/Pharmasset to produce Hepatitis C drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex's shareholders acceptance of 126 percent premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended at January 6.[21] On June 29, Bristol-Myers Squibb extended its portfolio of diabetes treatments when it agreed to buy Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc for around $5.3 billion in cash and will pay $1.7 billion to Eli Lilly to cover Amylin's debt and its obligations to Eli Lilly from ending the collaboration with Amylin. Astra Zeneca, who already collaborates on several diabetes treatments with BMS, will pay $3.4 billion in cash for the rights to develop Amylin's products.[22]
Citing major developments and a market capitalization of US$87 billion and stock appreciation of 61.4%, Bristol-Myers Squibb was ranked as the best drug company of 2013 by Forbes Magazine.[23]
In April 2014, BMS announced its acquisition of iPierian for up to $725 million.[24] In December the company received FDA approval for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in treating patients whose skin cancer cannot be removed or have not responded to previous drug therapies.[25] In February 2015, the company acquired Flexus Biosciences for $1.25 billion as well as initiating a research partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals which could generate more than $339 million. As part of the deal with Flexus, BMS will gain full rights to Flexus' lead small molecule IDO1-inhibitor, F001287.[26] In March, the company obtained an exclusive opportunity to both licence and commercialise PROSTVAC, Bavarian Nordic's phase III prostate specific antigen targeting cancer immunotherapy. Bavarian Nordic will receive an upfront payment of $60 million as well as incremental payments up to $230 million, if the overall survival of test patients exceeds that seen in Phase II tests. Bavarian could also receive milestone payments of between $110 million and $495 million, dependent on regulatory authorization, and these payments have the potential to total up to $975 million.[27]
In May 2015, Dr. Giovanni Caforio became CEO of the company;[28] Caforio was formerly the company's COO and succeeded Andreotti upon his retirement.[20] Andreotti subsequently succeeded James Cornelius as executive chairman upon his retirement.[20] In November, the company acquired the cardiovascular disease drug developer Cardioxyl for up to $2.075 billion. The deal strengthens the BMS' critical pipelines with the phase II candidate for acute decompensated heart failure, CXL-1427.[29]
In March 2016, the company announced it would acquire Padlock Therapeutics for up to $600 million.[30] In early July, the company announced it would acquire Cormorant Pharmaceuticals for $520 million, boosting BMS' onclogy offering through Cormorants monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin-8.[31]
In late February 2017, the Wall Street Journal and Fortune - among others - reported that activist investor, Carl Icahn, had taken a stake in the company, signalling a potential future takeover[32][33] from the likes of Gilead Sciences.[34]

Squibb, " Ephemeris of Materia Medica", etc., on page 673, vol. ii., No. 5, where a brief allusion appears under the appellation of Compound Alum Powder. Dr. F. R.

History[edit]
Squibb[edit]
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica) after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the Materia Medica, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the American Civil War, providing portable medical kits containing morphine, surgical anesthetics, and quinine for the treatment of malaria (which was endemic in most of the eastern United States at that time).[9]
Bristol-Myers[edit]
In 1887, Hamilton College graduates William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of Clinton, New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it Bristol, Myers and Company. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the Bristol-Myers Corporation. The first nationally recognized product was Sal Hepatica, a laxative mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was Ipana toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.[10]
In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of acidophilus milk in East Syracuse, New York, and converted the plant to produce penicillin for the World War II Allied forces. After the war, the company renamed the plant Bristol Laboratories in 1945 and entered the civilian antibiotics market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[10][11] Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,[citation needed] but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other biologic medicines for clinical trials and commercial use.[12]
Merger[edit]
Bristol-Myers and Squibb were merged to form Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1989.
In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."
2000 to 2010[edit]
The company was involved in an accounting scandal in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "channel stuffing" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.[13] In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.[14] On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.[15] On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.[16] As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the FBI raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of collusion.[17] On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge Frederick B. Lacey, urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.[18] The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company. In 2009, a major restructuring involves focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs. As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.[citation needed] In August, BMS acquired the biotechnology firm Medarex as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.[19] In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas. Lamberto Andreotti was named CEO this year; he had previously served as "president and COO responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."[20]
2011 onward[edit]
Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in attempt to compete with Gilead/Pharmasset to produce Hepatitis C drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex's shareholders acceptance of 126 percent premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended at January 6.[21] On June 29, Bristol-Myers Squibb extended its portfolio of diabetes treatments when it agreed to buy Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc for around $5.3 billion in cash and will pay $1.7 billion to Eli Lilly to cover Amylin's debt and its obligations to Eli Lilly from ending the collaboration with Amylin. Astra Zeneca, who already collaborates on several diabetes treatments with BMS, will pay $3.4 billion in cash for the rights to develop Amylin's products.[22]
Citing major developments and a market capitalization of US$87 billion and stock appreciation of 61.4%, Bristol-Myers Squibb was ranked as the best drug company of 2013 by Forbes Magazine.[23]
In April 2014, BMS announced its acquisition of iPierian for up to $725 million.[24] In December the company received FDA approval for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in treating patients whose skin cancer cannot be removed or have not responded to previous drug therapies.[25] In February 2015, the company acquired Flexus Biosciences for $1.25 billion as well as initiating a research partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals which could generate more than $339 million. As part of the deal with Flexus, BMS will gain full rights to Flexus' lead small molecule IDO1-inhibitor, F001287.[26] In March, the company obtained an exclusive opportunity to both licence and commercialise PROSTVAC, Bavarian Nordic's phase III prostate specific antigen targeting cancer immunotherapy. Bavarian Nordic will receive an upfront payment of $60 million as well as incremental payments up to $230 million, if the overall survival of test patients exceeds that seen in Phase II tests. Bavarian could also receive milestone payments of between $110 million and $495 million, dependent on regulatory authorization, and these payments have the potential to total up to $975 million.[27]
In May 2015, Dr. Giovanni Caforio became CEO of the company;[28] Caforio was formerly the company's COO and succeeded Andreotti upon his retirement.[20] Andreotti subsequently succeeded James Cornelius as executive chairman upon his retirement.[20] In November, the company acquired the cardiovascular disease drug developer Cardioxyl for up to $2.075 billion. The deal strengthens the BMS' critical pipelines with the phase II candidate for acute decompensated heart failure, CXL-1427.[29]
In March 2016, the company announced it would acquire Padlock Therapeutics for up to $600 million.[30] In early July, the company announced it would acquire Cormorant Pharmaceuticals for $520 million, boosting BMS' onclogy offering through Cormorants monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin-8.[31]
In late February 2017, the Wall Street Journal and Fortune - among others - reported that activist investor, Carl Icahn, had taken a stake in the company, signalling a potential future takeover[32][33] from the likes of Gilead Sciences.[34]

The writer noticed (in December, 1882) the important fact that when common or Japan camphor and crystallized carbolic acid are mixed together and subjected to heat, a colorless liquid would be the result. The only reference he finds so far with regard to this reaction occurs in the very excellent and valuable scientific publication of Dr. E. R. Squibb, " Ephemeris of Materia Medica", etc., on page 673, vol. ii., No. 5, where a brief allusion appears under the appellation of Compound Alum Powder. Dr. F. R. Squibb, however, in a letter to the writer states that he has " several times before heard of this reaction between phenol and camphor.

Bristol-Myers Squibb, often referred to as BMS, is an American pharmaceutical company, headquartered in New York City.
Bristol-Myers Squibb manufactures prescription pharmaceuticals in several therapeutic areas, including cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis and psychiatric disorders. Its mission is to "discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases."
BMS' primary R&D sites are located in Lawrence Township, New Jersey (formerly Squibb, near Princeton) and Wallingford, Connecticut (formerly Bristol-Myers); with other sites in East Syracuse, New York; Hopewell and New Brunswick, New Jersey; and in Swords, Ireland; Braine-l'Alleud, Belgium; Tokyo, Japan; and Bangalore, India.[2]

History[edit]
Squibb[edit]
The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as a vigorous advocate of quality control and high purity standards within the fledgling pharmaceutical industry of his time, at one point self-publishing an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia (Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica) after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards. Mentions of the Materia Medica, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the utility and best method of preparation for various medicants are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s.[3][4][5][6][7][8] Squibb Corporation served as a major supplier of medical goods to the Union Army during the American Civil War, providing portable medical kits containing morphine, surgical anesthetics, and quinine for the treatment of malaria (which was endemic in most of the eastern United States at that time).[9]
Bristol-Myers[edit]
In 1887, Hamilton College graduates William McLaren Bristol and John Ripley Myers purchased the Clinton Pharmaceutical company of Clinton, New York. In 1898, they decided to rename it Bristol, Myers and Company. Following Myers' death in 1899, Bristol changed the name to the Bristol-Myers Corporation. The first nationally recognized product was Sal Hepatica, a laxative mineral salt in 1903. Its second national success was Ipana toothpaste, from 1901 through the 1960s.[10]
In 1943, Bristol-Myers acquired Cheplin Biological Laboratories, a producer of acidophilus milk in East Syracuse, New York, and converted the plant to produce penicillin for the World War II Allied forces. After the war, the company renamed the plant Bristol Laboratories in 1945 and entered the civilian antibiotics market, where it faced competition from Squibb, which had opened the world's largest penicillin plant in 1944 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.[10][11] Penicillin production at the East Syracuse plant was ended in 2005, when it became less expensive to produce overseas,[citation needed] but the facility continues to be used for the manufacturing process development and production of other biologic medicines for clinical trials and commercial use.[12]
Merger[edit]
Bristol-Myers and Squibb were merged to form Bristol-Myers Squibb in 1989.
In 1999, President Clinton awarded Bristol-Myers Squibb the National Medal of Technology, the nation's highest recognition for technological achievement, "for extending and enhancing human life through innovative pharmaceutical research and development and for redefining the science of clinical study through groundbreaking and hugely complex clinical trials that are recognized models in the industry."
2000 to 2010[edit]
The company was involved in an accounting scandal in 2002 that resulted in a significant restatement of revenues from 1999 to 2001. The restatement was the result of an improper booking of sales related to "channel stuffing" as the practice of offering excess inventory to customers to create higher sales numbers. The company has since settled with the United States Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission, agreeing to pay $150 million while neither admitting nor denying guilt.[13] In 2002, the company was involved in a lawsuit of maintaining illegally a monopoly on Taxol, its cancer treatment, and it was again sued for the antitrust lawsuit 5 years later, which cost the company $125 million for settlement.[14] On October 24, 2002, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. restated earnings downward for parts of 2000 and 2001 while revising this year's earnings upward because of its massive inventory backlog imbroglio that spurred two government investigations.[15] On March 15, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. adjusted upward its fourth-quarter and full-year 2003 results after reversing an earlier decision about how to deal with accounting errors made in prior years.[16] As part of a Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the company was placed under the oversight of a monitor appointed by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey. In addition, the former head of the Pharma group, Richard Lane, and the ex-CFO, Fred Schiff, were indicted for federal securities violations.An investigation of the company was made public in July 2006, and the FBI raided the company's corporate offices. The investigation centered on the distribution of Plavix and charges of collusion.[17] On September 12, 2006, the monitor, former Federal Judge Frederick B. Lacey, urged the company to remove then CEO Peter Dolan over the Plavix dispute. Later that day, BMS announced that Dolan would indeed step down.[18] The Deferred Prosecution Agreement expired in June 2007 and the Department of Justice did not take any further legal action against the company for matters covered by the DPA. Under CEO Jim Cornelius, who was CEO following Dolan until May 2010, all executives involved in the "channel-stuffing" and generic competition scandals have since left the company. In 2009, a major restructuring involves focusing on the pharmaceutical business and biologic products, along with productivity initiatives and cost-cutting and streamlining business operations through a multi-year program of on-going layoffs. As another cost-cutting measure Bristol-Myers also reduced subsidies for health-care to retirees and plans to freeze their pension plan at the end of 2009.[citation needed] In August, BMS acquired the biotechnology firm Medarex as part of the company's "String of Pearls" strategy of alliances, partnerships and acquisitions.[19] In November, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it was "splitting off" Mead Johnson Nutrition by offering BMY shareholders the opportunity to exchange their stock for shares in Mead Johnson. According to Bristol-Myers Squibb, this move was expected to further sharpen the company's focus on biopharmaceuticals. BMS is a Fortune 500 Company (#114 in 2010 list). Newsweek's 2009 Green Ranking recognized Bristol-Myers Squibb as 8th among 500 of the largest United States corporations. Also, BMS was included in the 2009 Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index of leading sustainability-driven companies. In October 2010, the company acquired ZymoGenetics, securing an existing product as well as pipeline assets in hepatitis C, cancer and other therapeutic areas. Lamberto Andreotti was named CEO this year; he had previously served as "president and COO responsible for all pharmaceutical operations worldwide."[20]
2011 onward[edit]
Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay around $2.5 billion in cash to buy Inhibitex Inc. in attempt to compete with Gilead/Pharmasset to produce Hepatitis C drugs. The settlement will be finished in 2 months for its Inhibitex's shareholders acceptance of 126 percent premium price of its price over the previous 20 trading days ended at January 6.[21] On June 29, Bristol-Myers Squibb extended its portfolio of diabetes treatments when it agreed to buy Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc for around $5.3 billion in cash and will pay $1.7 billion to Eli Lilly to cover Amylin's debt and its obligations to Eli Lilly from ending the collaboration with Amylin. Astra Zeneca, who already collaborates on several diabetes treatments with BMS, will pay $3.4 billion in cash for the rights to develop Amylin's products.[22]
Citing major developments and a market capitalization of US$87 billion and stock appreciation of 61.4%, Bristol-Myers Squibb was ranked as the best drug company of 2013 by Forbes Magazine.[23]
In April 2014, BMS announced its acquisition of iPierian for up to $725 million.[24] In December the company received FDA approval for the use of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab (Opdivo) in treating patients whose skin cancer cannot be removed or have not responded to previous drug therapies.[25] In February 2015, the company acquired Flexus Biosciences for $1.25 billion as well as initiating a research partnership with Rigel Pharmaceuticals which could generate more than $339 million. As part of the deal with Flexus, BMS will gain full rights to Flexus' lead small molecule IDO1-inhibitor, F001287.[26] In March, the company obtained an exclusive opportunity to both licence and commercialise PROSTVAC, Bavarian Nordic's phase III prostate specific antigen targeting cancer immunotherapy. Bavarian Nordic will receive an upfront payment of $60 million as well as incremental payments up to $230 million, if the overall survival of test patients exceeds that seen in Phase II tests. Bavarian could also receive milestone payments of between $110 million and $495 million, dependent on regulatory authorization, and these payments have the potential to total up to $975 million.[27]
In May 2015, Dr. Giovanni Caforio became CEO of the company;[28] Caforio was formerly the company's COO and succeeded Andreotti upon his retirement.[20] Andreotti subsequently succeeded James Cornelius as executive chairman upon his retirement.[20] In November, the company acquired the cardiovascular disease drug developer Cardioxyl for up to $2.075 billion. The deal strengthens the BMS' critical pipelines with the phase II candidate for acute decompensated heart failure, CXL-1427.[29]
In March 2016, the company announced it would acquire Padlock Therapeutics for up to $600 million.[30] In early July, the company announced it would acquire Cormorant Pharmaceuticals for $520 million, boosting BMS' onclogy offering through Cormorants monoclonal antibody targeted against interleukin-8.[31]
In late February 2017, the Wall Street Journal and Fortune - among others - reported that activist investor, Carl Icahn, had taken a stake in the company, signalling a potential future takeover[32][33] from the likes of Gilead Sciences.[34]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
