 Product Description 

Follow the prophet from the First Vision to Carthage- and experience, through world-class narration and powerful music, what it was like to be Joseph. Nationally renowned producers Jason Deere (producer of Ryan Shupe and ShEDAISY) and Dan Truman (Diamond Rio) have taken LDS music to new heights — capturing both the trying and the joyful times of Joseph — with a brand new country flavor. With David Osmond, Ryan Shupe, Dale Murphy and more.

  i love this cdBy matthew, Submitted on 2015-02-25I love it and play it alot
 




  This is music heard by a chorale of angelsBy Holly, Submitted on 2015-02-25I rarely write a music review- so thus it stands that I have been incredibly touched by this CD as well as The Trek.  I do not know if there is words to describe the feelings each time I have played the CD- which I have now had to purchase another one because my first one has been worn out.  Many times this music has brought me thru great depths of grief and inspired my spirit to keep reaching beyond. My testimony of the Prophet Joseph and our latter day prophets has been forever concreted in testimony because the words spoken.  I am not sure it would touch eveyone like that- but for me- it was a chorale of angels sent. Besides the words,  I LOVE the music!!!!!!
Thank you for sharing such a gift of talent and please please carry on, carry on, carry on!!!!
 




  BEST LDS MUSIC CDBy Shantelle, Submitted on 2015-02-25This CD will appeal to a wide variety of musical tastes, not just country. Each song is about a different stage/aspect of Joseph Smith's life. It is easily my favorite in my LDS collection. The messages in the music never fail to invite the spirit.  This CD helped me find a deeper testimony of Joseph Smith at a time when I was questioning what I believed.  Brother I Will Follow You has become my long standing favorite as I really feel Joseph Smith's love for the Lord and that in turn inspires my commitment to serve the Lord as faithfully as Brother Joseph did. I can't rate this CD highly enough. Buy it for you.  Buy it for your family.  Buy it for your friends.  
 




  GREAT! Our family loved it!By Jo Anna, Submitted on 2015-02-25This was a great CD for our whole family. My kids request it. We enjoy country music and this style was something we could relate to.  The music carries your through several emotions and allows you to feel what these individuals may have felt.
 




  IncredibleBy Sandy, Submitted on 2015-02-25I can't stop listening to this cd. It's on at home, in the car and our family loves it.  Its become a great teaching tool for us too, as our children ask questions about the different people that are talked about.  Thank you Jason Deere for your inspiring music. 
 




  Brilliant Moving InspiringBy Naomi, Submitted on 2015-02-25We're an Aussie Family and we all love this CD.  It is a favourite in our car any day of the week.
I have 4 boys from 4 to 11 and they all sing along and ask questions.  It's been a great point of conversations in our car on travels. My husband even loves it.  We would really love to hear more inspiring music of it's Nashville kind. What a wonderful tribute to a prophet!
 




  A beautiful tribute to the prophet JosephBy Elizabeth, Submitted on 2015-02-25A beautiful tribute to the Prophet Joseph, this time with some twang!
 




  Great TributeBy Travis, Submitted on 2015-02-25Wonderful music and you can't help but like Jason Deere. He is an awesome guy.
 




  Had To Have ItBy Avis, Submitted on 2015-02-25Some of these tracks were performed live at 'Time Out' in Kansas City last year, and I had to have the album.  I love listening to the lyrics.
 




  Love it!By Tracy, Submitted on 2015-02-25Very insightful and well done.
 




  Warning: This cd may result in your whole Ward doing a play!By Saren, Submitted on 2015-02-25Hi! I live in Hawaii at the moment, but I used to live in Leavenworth Kansas. I am a mia maid and my ward (Leavenworth 1st, one of the most amazing wards I have ever met)loved this cd alot. We decided that we were going to do a whole performance revolving around that cd. We had one of the mia maid's father learn all the songs and played them on the guitar along with a live band at the night of the performance. All of the young women and men learned dance moves, added a script, and a few extra songs.In febuary, we all went to Nauvoo and learned about Joseph Smith, took part in the Exodus Walk, and bore our testimony in the Seventies Hall to understand the play were were working on. We worked on it for a good long 5 months, and it was a hit! It was an amazing experience and helped everyone's testimony grow. And to this day I now know the words to all of the songs on that cd, as well as a few dance moves. I love this CD and recomend it to every LDS teen and adult.
 




  Absolutely loved CDBy kandi, Submitted on 2015-02-25This CD taught me  about the gospel through word and music. I loved it!
 




  Wonderful CDBy Carol, Submitted on 2015-02-25This is a beautiful CD that my entire family can agree upon while driving together in our van. The words and music are moving and inspiring. Thank you for the insight this CD provides into the life of the Prophet Joseph, his family, and associates. I love this CD and I highly recommend it.
 




  Beautiful!!!!By Cory, Submitted on 2015-02-25The songs are beautiful!!!!!!
 




  My less-active son loves it!By R. Scott, Submitted on 2015-02-25My son has not been terribly active for the last year, but he has been touched by the music from this CD. It's the only disc in his collection that he will not part with for any length of time. What a fitting tribute to the Prophet Joseph that such a tribute could touch the hearts of those who are flirting with inactivity.
Thank you to all of the artists responsible for this wonderful CD.
 




  Sweet!By Brady, Submitted on 2015-02-25Great CD!  Love the songs!
 




  Great MusicBy Erica, Submitted on 2015-02-25I love this CD and listen to it all the time. My favorite song is the one about Emma. The words to the songs on this CD are so inspiring and uplifting. I love them! This is definitely a must have to any inspirational music collection. 
 




  AWESOME!!!By Sandra J. E., Submitted on 2015-02-25I've seen the music from this CD performed in person and it was AWESOME!!! This is one of my favourite CD's to listen to. Absolutely beautiful and VERY touching music!!!
 




  It is definately in my top 3 favorite CDsBy Tyson, Submitted on 2015-02-25This CD has very uplifting songs, I loved them! They are the funnest and most exciting church songs you have ever listened to too. I recommend this CD to anyone who wants to have the spirit with them almost instantly! I hope they make some more CD's like this one. It was beautimous!
 




  Get It! Get It! Get it!By Shannon, Submitted on 2015-02-25This has got to be the best, most inpired piece of work I have ever listened to (and we own a lot of LDS music)! Our family simply cannot put it down. The tunes are catchy, the message divine, and I have gained a whole new love and appreciation for the Prophet Joseph. I shared it with a non-member coworker with whom I'm sharing the gospel - he couldn't put it down either! This is a must have for any collection.
