As a result of several factors which may include changing interest rates, refundings, and sales or defaults on the underlying securities, there is no guarantee that distributions will either remain at current levels or increase over time. Estimated current return is determined by dividing a Trusts estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price per unit. Estimated long-term return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of a Trust. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long-term return reflects maturities, estimated principal prepayments, Trust charges and expenses, and discounts and premiums of securities in a Trust. Returns and prices will fluctuate. Consult a prospectus for a more complete description of the estimated net income, estimated current return and estimated long-term return calculations.





This product information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer.  Sales of any of these securities must include prospectus delivery and the services of a retail broker/dealer duly licensed in the appropriate states.

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES 157   
THE FIRST TRUST OF INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS, SERIES 209  
7,782 UNITS   
PROSPECTUS                                                                      
Part One                                                                        
Dated June 29, 1999                                                             

Note: Part One of this Prospectus may not be distributed unless accompanied by  
Part Two and Part Three.                                            

In the opinion of Counsel, interest income to the Trust and to Unit holders,    
with certain exceptions, is exempt under existing law from all Federal income   
taxes, but may be subject to state and local taxes.  Capital gains, if any,     
are subject to tax.                                                             

The Trust                                                                       

The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds, Series 209 (the "Trust") is an      
insured and fixed portfolio of interest-bearing obligations issued by or on     
behalf of municipalities and other governmental authorities, the interest on    
which is, in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing              
governmental authorities, exempt from all Federal income taxes under existing   
law.  At May 17, 1999, each Unit represented a 1/7,782 undivided interest in    
the principal and net income of the Trust (see "The Fund" in Part Two).         

The Units being offered by this Prospectus are issued and outstanding Units     
which have been purchased by the Sponsor in the secondary market or from the    
Trustee after having been tendered for redemption.  The profit or loss          
resulting from the sale of Units will accrue to the Sponsor.  No proceeds from  
the sale of Units will be received by the Trust.                                

Public Offering Price                                                           

The Public Offering Price of the Units is equal to the aggregate value of the   
Bonds in the Portfolio of the Trust divided by the number of Units              
outstanding, plus a sales charge of 4.4% of the Public Offering Price (4,603%   
of the amount invested).  At May 17, 1999, the Public Offering Price per Unit   
was $1,053.13 plus net interest accrued to date of settlement (three business   
days after such date) of $10.06 and $35.95 for the monthly and semi-annual      
distribution plans, respectively (see "Market for Units" in Part Two).          

Please retain all parts of this Prospectus for future reference.

ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL  
OFFENSE.

Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return                         

Estimated Current Return to Unit holders under the semi-annual distribution     
plan was 5.90% per annum on May 17, 1999, and 5.84% under the monthly           
distribution plan.  Estimated Long-Term Return to Unit holders under the semi-  
annual distribution plan was 3.76% per annum on May 17, 1999, and 3.70% under   
the monthly distribution plan.  Estimated Current Return is calculated by       
dividing the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public        
Offering Price.  Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula       
which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative   
weightings of the market values, yields (which take into account the            
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of all of the Bonds in the Trust and (2) takes into account a       
compounding factor and the expenses and sales charge associated with each Unit  
of the Trust.  Since the market values and estimated retirements of the Bonds   
and the expenses of the Trust will change, there is no assurance that the       
present Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return indicated       
above will be realized in the future.  Estimated Current Return and Estimated   
Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the calculation of the          
Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal  
returned while the Estimated Current Return calculations include only Net       
Annual Interest Income and Public Offering Price.  The above figures are based  
on estimated per Unit cash flows.  Estimated cash flows will vary with changes  
in fees and expenses, with changes in current interest rates, and with the      
principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, call, exchange or sale of the       
underlying Bonds.  See "What are Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-   
Term Return?" in Part Two.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  

The Unit Holders of The First Trust Combined                                    
Series 157, The First Trust of Insured Municipal                                
Bonds, Series 209                                                               

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,           
including the portfolio, of The First Trust Combined Series 157, The First      
Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds, Series 209 as of February 28, 1999, and the   
related statements of operations and changes in net assets for each of the      
three years in the period then ended.  These financial statements are the       
responsibility of the Trust's Sponsor.  Our responsibility is to express an     
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.                      

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to       
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of  
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our        
procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of February 28, 1999,   
by correspondence with the Trustee.  An audit also includes assessing the       
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as    
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe    
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                     

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of The First Trust Combined       
Series 157, The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds, Series 209 at February
28, 1999, and the results of its operations and changes in its net assets for   
each of the three years in the period then ended in conformity with generally   
accepted accounting principles.

THE FIRST TRUST OF INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS, SERIES 209  
NOTES TO PORTFOLIO  
February 28, 1999   

(a)   Shown under this heading are the year in which each issue of Bonds is     
initially redeemable and the redemption price in that year.  Unless 
   otherwise indicated, each issue continues to be redeemable at declining
    prices thereafter (but not below par value).  "S.F." indicates a sinking
fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.  In addition,
    certain bonds are sometimes redeemable in whole or in part other than by
operation of the stated redemption or sinking fund provisions under 
   specified unusual or extraordinary circumstances.  Approximately 71% of
  the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds in the Trust is subject to
call within five years.                                             

(b)   The ratings shown are those effective at February 28, 1999.               

(c)   Insurance has been obtained by the Bond issuer.                           

(d)   These Bonds have no stated interest rate ("zero coupon bonds") and,       
    accordingly, will have no periodic interest payments to the Trust.  Upon
    maturity, the holders of these Bonds are entitled to receive 100% of the
stated principal amount.  The Bonds were issued at an original issue
discount on the following dates and at the following percentages of 
their original principal amount:                                    

                                                                [Download Table]

(e)   This issue of Bonds is secured by, and payable from, escrowed U.S.        
Government securities.                                              

(f)   The Trust consists of thirteen obligations of issuers located in ten      
    states.  Three of the Bonds in the Trust, representing approximately 23%
    of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds in the Trust, are general
   obligations of a governmental entity.  The remaining issues are revenue
    bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are
divided by purpose of issue as follows:  Health Care, 2; Water and  
   Sewer, 4; Electric, 2; and Miscellaneous, 2.  Approximately 20% and 21%
of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds consist of water and 
  sewer revenue bonds and electric revenue bonds, respectively.  Each of
four bond issues represents 10% or more of the aggregate principal  
  amount of the Bonds in the Trust or a total of approximately 60%.  The
largest such issue represents approximately 19%.

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES 157   
THE FIRST TRUST OF INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS, SERIES 209  
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

1.  Significant accounting policies                                             

Security valuation -                                                            

Bonds are stated at values as determined by Securities Evaluation Service,      
Inc. (the Evaluator), certain shareholders of which are officers of the         
Sponsor.  The bond values are based on (1) current bid prices for the bonds     
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to    
those held by the Trust, (2) current bid prices for comparable bonds, (3)       
appraisal or (4) any combination of the above.                                  

Security cost -                                                                 

The Trust's cost of its portfolio is based on the offering prices of the bonds  
on the Date of Deposit, April 28, 1992.  The premium or discount (including     
original issue discount) existing at the Date of Deposit is not being           
amortized.  Realized gain (loss) from bond transactions is reported on an       
identified cost basis.  Sales and redemptions of bonds are recorded on the      
trade date.                                                                     

Federal income taxes -                                                          

The Trust is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes.  Each unit holder is  
considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust and,              
accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes.               

Expenses of the Trust -                                                         

The Trust pays a fee for Trustee services to The Chase Manhattan Bank which is  
based on $1.05 and $.55 per $1,000 principal amount of Bonds for those          
portions of the Trust under the monthly and semi-annual distribution plans,     
respectively.  Additionally, a fee of $2,987 annually is payable to the         
Evaluator and the Trust pays all related expenses of the Trustee, recurring     
financial reporting costs and an annual supervisory fee payable to an           
affiliate of the Sponsor.                                                       

2.  Unrealized appreciation and depreciation                                    

An analysis of net unrealized appreciation at February 28, 1999 follows:        

                                                                [Download Table]
                                                            
Unrealized appreciation                             $707,731
Unrealized depreciation                             (80,930)
                                                    ________

3.  Insurance                                                                   

The issuers of all bond issues in the Trust have acquired insurance coverage    
which provides for the payment, when due, of all principal and interest on      
those bonds (see Note (c) to Portfolio).  Such insurance coverage acquired by   
an issuer of bonds continues in force so long as the bonds are outstanding and  
the insurer remains in business.                                                

4.  Other information

The cost to initial investors of units of the Trust was based on the aggregate  
offering price of the bonds on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a       
sales charge of 4.9% of the public offering price which is equivalent to        
approximately 5.152% of the net amount invested.                                

Distributions of net interest income -                                          

Distributions of net interest income to unit holders are made monthly or semi-  
annually.  Such income distributions per unit, on an accrual basis, were as     
follows:

ARE SUBJECT TO TAX.                                                             

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES (the "Fund") consists of underlying             
separate unit investment trusts (the "Trusts"). The various trusts are          
collectively referred to herein as the "Trusts" while all Trusts that           
are not designated as "The First Trust Advantage" are sometimes                 
collectively referred to herein as the "Insured Trusts" and a Trust with        
the name designation of "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds,            
Discount Trust" or "The First Trust Advantage: Discount Trust" is               
sometimes referred to herein as a "Discount Trust." Each Trust consists         
of a portfolio of interest-bearing obligations, issued by or on behalf          
of states and territories of the United States, and political                   
subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the          
opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental                  
authorities, exempt from all Federal income taxes under existing law            
although interest on certain Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas,          
Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for            
purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax. In addition, the interest              
income of each Trust is, in the opinion of Special Counsel, exempt to           
the extent indicated from state and local income taxes when held by             
residents of the state in which the issuers of the Bonds in such Trust          
are located. The securities in a Discount Trust are acquired at prices          
which result in a Discount Trust portfolio, as a whole, being purchased         
at a deep discount from the aggregate par value of such Securities              
although a substantial portion of the Securities in a Discount Trust            
portfolio may be acquired at a premium over the par value of such               
Securities. All of the Bonds in an Intermediate Trust mature within 8 to        
12 years of the Initial Date of Deposit. All of the Bonds in a Short            
Intermediate Trust mature within 3 to 6 years of the Initial Date of            
Deposit. All of the Bonds in a Long Intermediate Trust mature within 10         
to 15 years of the Initial Date of Deposit. The portfolio for each              
Trust, essential information based thereon and financial statements,            
including a report of independent auditors relating to the series of the        
Fund offered hereby, are contained in Part One to which reference should        
be made for such information.                                                   

INSURANCE GUARANTEEING THE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST         
ON ALL BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO OF EACH INSURED TRUST HAS BEEN OBTAINED           
FROM FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY AND/OR Ambac Assurance                
CORPORATION (FORMERLY KNOWN AS AMBAC INDEMNITY CORPORATION) BY THE              
INSURED TRUSTS OR WAS DIRECTLY OBTAINED BY THE BOND ISSUER, THE                 
UNDERWRITERS, THE SPONSOR OR OTHERS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL DATE OF DEPOSIT        
FROM FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY, Ambac Assurance CORPORATION,         
OR OTHER INSURERS (THE "PREINSURED BONDS"). INSURANCE OBTAINED BY AN            
INSURED TRUST APPLIES ONLY WHILE BONDS ARE RETAINED IN SUCH TRUST, WHILE        
INSURANCE ON PREINSURED BONDS IS EFFECTIVE SO LONG AS SUCH BONDS ARE            
OUTSTANDING. PURSUANT TO AN IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENT OF FINANCIAL GUARANTY        
INSURANCE COMPANY, AND/OR Ambac Assurance CORPORATION IN THE EVENT OF A         
SALE OF A BOND INSURED UNDER AN INSURANCE POLICY OBTAINED BY AN INSURED         
TRUST, THE TRUSTEE HAS THE RIGHT TO OBTAIN PERMANENT INSURANCE FOR SUCH         
BOND UPON THE PAYMENT OF A SINGLE PREDETERMINED INSURANCE PREMIUM FROM          
THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF SUCH BOND. THE INSURANCE, IN EITHER CASE,           
RELATES ONLY TO THE BONDS IN THE INSURED TRUSTS AND NOT TO THE UNITS            
OFFERED HEREBY. AS A RESULT OF SUCH INSURANCE, THE UNITS OF EACH INSURED        
TRUST HAVE RECEIVED A RATING OF "AAA" BY STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS              
GROUP, A DIVISION OF MCGRAW-HILL, INC. ("STANDARD & POOR'S"). SEE "WHY 
AND HOW ARE THE INSURED TRUSTS INSURED?" ON PAGE 10. NO REPRESENTATION          
IS MADE AS TO ANY INSURER'S ABILITY TO MEET ITS COMMITMENTS.                    
ALL PARTS OF THE PROSPECTUS SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.            

All Parts of the Prospectus Should be Retained for Future Reference.        

THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES        
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY         
OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A         
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.                                                               

Page 1                                                                          

For convenience the Prospectus is divided into sections which give              
general information about the Fund and specific information such as the         
public offering price, distributions and tax status for each Trust.             

The Objectives of the Fund are conservation of capital through                  
investment in portfolios of tax-exempt bonds and income exempt from             
Federal and applicable state and local income taxes although interest on        
certain Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and        
Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for purposes of the Federal           
Alternative Minimum Tax. ACCORDINGLY, CERTAIN ARKANSAS, IDAHO, KANSAS,          
MAINE, MISSISSIPPI AND NEBRASKA TRUSTS MAY BE APPROPRIATE ONLY FOR              
INVESTORS WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX. CERTAIN           
BONDS IN THE OKLAHOMA TRUSTS ARE SUBJECT TO OKLAHOMA STATE INCOME TAXES.        
The payment of interest and the preservation of principal are, of               
course, dependent upon the continuing ability of the issuers, obligors          
and/or insurers to meet their respective obligations.                           

Distributions to Unit holders may be reinvested as described herein. See        
"Rights of Unit Holders-How Can Distributions to Unit Holders be                
Reinvested?"                                                                    

The Sponsor, although not obligated to do so, intends to maintain a             
market for the Units at prices based upon the aggregate bid price of the        
Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust. In the absence of such a market, a        
Unit holder will nonetheless be able to dispose of the Units through            
redemption at prices based upon the bid prices of the underlying Bonds.         
See "Rights of Unit Holders-How May Units be Redeemed?" With respect to         
each Insured Trust, neither the bid nor offering prices of the                  
underlying Bonds or of the Units, absent situations in which Bonds are          
in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of        
such default, include value attributable to the portfolio insurance             
obtained by such Trust. See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?"       

Page 2                                                                          

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES       

What is The First Trust Combined Series?                                        

The First Trust Combined Series (the "Fund") is one of a series of              
investment companies created by the Sponsor under the name of The First         
Trust Combined Series, all of which are generally similar but each of           
which is separate and is designated by a different series number. This          
Series consists of underlying separate unit investment trusts (such             
Trusts being collectively referred to herein as the "Fund"). Each Series        
was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust         
Agreement (the "Indenture"), dated the Initial Date of Deposit, with            
Nike Securities L.P., as Sponsor, The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee,         
Securities Evaluation Service, Inc., as Evaluator and First Trust               
Advisors L.P., as Portfolio Supervisor. Only Units of a National Trust          
may be offered for sale to residents of the State of Illinois. Only             
Units of an Indiana Trust and/or a National Trust may be offered for            
sale to residents of the State of Indiana. Only Units of a Virginia             
Trust and/or a National Trust may be offered for sale to residents of           
the State of Virginia. Only Units of a Washington Trust and/or a                
National Trust may be offered for sale to residents of Washington. On           
the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee             
interest-bearing obligations, including delivery statements relating to         
contracts for the purchase of certain such obligations and irrevocable          
letters of credit issued by a financial institution in the amounts              
required for such purchases (the "Bonds"). The Trustee thereafter               
credited the account of the Sponsor for Units of each Trust representing        
the entire ownership of the Fund which Units are being offered hereby.          

The objectives of the Fund are Federal tax-exempt income and state and          
local tax-exempt income and conservation of capital through investment          
in portfolios of interest-bearing obligations issued by or on behalf of         
the state for which such Trust is named (collectively, the "State               
Trusts"), and counties, municipalities, authorities and political               
subdivisions thereof, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other                 
territories or municipalities of the United States, or authorities or           
political subdivisions thereof, the interest on which obligations is, in        
the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental              
authorities, exempt from all Federal income tax and, where applicable,          
state and local taxes under existing law although interest on certain           
Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and                
Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for purposes of the                   
Alternative Minimum Tax and certain Bonds in the Oklahoma Trusts are            
subject to Oklahoma State Income Taxes. The current market value of             
certain of the obligations in a Discount Trust were significantly below         
face value when the obligations were acquired by such Trust. The prices         
at which the obligations are acquired result in a Discount Trust's              
portfolio, as a whole, being purchased at a deep discount from the              
aggregate par value of such Securities although a substantial portion of        
the Securities in a Discount Trust portfolio may be acquired at a               
premium over the par value of such Securities. Insurance guaranteeing           
the scheduled payment of all principal and interest on Bonds in the             
Trusts with the name designation of "The First Trust of Insured                 
Municipal Bonds," "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-                  
Intermediate" or "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-Multi-             
State" (the "Insured Trusts") has been obtained by such Trusts from             
Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("Financial Guaranty") and/or Ambac        
Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance") or was obtained directly by           
the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others prior to the           
Initial Date of Deposit from Financial Guaranty, Ambac Assurance, or            
other insurers (the "Preinsured Bonds"). NO PORTFOLIO INSURANCE POLICY          
HAS BEEN OBTAINED BY THE TRUSTS WITH THE NAME DESIGNATION OF "THE FIRST         
TRUST ADVANTAGE" (THE "ADVANTAGE TRUSTS").  The portfolio insurance             
obtained by the Insured Trusts is effective only while the Bonds thus           
insured are held in such Trusts, while insurance on Preinsured Bonds is         
effective so long as such Bonds are outstanding. See "Why and How are
the Insured Trusts Insured?" THERE IS, OF COURSE, NO GUARANTEE THAT THE         
FUND'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACHIEVED. AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND SHOULD BE         
MADE WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS WHICH AN INVESTMENT IN FIXED            
RATE LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS MAY ENTAIL, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT THE         
VALUE OF THE UNITS WILL DECLINE WITH INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES.               

Neither the Public Offering Price of the Units of an Insured Trust nor          
any evaluation of such Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions         
reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by such Trust          
unless Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in           
significant risk of such default. See "Public Offering-How is the Public
Offering Price Determined?" On the other hand, the value of insurance           

Page 3                                                                          

obtained by the Bond issuer, the Sponsor or others is reflected and             
included in the market value of such Bonds.                                     

Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust or by the Bond issuer, the               
Sponsor or others is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer,        
but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security            
therefor. If an issue is accepted for insurance, a noncancelable policy         
for the scheduled payment of interest and principal on the Bonds is             
issued by the insurer. A single premium is paid by the Bond issuer, the         
underwriters, the Sponsor or others for Preinsured Bonds and a monthly          
premium is paid by each Insured Trust for the insurance obtained by such        
Trust except for Bonds in such Trust which are insured by the Bond              
issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others in which case no                
premiums for insurance are paid by such Trust. Upon the sale of a Bond          
insured under the insurance policy obtained by an Insured Trust, the            
Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from Financial              
Guaranty and/or Ambac Assurance with respect to such Bond upon the              
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of        
the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in an Insured Trust of the         
Fund is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. Standard & Poor's and          
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. have rated the claims-paying ability of         
Financial Guaranty and Ambac Assurance "AAA" and "Aaa," respectively.           
See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?"                               

In selecting Bonds, the following facts, among others, were considered:         
(i) the Standard & Poor's rating or Fitch Investors Service, Inc.'s             
rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "BBB" in the case of an            
Insured Trust (or an Arkansas, Kansas or Maine Advantage Trust) and "A-"        
in the case of other Advantage Trusts, or the Moody's Investors Service,        
Inc. rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "Baa" in the case of          
an Insured Trust (or an Arkansas, Kansas or Maine Advantage Trust) and          
"A" in the case of other Advantage Trusts, including provisional or             
conditional ratings, respectively, or, if not rated, the Bonds had, in          
the opinion of the Sponsor, credit characteristics sufficiently similar         
to the credit characteristics of interest-bearing tax-exempt obligations        
that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the Fund (see         
"Description of Bond Ratings"); (ii) the prices of the Bonds relative to        
other bonds of comparable quality and maturity; (iii) with respect to           
the Insured Trusts, the availability and cost of insurance of the               
principal and interest on the Bonds and (iv) the diversification of             
Bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer. Subsequent to the          
Initial Date of Deposit, a Bond may cease to be rated or its rating may         
be reduced below the minimum required as of the Initial Date of Deposit.        
Neither event requires elimination of such Bond from the portfolio, but         
may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to        
direct the Trustee to dispose of the Bond. See "Rights of Unit Holders-         
How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?" The Portfolio appearing in Part        
One contains Bond ratings, when available, for the Bonds listed at the          
date shown.                                                                     

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may have been acquired at a market           
discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on the           
discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the             
Trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued        
bonds of comparable rating and type. The market discount of previously          
issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued                 
comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall,           
other things being equal. A discount bond held to maturity will have a          
larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and            
capital gain and less in the form of tax-exempt interest income than a          
comparable bond newly issued at current market rates. See "What is the
Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?" appearing in Part Three for each           
Trust.                                                                          

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be original issue discount bonds.        
Under current law, the original issue discount, which is the difference         
between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of          
the Bonds, is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion         
is treated as tax-exempt interest income for Federal income tax                 
purposes. On sale or redemption, any gain realized that is in excess of         
the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital        
gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case           
the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income. See             
"What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?" appearing in Part             
Three for each Trust. The current value of an original discount bond            
reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity.          
The market value tends to increase in greater increments as the Bonds           
approach maturity.                                                              

Certain of the original issue discount bonds may be Zero Coupon Bonds           
(including bonds known as multiplier bonds, money multiplier bonds,             

Page 4                                                                          

capital appreciation bonds, capital accumulator bonds, compound interest        
bonds and money discount maturity payment bonds). Zero Coupon Bonds do          
not provide for the payment of any current interest and generally               
provide for payment at maturity at face value unless sooner sold or             
redeemed. Zero Coupon bond features include (1) not paying interest on a        
semi-annual basis and (2) providing for the reinvestment of the bond's          
semi-annual earnings at the bond's stated yield to maturity. While Zero         
Coupon Bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate         
of return minimizes reinvestment risk, this benefit can be negated in           
large part by weak call protection.                                             

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may have been acquired at a market           
premium from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on the            
premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the              
Trusts were higher than the current market interest rates for newly             
issued bonds of comparable rating and type. The current returns of bonds        
trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current               
returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently               
prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in             
market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes             
payable. Because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at             
maturity but through current income payments, early redemption of a             
premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a          
reduction in yield. Redemptions are more likely to occur at times when          
the Bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium            
over par, or for original issue discount Bonds, a premium over the              
accreted value. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in the Fund         
at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will          
represent a loss of capital when compared to the original Public                
Offering Price of the Units. Because premium bonds generally pay a              
higher rate of interest than bonds priced at or below par, the effect of        
the redemption of premium bonds would be to reduce Estimated Net Annual         
Unit Income by a greater percentage than the par amount of such bonds           
bears to the total par amount of Bonds in the Trust. Although the actual        
impact of any such redemptions that may occur will depend upon the              
specific Bonds that are redeemed, it can be anticipated that the                
Estimated Net Annual Unit Income will be significantly reduced after the        
dates on which such Bonds are eligible for redemption. The Trust may be         
required to sell Zero Coupon Bonds prior to maturity (at their current          
market price which is likely to be less than their par value) in order          
to pay expenses of the Trust or in case the Trust is terminated. See            
"Rights of Unit Holders-How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?" and            
"Other Information-How May the Indenture be Amended or Terminated?"             

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be general obligations of a              
governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity.         
All other Bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income         
of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's        
power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are secured by the                
issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of        
principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable           
only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of           
facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax         
or other specific revenue source. There are, of course, variations in           
the security of the different Bonds in the Fund, both within a                  
particular classification and between classifications, depending on             
numerous factors.                                                               

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be healthcare revenue bonds.             
Healthcare revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are          
primarily derived from services provided by hospitals or other                  
healthcare facilities, including nursing homes. A healthcare issuer's           
ability to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent         
on various factors, including occupancy levels of the facility, demand,         
government regulations, wages of employees, overhead expenses,                  
competition from other similar providers, malpractice insurance costs           
and the degree of governmental competition from other similar providers,        
malpractice insurance costs and the degree of governmental financial            
assistance, including Medicare and Medicaid and other similar third-            
party payer programs.                                                           

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be housing revenue bonds. Housing        
revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily           
derived from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing              
projects for low to moderate income families. Housing revenue bonds are         
generally payable at any time and therefore their average life will             
ordinarily be less than their stated maturities. The ability of such            
issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent         
on various factors, including occupancy levels, rental income, mortgage         
default rates, taxes, operating expenses, governmental regulations and          
the appropriation of subsidies.                                                 

Page 5                                                                          

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers whose          
revenues are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services.           
Water and sewerage bonds are generally payable from user fees. Problems         
faced by such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate         
rate increases, population decline resulting in decreased user fees, the        
difficulty of financing large construction programs, the limitations on         
operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental         
considerations, the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering           
new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation programs and the        
impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.                                        

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers whose          
revenues are primarily derived from the sale of electric energy.                
Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility        
commissions which, among other things, establish the rates which may be         
charged and the appropriate rate of return. The problems faced by such          
issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and             
adequate rate increases from the governing public utility commission,           
the difficulty in financing large construction programs, increased              
federal, state and municipal government regulations, the limitations on         
operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental         
considerations, increased competition, recent reductions in estimates of        
future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country, the              
difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt, the                 
difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of             
energy conservation.                                                            

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be lease obligations issued              
primarily by governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other        
means of directly raising revenues. Rather, the governmental authorities        
are financing vehicles created solely for the construction of buildings         
(i.e., schools, administrative offices, convention centers and prisons)         
or the purchase of equipment (i.e., police cars and computer systems)           
that will be used by a state or local government (the "lessee"). These          
obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee            
government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service         
on the obligations. Lease obligations are subject, in almost all cases,         
to annual appropriation risk, i.e., the lessee government is not legally        
obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the          
current fiscal year, or construction and abatement risk-rental                  
obligations cease in the event that delays in building, damage,                 
destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the              
lessee.                                                                         

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be industrial revenue bonds              
("IRBs"), tax-exempt securities issued by states, municipalities, public        
authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring,               
constructing or improving various industrial projects. Debt service             
payments on IRBs are dependent on various factors, including the                
creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and, if               
applicable, corporate guarantor, revenues generated from the project            
and, if applicable, corporate guarantor, revenues generated from the            
project and regulatory and environmental restrictions.                          

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations which are payable         
from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of        
facilities such as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities,              
convention centers and arenas. The ability of issuers to make debt              
service payments on airport obligations is dependent on the capability          
of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to              
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other             
factors, many airlines may have difficulty meeting their obligations            
under these use agreements. Similarly, payment on Bonds related to other        
facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects, such as user fees        
from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings.            
Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues           
due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance, decreased use of a        
facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, scarcity of        
fuel and reduction or loss of rents.                                            

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers which          
govern the operation of schools, colleges and universities and whose            
revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes. General problems             
relating to college and university obligations would include the                
prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of              
"college" age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees        
sufficiently to cover increased operating costs, the uncertainty of             
continued receipt of Federal grants and state funding and new government        
legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or           
costs of such issuers.                                                          

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations which are payable         
from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource             
recovery facilities. Resource recovery facilities are designed to               

Page 6                                                                          

process solid waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity.           
Resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional                
redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances,                 
including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation of a project;         
contracts relating to a project becoming void, unenforceable or                 
impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of raw              
materials, operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation         
of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely            
affecting the operation of a project; administrative or judicial actions        
which render contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or          
impossible to perform; or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive              
liabilities.                                                                    

Certain Trusts may contain Bonds of issuers located in the Commonwealth         
of Puerto Rico or issuers which will be affected by general economic            
conditions of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's unemployment rate remains              
significantly higher than the U.S. unemployment rate. Furthermore, the          
economy is largely dependent for its development upon U.S. policies and         
programs that are being reviewed and may be eliminated.                         

Economic activity in Puerto Rico increased again during 1998. The growth        
in Puerto Rico's gross domestic product (GDP) was 3%, with an additional        
2.7% growth expected in 1999. The main driving force behind this growth         
was manufacturing, Puerto Rico's largest and most quickly developing            
economic sector, accounting for more than 55% of the territory's GDP            
during 1998. Manufacturing exports have increased more than 35% during          
the past five years to $23.4 billion in 1998, due in part to increasing         
emphasis on rebuilding Puerto Rico's infrastructure, including the              
upcoming renovation of the Port of San Juan.                                    

Puerto Rico's unemployment, although at relatively low historical               
levels, remains above the average for the United States. Average total          
employment increased from 1.01 million in 1993 to 1.14 million in 1998,         
with 11.4% growth during this five-year period. Non-farm employment (not        
seasonally adjusted) for January 1999 reached 1,158,138, its highest            
recorded level. The average unemployment rate decreased from 17.0% in           
1993 to 13.3% in 1998 and dropped further to 12.7% in March 1999. The           
U.S. average in 1998 was 4.5%.                                                  

The territory has experienced $1.9 billion in general fund revenue              
growth during the past five years, totaling a $1.9 billion increase             
between fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1998, more than 67%          
of Puerto Rico's $5.9 billion in general fund receipts were due to the          
income tax, with excise taxes accounting for another 22%. Long-term debt        
for the territory reached $14.7 billion at the end of fiscal 1998 (ended        
June 30, 1998). Outstanding general obligation debt accounted for $4.8          
billion of this amount, while revenue bonds represented $5.2 billion.           

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of           
the financial difficulties which may impact certain issuers of Bonds and        
does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all              
adverse conditions to which the issuers of the Bonds are subject.               
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and              
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control         
of the issuers of Bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on        
the financial condition of Puerto Rico and various agencies and                 
political subdivisions located in Puerto Rico. The Sponsor is unable to         
predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may             
affect the issuers of Bonds, the market value or marketability of the           
Bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of the Bonds acquired by         
the Trusts to pay interest on or principal of the Bonds.                        

Interest on certain of the Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas,            
Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts will be an item of tax preference        
for purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT"). The investment by          
non-AMT individual taxpayers in AMT municipal bonds generally results in        
a higher yield to such bondholders than non-AMT municipal bonds. Since a        
portion of the interest from certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine,            
Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts is an AMT preference item, certain              
Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts may be          
more appropriate for investors who are not subject to AMT.                      

Investors should be aware that many of the Bonds in the Trusts are              
subject to continuing requirements such as the actual use of Bond               
proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed from Bond               
proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on such Bonds from           
Federal income taxation. Although at the time of issuance of each of the        
Bonds in the Trusts an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the           
exemption of interest on such obligations from Federal income taxation,         
there can be no assurance that the respective issuers or other obligors         

Page 7                                                                          

on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements            
established upon issuance of the Bonds. A failure to comply with such           
requirements may cause a determination that interest on such obligations        
is subject to Federal income taxation, perhaps even retroactively from          
the date of issuance of such Bonds, thereby reducing the value of the           
Bonds and subjecting Unit holders to unanticipated tax liabilities.             

Because certain of the Bonds may from time to time under certain                
circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with             
their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be                   
distributed to Unit holders and will not be reinvested, no assurance can        
be given that a Trust will retain for any length of time its present            
size and composition. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be              
liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any Bond.               
Certain of the Bonds contained in the Trusts may be subject to being            
called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities         
pursuant to optional redemption provisions, sinking fund provisions,            
special or extraordinary redemption provisions or otherwise. A bond             
subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or               
refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A bond subject         
to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from         
time to time at par or, in the case of a zero coupon bond, at the               
accreted value from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a        
portion of an issue prior to maturity. Special or extraordinary                 
redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par (or for original        
issue discount bonds at issue price plus the amount of original issue           
discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some premium)         
of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain                  
circumstances. The exercise of redemption or call provisions will               
(except to the extent the proceeds of the called Bonds are used to pay          
for Unit redemptions) result in the distribution of principal and may           
result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest                      
distributions; it may also affect the long-term return and the current          
return on Units of each Trust. Redemption pursuant to call provisions is        
more likely to occur, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions        
may occur, when the Bonds have an offering side valuation which                 
represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a            
premium over the accreted value. Unit holders may recognize capital gain        
or loss upon any redemption or call.                                            

Like other investment companies, financial and business organizations           
and individuals around the world, the Fund could be adversely affected          
if the computer systems used by the Sponsor, Evaluator, Portfolio               
Supervisor or Trustee or other service providers to the Fund do not             
properly process and calculate date-related information and data                
involving dates of January 1, 2000 and thereafter. This is commonly             
known as the "Year 2000 Problem." The Sponsor, Evaluator, Portfolio             
Supervisor and Trustee are taking steps that they believe are reasonably        
designed to address the Year 2000 Problem with respect to computer              
systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that                  
comparable steps are being taken by the Fund's other service providers.         
At this time, however, there can be no assurance that these steps will          
be sufficient to avoid any adverse impact to the Fund. The Sponsor is           
unable to predict what impact, if any, the Year 2000 Problem will have          
on issuers of the Bonds contained in the Fund.                                  

To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending as         
of the date hereof in respect of any Bonds which might reasonably be            
expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Trusts. At any time         
after the date hereof, litigation may be initiated on a variety of              
grounds with respect to Bonds in a Trust. Such litigation, as for               
example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue             
bonds under recently-enacted environmental protection statutes, may             
affect the validity of such Bonds or the tax-free nature of the interest        
thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be            
entirely predicted, the Fund has received opinions of bond counsel to           
the issuing authority of each Bond on the date of issuance to the effect        
that such Bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon          
is exempt from Federal income taxes and state and local taxes. In               
addition, other factors may arise from time to time which potentially           
may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with           
respect to the Bonds.                                                           

What are Estimated Long-Term Return and Estimated Current Return?               

At the date of this Prospectus, the Estimated Current Return and the            
Estimated Long-Term Return, under the monthly, quarterly (if applicable)        
and semi-annual (if applicable) distribution plans, are as set forth in         
Part One attached hereto for each Trust. Estimated Current Return is            
computed by dividing the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit          
by the Public Offering Price. Any change in either amount will result in        

Page 8                                                                          

a change in the Estimated Current Return. For each Trust, the Public            
Offering Price will vary in accordance with fluctuations in the prices          
of the underlying Bonds and the Net Annual Interest Income per Unit will        
change as Bonds are redeemed, paid, sold or exchanged in certain                
refundings or as the expenses of each Trust change. Therefore, there is         
no assurance that the Estimated Current Return indicated in Part One for        
each Trust will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is        
calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and               
determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values,         
yields (which take into account the amortization of premiums and the            
accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of all of the Bonds in        
the Trust and (2) takes into account a compounding factor, the expenses         
and sales charge associated with each Unit of a Trust. Since the market         
values and estimated retirements of the Bonds and the expenses of the           
Trust will change, there is no assurance that the Estimated Long-Term           
Return indicated in Part One for each Trust will be realized in the             
future. Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are             
expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return        
reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while              
Estimated Current Return calculations include only Net Annual Interest          
Income and Public Offering Price. Neither rate reflects the true return         
to Unit holders, which is lower, because neither includes the effect of         
certain delays in distributions to Unit holders.                                

A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current               
returns and estimated long-term returns with the returns on various             
taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment          
decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales        
materials compare the then current estimated returns on the Trust and           
returns over specified periods on other similar Trusts sponsored by Nike        
Securities L.P. with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or        
U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and money market accounts or money              
market funds, each of which has investment characteristics that may             
differ from those of the Trust.                                                 

How are Purchased Interest and Accrued Interest Treated?                        

Purchased Interest. For The First Trust Combined Series 198-208, each           
Trust contains an amount of Purchased Interest. Purchased Interest is a         
portion of the unpaid interest that has accrued on the Bonds from the           
later of the last payment date on the Bonds or the date of issuance             
thereof through the First Settlement Date and is included in the                
calculation of the Public Offering Price. Purchased Interest will be            
distributed to Unit holders as Units are redeemed or Securities are             
sold, mature or are called. See "Summary of Essential Information"              
appearing in Part One for each Trust for the amount of Purchased                
Interest per Unit for each Trust. Purchased Interest is an element of           
the determination of the price Unit holders will receive in connection          
with the sale or redemption of Units prior to the termination of the            
Trust.                                                                          

Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid                
interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid.        
Interest on Bonds generally is paid semi-annually, although each Trust          
accrues such interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an             
amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this        
reason, with respect to sales settling subsequent to the First                  
Settlement Date, the Public Offering Price of Units will have added to          
it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of                   
settlement. Unit holders will receive on the next distribution date of          
the Trust the amount, if any, of accrued interest paid on their Units.          

For The First Trust Combined Series 1-197, except through an advancement        
of its own funds, the Trustee has no cash for distribution to Unit              
holders until it receives interest payments on the Bonds in a Trust. The        
Trustee will recover its advancements without interest or other costs to        
such Trust from interest received on the Bonds in the Trust. When these         
advancements have been recovered, regular distributions of interest to          
Unit holders will commence. See "Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest        
and Principal Distributed?" Interest account balances are established           
with generally positive cash balances so that it will not be necessary          
on a regular basis for the Trustee to advance its own funds in                  
connection with interest distributions.                                         

For The First Trust Combined Series 198-208, in an effort to reduce the         
amount of Purchased Interest which would otherwise have to be paid by           
Unit holders, the Trustee may advance a portion of the accrued interest         
to the Sponsor as the Unit holder of record as of the First Settlement          
Date. Consequently, the amount of accrued interest to be added to the           
Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued interest from          
the First Settlement Date to the date of settlement (other than the             
Purchased Interest already included therein), less any distributions            

Page 9                                                                          

from the Interest Account subsequent to the First Settlement Date. See          
"Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest and Principal Distributed?"            

For The First Trust Combined Series 209 and subsequent Series, in an            
effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise           
have to be paid in addition to the Public Offering Price in the sale of         
Units to the public, the Trustee will advance the amount of accrued             
interest as of the First Settlement Date and the same will be                   
distributed to the Sponsor as the Unit holder of record as of the First         
Settlement Date. Consequently, the amount of accrued interest to be             
added to the Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued           
interest from the First Settlement Date to the date of settlement, less         
any distributions from the Interest Account subsequent to the First             
Settlement Date. See "Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest and               
Principal Distributed?"                                                         

Because of the varying interest payment dates of the Bonds, accrued             
interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of                
interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unit holders.          
If a Unit holder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he will        
be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the Purchased Interest        
(if any) and accrued interest from the purchaser of his Units. Since the        
Trustee has the use of the funds (including Purchased Interest, if any)         
held in the Interest Account for distributions to Unit holders and since        
such Account is non-interest-bearing to Unit holders, the Trustee               
benefits thereby.                                                               

Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO THE INSURED TRUSTS. THE          
BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO OF AN ADVANTAGE TRUST ARE NOT INSURED BY                 
INSURANCE OBTAINED BY THE FUND.                                                 

All Bonds in the portfolio of an Insured Trust are insured as to the            
scheduled payment of interest and principal by policies obtained by each        
Insured Trust from Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("Financial             
Guaranty" or "FGIC"), a New York stock insurance company, or Ambac              
Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance" or "Ambac"), a Wisconsin-              
domiciled stock insurance company, or obtained by the Bond issuer, the          
underwriters, the Sponsor or others prior to the Initial Date of Deposit        
directly from Financial Guaranty, Ambac Assurance or other insurers (the        
"Preinsured Bonds"). The insurance policy obtained by each Insured Trust        
is noncancellable and will continue in force for such Trust so long as          
such Trust is in existence and the Bonds described in the policy                
continue to be held by such Trust (see "Portfolio" for each Insured             
Trust). The terms governing outstanding and existing policies remain            
effective regardless of whether the insurer changes its name or sells           
its assets. Nonpayment of premiums on the policy obtained by each               
Insured Trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance, but will        
permit Financial Guaranty and/or Ambac Assurance to take action against         
the Trustee to recover premium payments due it. Premium rates for each          
issue of Bonds protected by the policy obtained by each Insured Trust           
are fixed for the life of such Trust. The premium for any Preinsured            
Bonds has been paid in advance by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the        
Sponsor or others and any such policy or policies are noncancellable and        
will continue in force so long as the Bonds so insured are outstanding          
and the insurer and/or insurers thereof remain in business. If the              
provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its         
obligations under such policy, or if the rating assigned to the claims-         
paying ability of such insurer deteriorates, Financial Guaranty and/or          
Ambac Assurance has no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected        
by either of the above described events. A monthly premium is paid by           
each Insured Trust for the insurance obtained by such Trust, which is           
payable from the interest income received by such Trust. In the case of         
Preinsured Bonds, no premiums for insurance are paid by the Insured Trust.      

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. Under the provisions of the               
aforementioned portfolio insurance issued by Financial Guaranty,                
Financial Guaranty unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to             
Citibank, N.A., or its successor, as its agent (the "Fiscal Agent"),            
that portion of the principal of and interest on the Bonds covered by           
the policy which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by            
reason of nonpayment by the issuer of the Bonds. The term "due for              
payment" means, when referring to the principal of a Bond, its stated           
maturity date or the date on which it shall have been called for                
mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to any earlier date        
on which payment is due by reason of call for redemption (other than by         
mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration or other advancement of        
maturity and means, when referring to interest on a Bond, the stated            
date for payment of interest, except that when the interest on a Bond           
shall have been determined, as provided in the underlying documentation         
relating to such Bond, to be subject to Federal income taxation, "due           
for payment" also means, when referring to the principal of such Bond,          
the date on which such Bond has been called for mandatory redemption as         
a result of such determination of taxability, and when referring to             
interest on such Bond, the accrued interest at the rate provided in such        
documentation to the date on which such Bond has been called for such           
mandatory redemption, together with any applicable redemption premium.          
The term "due for payment" will not include, when referring to either           

Page 10                                                                         

the principal of a Bond or the interest on a Bond, any acceleration of          
payment unless such acceleration is at the sole option of Financial             
Guaranty.                                                                       

Financial Guaranty will make such payments to the Fiscal Agent on the           
date such principal or interest becomes due for payment or on the               
business day next following the day on which Financial Guaranty shall           
have received notice of nonpayment, whichever is later. The Fiscal Agent        
will disburse to the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest          
which is then due for payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by          
the issuer but only upon receipt by the Fiscal Agent of (i) evidence of         
the Trustee's right to receive payment of the principal or interest due         
for payment and (ii) evidence, including any appropriate instruments of         
assignment, that all of the rights to payment of such principal or              
interest due for payment shall thereupon vest in Financial Guaranty.            
Upon such disbursement, Financial Guaranty shall become the owner of the        
Bond, appurtenant coupon or right to payment of principal or interest on        
such Bond and shall be fully subrogated to all of the Trustee's rights          
thereunder, including the right to payment thereof.                             

Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of Financial Guaranty, the                
Trustee, upon the sale of a Bond covered under a policy obtained by an          
Insured Trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect          
to such Bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the Bonds regardless of the        
identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the            
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of        
the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in an Insured Trust is             
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee        
will exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such         
exercise the Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of Bond             
proceeds less the insurance premium attributable to the Permanent               
Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such Bonds          
were sold on an uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to          
each Bond eligible for Permanent Insurance is determined based upon the         
insurability of each Bond as of the Initial Date of Deposit and will not        
be increased or decreased for any change in the creditworthiness of such        
Bond.                                                                           

Financial Guaranty is a wholly-owned subsidiary of FGIC Corporation (the        
"Corporation"), a Delaware holding company. The Corporation is a wholly-

Neither the Corporation nor GECC is obligated to pay the debts of or the        
claims against Financial Guaranty. Financial Guaranty is a monoline

Ambac Assurance Corporation ("Ambac Assurance"). Effective July 14,
1997, AMBAC Indemnity Corporation changed its name to Ambac Assurance           
Corporation. The Insurance Policy of Ambac Assurance obtained by an             
Insured Trust is noncancellable and will continue in force for so long          
as the Bonds described in the Insurance Policy are held by an Insured           
Trust. A monthly premium is paid by an Insured Trust for the Insurance          
Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will pay, when due, successively, the        

Page 11                                                                         

full amount of each installment of the insurance premium. Pursuant to a         
binding agreement with Ambac Assurance, in the event of a sale of a Bond        
covered by the Ambac Assurance Insurance Policy, the Trustee has the            
right to obtain permanent insurance for such Bond upon payment of a             
single predetermined premium from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond.        

Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, Ambac Assurance agrees to pay          
to the Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the             
Bonds insured by Ambac Assurance which shall become due for payment but         
shall be unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer of the Bonds. The         
term "due for payment" means, when referring to the principal of a Bond         
so insured, its stated maturity date or the date on which it shall have         
been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to         
any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call for                  
redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption),                   
acceleration or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring         
to interest on a Bond, the stated date for payment of interest.                 

Ambac Assurance will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty          
days after notice from the Trustee is received by Ambac Assurance that a        
nonpayment of principal or of interest on a Bond has occurred, but not          
earlier than the date on which the Bonds are due for payment. Ambac             
Assurance will disburse to the Trustee the face amount of principal and         
interest which is then due for payment but is unpaid by reason of               
nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for delivery of Bonds, not less in         
face amount than the amount of the payment in bearer form, free and             
clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In cases where             
Bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to               
registered holders or their assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay principal        
only upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid Bonds uncancelled and        
free of any adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in         
satisfactory form, so as to permit ownership of such Bonds to be                
registered in the name of Ambac Assurance or its nominee. In cases where        
Bonds are issuable only in a form whereby interest is payable to                
registered holders or their assigns, Ambac Assurance shall pay interest         
only upon presentation of proof that the claimant is the person entitled        
to the payment of interest on the Bonds and delivery of an instrument of        
assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to Ambac Assurance all           
right under such Bonds to receive the interest in respect of which the          
insurance payment was made.

furnished by Ambac Assurance. No representation is made herein as to the        
accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any         
adverse changes in such information, subsequent to the date hereof.             

In determining whether to insure bonds, Financial Guaranty and/or Ambac         
Assurance has applied its own standards which are not necessarily the           
same as the criteria used in regard to the selection of bonds by the            
Sponsor. This decision is made prior to the Initial Date of Deposit, as         
bonds not covered by such insurance are not deposited in an Insured             
Trust, unless such bonds are Preinsured Bonds. The insurance obtained by        
an Insured Trust covers Bonds deposited in such Trust and physically            
delivered to the Trustee in the case of bearer bonds or registered in           
the name of the Trustee or its nominee or delivered along with an               
assignment in the case of registered bonds or registered in the name of         
the Trustee or its nominee in the case of Bonds held in book-entry form.        

Page 12                                                                         

Contracts to purchase Bonds are not covered by the insurance obtained by        
an Insured Trust although Bonds underlying such contracts are covered by        
insurance upon physical delivery to the Trustee.                                

Insurance obtained by each Insured Trust or by the Bond issuer, the             
underwriters, the Sponsor or others does not guarantee the market value         
of the Bonds or the value of the Units of such Trust. The insurance             
obtained by an Insured Trust is effective only as to Bonds owned by and         
held in such Trust. In the event of a sale of any such Bond by the              
Trustee, the insurance terminates as to such Bond on the date of sale.          
In the event of a sale of a Bond insured by an Insured Trust, the               
Trustee has the right to obtain Permanent Insurance upon the payment of         
an insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond. Except         
as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no effect        
on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention          
of the Evaluator to attribute a value to such insurance obtained by an          
Insured Trust (including the right to obtain Permanent Insurance) for           
the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of Units only if         
the Bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of                
principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant risk         
of such default. The value of the insurance will be equal to the                
difference between (i) the market value of a Bond which is in default in        
payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default         
assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less          
the insurance premium attributable to the purchase of Permanent                 
Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such Bonds not covered by               
Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering-How is the Public Offering
Price Determined?" herein for a more complete description of the                
Evaluator's method of valuing defaulted Bonds and Bonds which have a            
significant risk of default. Insurance on a Preinsured Bond is effective        
as long as such Bond is outstanding. Therefore, any such insurance may          
be considered to represent an element of market value in regard to the          
Bonds thus insured, but the exact effect, if any, of this insurance on          
such market value cannot be predicted.                                          

A contract of insurance obtained by an Insured Trust and the                    
negotiations in respect thereof represent the only relationship between         
Financial Guaranty and/or Ambac Assurance and the Fund. Otherwise               
neither Financial Guaranty nor its parent, FGIC Corporation, or any             
affiliate thereof, nor Ambac Assurance nor its parent, Ambac, Inc., or          
any affiliate thereof has any significant relationship, direct or               
indirect, with the Fund or the Sponsor, except that the Sponsor has in          
the past and may from time to time in the future, in the normal course          
of its business, participate as sole underwriter or as manager or as a          
member of underwriting syndicates in the distribution of new issues of          
municipal bonds in which the investors or the affiliates of FGIC                
Corporation and/or Ambac Inc. have or will be participants or for which         
a policy of insurance guaranteeing the scheduled payment of interest and        
principal has been obtained from Financial Guaranty and/or Ambac                
Assurance. Neither the Fund nor the Units of a Trust nor the portfolio          
of such Trust is insured directly or indirectly by FGIC Corporation             
and/or Ambac Inc.

Financial Security Assurance. Financial Security Assurance Inc.                 
("Financial Security") is a monoline insurance company incorporated in          
1984 under the laws of the State of New York. Financial Security is             
licensed to engage in the financial guaranty insurance business in all          
50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.                            

Financial Security and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of          
writing financial guaranty insurance, principally in respect of                 
securities offered in domestic and foreign markets. In general,                 
financial guaranty insurance consists of the issuance of a guaranty of          
scheduled payments of an issuer's securities, thereby enhancing the             
credit rating of those securities, in consideration for payment of a            
premium to the insurer. Financial Security and its subsidiaries                 
principally insure asset-backed, collateralized and municipal                   
securities. Asset-backed securities are generally supported by                  
residential mortgage loans, consumer or trade receivables, securities or        
other assets having an ascertainable cash flow or market value.                 
Collateralized securities include public utility first mortgage bonds           
and sale/leaseback obligation bonds. Municipal securities consist               
largely of general obligation bonds, special revenue bonds and other            
special obligations of state and local governments. Financial Security          
insures both newly issued securities sold in the primary market and             
outstanding securities sold in the secondary market that satisfy                
Financial Security's underwriting criteria.                                     

Financial Security is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security           
Assurance Holdings Ltd. ("Holdings"), a New York Stock Exchange listed          
company. Major shareholders of Holdings include Fund American                   
Enterprises Holdings, Inc., MediaOne Capital Corporation, XL Capital            
Ltd. and The Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. No shareholder of         
Financial Security is obligated to pay any debt of Financial Security or        
its subsidiaries or any claim under any insurance policy issued by              
Financial Security or its subsidiaries or to make any additional                
contribution to the capital of Financial Security or its subsidiaries.          
As of March 31, 1999, the total policyholders' surplus and contingency          
reserves and the total unearned premium reserve, respectively, of               
Financial Security and its consolidated subsidiaries were, in accordance        
with statutory accounting principles, approximately $1,077,088,000              
(unaudited) and $607,467,000 (unaudited), and the total shareholders'           
equity and the unearned premium reserve, respectively, of Financial             
Security and its consolidated subsidiaries were, in accordance with             
generally accepted accounting principles, approximately $1,138,741,000          
(unaudited), and $512,383,000 (unaudited). Copies of Financial                  
Security's financial statements may be obtained by writing to Financial         
Security at 350 Park Avenue, New York, New York, 10022, Attention               
Communications Department. Financial Security's telephone number is             
(212) 826-0100.

Pursuant to an intercompany agreement, liabilities on financial guaranty        
insurance written or reinsured from third parties by Financial Security         
or any of its operating insurance company subsidiaries are reinsured            
among such companies on an agreed-upon percentage substantially                 
proportional to their respective capital, surplus and reserves, subject         
to applicable statutory risk limitations. In addition, Financial                
Security reinsures a portion of its liabilities under certain of its            
financial guaranty insurance policies with other reinsurers under               
various quota share treaties and on a transaction-by-transaction basis.         
Such reinsurance is utilized as a risk management device and to comply          
with certain statutory and rating agency requirements; it does not alter        
or limit the obligations of Financial Security under any financial              
guaranty insurance policy.                                                      

The claims-paying ability of Financial Security is rated "Aaa" by               
Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and "AAA" by Standard & Poor's Rating          
Services, Nippon Investors Service Inc. and Standard & Poor's                   
(Australia) Pty. Ltd. Such ratings reflect only the views of the                
respective rating agencies, are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold        
securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by such        
rating agencies.                                                                

Connie Lee Insurance Company. On December 18, 1997, all of the                  
outstanding shares of Construction Loan Insurance Corporation (which            
previously owned all of the outstanding shares of Connie Lee Insurance          
Company) were merged into Connie Lee Holdings, Inc. ("Connie Lee").             
Connie Lee is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ambac Assurance Corporation,         
a Wisconsin-domiciled insurance company.                                        

As of December 31, 1998, the total policyholders' surplus of Connie Lee         
was $120,484,617 (unaudited) and total admitted assets were $234,425,505        
(unaudited), as reported to the Commissioner of Insurance of the State          
of Wisconsin in Connie Lee's financial statements prepared in accordance        
with statutory accounting principles applicable to insurance companies.         
Copies of these financial statements are available from Connie Lee upon         
request.                                                                        

Standard & Poor's has rated the claims-paying ability of Connie Lee "AAA".      

Connie Lee makes no representation regarding the Bonds or the                   
advisability of investing in the Bonds. The above rating is not a               
recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Connie Lee insured Bonds and            
such rating is subject to the revision or withdrawal at any time by the         
rating agency. Any downward revision or withdrawal of the rating may            
have an adverse effect on the market price of the Connie Lee insured            
Bonds.                                                                          

The address of Connie Lee's administrative offices and its telephone            
number are 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20004 and           
(800) 221-1854.                                                                 

Because the Bonds in each Insured Trust are insured as to the scheduled         
payment of principal and interest and on the basis of the financial             
condition of the insurance companies referred to above, Standard &              
Poor's has assigned to units of each Insured Trust its "AAA" investment         
rating. This is the highest rating assigned to securities by Standard &         
Poor's. See "Description of Bond Ratings." The obtaining of this rating         
by each Insured Trust should not be construed as an approval of the             
offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's or as a guarantee of the             
market value of each Insured Trust or the Units of such Trust. Standard         
& Poor's has indicated that this rating is not a recommendation to buy,         
hold or sell Units nor does it take into account the extent to which            
expenses of each Trust or sales by each Trust of Bonds for less than the        
purchase price paid by such Trust will reduce payment to Unit holders of        
the interest and principal required to be paid on such Bonds. Such              
rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the               
Initial Date of Deposit of an Insured Trust and will, unless renewed,           
terminate at the end of such period. There is no guarantee that the             
"AAA" investment rating with respect to the Units of an Insured Trust           
will be maintained.                                                             

An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by such Insured Trust is to        
obtain a higher yield on the Bonds in the portfolio of such Trust than          
would be available if all the Bonds in such portfolio had the Standard &        
Poor's "AAA" and/or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. "Aaa" rating(s) and         
at the same time to have the protection of insurance of scheduled               
payment of interest and principal on the Bonds. There is, of course, no         
certainty that this result will be achieved. Bonds in a Trust for which         
insurance has been obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the           
Sponsor or others (all of which were rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's           
and/or "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.) may or may not have a          
higher yield than uninsured bonds rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's or           
"Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. In selecting Bonds for the             
portfolio of each Insured Trust, the Sponsor has applied the criteria           
herein before described.

What are the Expenses and Charges?                                              

With the exception of bookkeeping and other administrative services             
provided to the Trusts, for which the Sponsor will be reimbursed in             
amounts as set forth under "Special Trust Information" in each Part One         
of this Prospectus, the Sponsor will not receive any fee in connection          
with its activities relating to the Trusts. For Series 49 and all               
subsequent Series, First Trust Advisors L.P., an affiliate of the               
Sponsor, will receive an annual supervisory fee, which is not to exceed         
the amount set forth in Part One for each Trust, for providing portfolio        
supervisory services for the Trust. Such fee is based on the number of          
Units outstanding in each Trust on January 1 of each year except for            
Trusts which were established subsequent to the last January 1, in which        
case the fee will be based on the number of Units outstanding in such           
Trusts as of the respective Initial Dates of Deposit.                           

For each valuation of the Bonds in a Trust, the Evaluator will receive a        
fee as indicated in Part One of this Prospectus. The Trustee pays               
certain expenses of each Trust for which it is reimbursed by such Trust.        

The Trustee will receive for its ordinary recurring services to a Trust         
an annual fee computed as indicated in Part One of this Prospectus. For         
a discussion of the services performed by the Trustee pursuant to its           
obligations under the Indenture, reference is made to the material set          
forth under "Rights of Unit Holders."                                           

The Trustee's and Evaluator's fees are payable monthly on or before each        
Distribution Date from the Interest Account of each Trust to the extent         
funds are available and then from the Principal Account of such Trust.          
Since the Trustee has the use of the funds being held in the Principal          
and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses and         
redemptions and since such Accounts are non-interest-bearing to Unit            
holders, the Trustee benefits thereby. Part of the Trustee's                    
compensation for its services to the Fund is expected to result from the        
use of these funds. However, the Trustee may bear from its own resources        
certain expenses relating to a Trust.                                           

Each of the above mentioned fees may be increased without approval of           
the Unit holders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under         
the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price          
Index published by the United States Department of Labor. In addition,          
with respect to the fees payable to the Sponsor or an affiliate of the          
Sponsor for providing bookkeeping and other administrative services and         
supervisory services, such individual fees may exceed the actual costs          
of providing such services for a Trust, but at no time will the total           
amount received for such Services rendered to all unit investment trusts        
of which Nike Securities L.P. is the Sponsor in any calendar year exceed        
the actual cost to the Sponsor or its affiliate of supplying such               
services in such year.                                                          

The annualized cost of the portfolio insurance obtained by the Fund for         
each Insured Trust is indicated in Part One for each Trust in a Series          
of the Fund. The portfolio insurance continues so long as such Trust            
retains the Bonds thus insured. Premiums are payable monthly in advance         
by the Trustee on behalf of such Trust. As Bonds in the portfolio are           
redeemed by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the            
amount of premium will be reduced in respect of those Bonds no longer           
owned by and held in the Trust which were insured by insurance obtained         
by such Trust. Preinsured Bonds for which insurance has been obtained           
from Financial Guaranty and/or Ambac Assurance or, beginning with Series        
25 and all subsequent Series, other insurers, are not insured by such           
Trust. The premium payable for Permanent Insurance will be paid solely          
from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond in the event the Trustee             
exercises the right to obtain Permanent Insurance on a Bond. The                
premiums for such Permanent Insurance with respect to each Bond will            
decline over the life of the Bond. An Advantage Trust is not insured;           
accordingly, there are no premiums for insurance payable by such Trust.         

The following additional charges are or may be incurred by a Trust: all         
expenses (including legal and annual auditing expenses) of the Trustee          
incurred in connection with its responsibilities under the Indenture,           
except in the event of negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on           
its part; the expenses and costs of any action undertaken by the Trustee        
to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of the Unit holders;          

Page 16                                                                         

fees of the Trustee for any extraordinary services performed under the          
Indenture; indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or            
expense incurred by it without negligence, bad faith or willful                 
misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with its                
acceptance or administration of the Trust; indemnification of the               
Sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross               
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as Depositor of           
the Trust; all taxes and other government charges imposed upon the Bonds        
or any part of the Trust (no such taxes or charges are being levied or          
made or, to the knowledge of the Sponsor, are contemplated); and                
expenditures incurred in contacting Unit holders upon termination of the        
Trust. The above expenses and the Trustee's annual fee, when paid or            
owing to the Trustee, are secured by a lien on the Trust. In addition,          
the Trustee is empowered to sell Bonds of a Trust in order to make funds        
available to pay all these amounts if funds are not otherwise available         
in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the Trust.                            

Unless the Sponsor determines that such an audit is not required, the           
Indenture requires the accounts of each Trust to be audited on an annual        
basis at the expense of the Trust by independent auditors selected by           
the Sponsor. So long as the Sponsor is making a secondary market for            
Units, the Sponsor shall bear the cost of such annual audits to the             
extent such cost exceeds $.50 per Unit. Unit holders of a Trust covered         
by an audit may obtain a copy of the audited financial statements from          
the Trustee upon request.                                                       

PUBLIC OFFERING       

How is the Public Offering Price Determined?                                    

Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to maintain a        
market for the Units and continuously to offer to purchase Units at             
prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid             
price of the Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust plus the amount of            
Purchased Interest of a Trust (if any) and interest accrued to the date         
of settlement. All expenses incurred in maintaining a market, other than        
the fees of the Evaluator and the costs of the Trustee in transferring          
and recording the ownership of Units, will be borne by the Sponsor. If          
the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for some other business reason,          
the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. IF A UNIT        
HOLDER WISHES TO DISPOSE OF HIS UNITS, HE SHOULD INQUIRE OF THE SPONSOR         
AS TO CURRENT MARKET PRICES PRIOR TO MAKING A TENDER FOR REDEMPTION TO          
THE TRUSTEE. Prospectuses relating to certain other bond funds indicate         
an intention, subject to change, on the part of the respective sponsors         
of such funds to repurchase units of those funds on the basis of a price        
higher than the bid prices of the securities in the funds. Consequently,        
depending upon the prices actually paid, the repurchase price of other          
sponsors for units of their funds may be computed on a somewhat more            
favorable basis than the repurchase price offered by the Sponsor for            
Units of a Trust in secondary market transactions. As in the First Trust        
Combined Series, the purchase price per unit of such bond funds will            
depend primarily on the value of the securities in the Portfolio of the         
applicable Trust.                                                               

The Public Offering Price of Units of a Trust will be determined by             
adding to the Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of           
the Bonds in a Trust plus the amount of Purchased Interest of a Trust           
(if any) and the appropriate sales charge determined in accordance with         
the schedule set forth below, based upon the number of years remaining          
to the maturity of each Bond in the portfolio of the Trust, adjusting           
the total to reflect the amount of any cash held in or advanced to the          
principal account of the Trust and dividing the result by the number of         
Units of such trust then outstanding. The minimum sales charge on Units         
will be 3% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to 3.093% of the net        
amount invested). For purposes of computation, Bonds will be deemed to          
mature on their expressed maturity dates unless: (a) the Bonds have been        
called for redemption or funds or securities have been placed in escrow         
to redeem them on an earlier call date, in which case such call date            
will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature; or (b) such Bonds         
are subject to a "mandatory tender," in which case such mandatory tender        
will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature. The offering price        
of Bonds in the Trust may be expected to be greater than the bid price          
of such Bonds by approximately 1-2% of the aggregate principal amount of        
such Bonds.                                                                     

The effect of this method of sales charge computation will be that              
different sales charge rates will be applied to each of the various             
Bonds in the Trusts based upon the maturities of such bonds, in                 
accordance with the following schedule:

There will be no reduction of the sales charges for volume purchases. A         
dealer will receive from the Sponsor a dealer concession of 70% of the          
total sales charges for Units sold by such dealer and dealers will not          
be eligible for additional concessions for Units sold pursuant to the           
above schedule.                                                                 

An investor may aggregate purchases of Units of two or more consecutive         
series of a particular State, National, Discount, Intermediate, Long            
Intermediate or Short Intermediate Trust for purposes of calculating the        
discount for volume purchases listed above. Additionally, with respect          
to the employees, officers and directors (including their immediate             
family members, defined as spouses, children, grandchildren, parents,           
grandparents, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, sons-in-law and daughters-        
in-law, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such         
person) of the Sponsor and broker/dealers and their subsidiaries and            
vendors providing services to the Sponsor, may purchase Units of the            
Trusts during the secondary market at the Public Offering Price less the        
concession the Sponsor typically allows broker/dealers.                         

Any such reduced sales charge shall be the responsibility of the selling        
broker/dealer. The reduced sales charge structure will apply on all             
purchases of Units in a Trust by the same person on any one day from the        
Sponsor or any one broker/dealer and, for purposes of calculating the           
applicable sales charge, purchases of Units in the Fund will be                 
aggregated with concurrent purchases by the same person from the Sponsor        
or such broker/dealer of Units in any series of tax-exempt unit                 
investment trusts sponsored by Nike Securities L.P. Additionally, Units         
purchased in the name of the spouse of a purchaser or in the name of a          
child of such purchaser will be deemed, for the purpose of calculating          
the applicable sales charge, to be additional purchases by the                  
purchaser. The reduced sales charges will also be applicable to a               
trustee or other fiduciary purchasing securities for a single trust             
estate or single fiduciary account.                                             

From time to time the Sponsor may implement programs under which                
broker/dealers and other selling agents of the Fund may receive nominal         
awards from the Sponsor for each of their registered representatives who        
have sold a minimum number of UIT Units during a specified time period.         
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs          
under which the sales force of broker/dealers and other selling agents          
may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts,          
or under which the Sponsor will reallow to any such broker/dealer or            
other selling agent that sponsors sales contests or recognition programs        
conforming to criteria established by the Sponsor, or participates in           
sales programs sponsored by the Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the            
total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such person at         
the public offering price during such programs. Also, the Sponsor in its        
discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria                 
established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying broker/dealers and            
other selling agents for certain services or activities which are               
primarily intended to result in sales of Units of the Trusts. Such              
payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and not out of          
the assets of the Trusts. These programs will not change the price Unit         
holders pay for their Units or the amount that the Trusts will receive          
from the Units sold.                                                            

A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current               
returns and estimated long-term returns with the returns on various             
taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment          
decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales        
materials compare the then current estimated returns on the Trust and           
returns over specified periods on other similar Trusts sponsored by Nike        

Page 18                                                                         

Securities L.P. with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or        
U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and money market accounts or money              
market funds, each of which has investment characteristics that may             
differ from those of the Trust. U.S. Government bonds, for example, are         
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government and bank CDs         
and money market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal               
government. Money market accounts and money market funds provide                
stability of principal, but pay interest at rates that vary with the            
condition of the short-term debt market. The investment characteristics         
of the Trust are described more fully elsewhere in this Prospectus.             

The aggregate price of the Bonds in each Trust is determined by the             
evaluator (the "Evaluator"), on the basis of bid prices (1) on the basis        
of current market prices for the Bonds obtained from dealers or brokers         
who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the Trust; (2)        
if such prices are not available for any of the Bonds, on the basis of          
current market prices for comparable bonds; (3) by determining the value        
of the Bonds by appraisal; or (4) by any combination of the above.              
Unless Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or, in          
the Sponsor's opinion, in significant risk of such default, the                 
Evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an          
Insured Trust. On the other hand, the value of insurance obtained by the        
issuer of Bonds in a Trust is reflected and included in the market value        
of such Bonds.                                                                  

The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of Bonds which are in             
default in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's                
opinion, in significant risk of such default (the "Defaulted Bonds") and        
which are covered by insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, the value          
of the insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments. The value        
of the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market         
value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain           
Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premium attributable to the             
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such              
Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In addition, the            
Evaluator will consider the ability of Financial Guaranty and/or Ambac          
Assurance to meet its commitments under an Insured Trust's insurance            
policy, including the commitments to issue Permanent Insurance. It is           
the position of the Sponsor that this is a fair method of valuing the           
Bonds and the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust and reflects a             
proper valuation method in accordance with the provisions of the                
Investment Company Act of 1940.                                                 

The Evaluator will be requested to make a determination of the aggregate        
price of the Bonds in each Trust, on a bid price basis, as of the close         
of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day on which it is            
open, effective for all sales, purchases or redemptions made subsequent         
to the last preceding determination.                                            

Although payment is normally made three business days following the             
order for purchase, payment may be made prior thereto. A person will            
become owner of the Units on the date of settlement provided payment has        
been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to the         
date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the                 
Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor,            
subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.              
Delivery of Certificates representing Units so ordered will be made             
three business days following such order or shortly thereafter. See             
"Rights of Unit Holders-How May Units Be Redeemed?" for information             
regarding the ability to redeem Units ordered for purchase.                     

How are Units Distributed?                                                      

Units repurchased in the secondary market (see "Public Offering-Will            
There be a Secondary Market?") may be offered by this Prospectus at the         
secondary market public offering price determined in the manner                 
described above.                                                                

It is the intention of the Sponsor to qualify Units of the Fund for sale        
in a number of states. Sales will be made to dealers and others at              
prices which represent a concession or agency commission of 4.0% of the         
Public Offering Price per Unit for each State, Discount or National             
Trust, 3.0% of the Public Offering Price for an Intermediate or Long            
Intermediate Trust, and 2.5% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for a        
Short Intermediate Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, broker/dealers         
or other selling agents who purchase, in the aggregate, $250,000 of the         
Trusts on any day will receive a volume concession or agency commission         
of $40.00 per Unit. However, resales of Units of a Trust by such                
broker/dealers and other selling agents to the public will be made at           
the Public Offering Price described in this Prospectus. The Sponsor             

Page 19                                                                         

reserves the right to change the amount of the concession or agency             
commission from time to time. Certain commercial banks are making Units         
of the Fund available to their customers on an agency basis. A portion          
of the sales charge paid by these customers is retained by or remitted          
to the banks in the amounts indicated in the amounts indicated above.           
Under the Glass-Steagall Act, banks are prohibited from underwriting            
Units; however, the Glass-Steagall Act does permit certain agency               
transactions and the banking regulators have not indicated that these           
particular agency transactions are not permitted under such Act. In             
Texas and in certain other states, any banks making Units available must        
be registered as broker/dealers under state law.                                

What are the Sponsor's Profits?                                                 

The Sponsor and participating dealers will receive a maximum gross sales        
commission equal to 5.8% of the Public Offering Price of the Units of           
each State Trust (equivalent to 6.157% of the net amount invested), 5.8%        
of the Public Offering Price of the Units of a National or Discount             
Trust (equivalent to 6.157% of the net amount invested), 4.7% of the            
Public Offering Price of the Units of an Intermediate or Long                   
Intermediate Trust (equivalent to 4.932% of the net amount invested),           
and 3.7% of the Public Offering Price of the Units of a Short                   
Intermediate Trust (equivalent to 3.842% of the net amount invested)            
less any reduced sales charge for quantity purchases as described under         
"Public Offering-How is the Public Offering Price Determined?"                  

In maintaining a market for the Units, the Sponsor will also realize            
profits or sustain losses in the amount of any difference between the           
price at which Units are purchased (based on the bid prices of the Bonds        
in each Trust) and the price at which Units are resold (which price is          
also based on the bid prices of the Bonds in each Trust and includes a          
maximum sales charge of 5.8% for a State Trust, 5.8% for a National or          
Discount Trust, 4.7% for an Intermediate or Long Intermediate Trust and         
3.7% for a Short Intermediate Trust) or redeemed. The secondary market          
public offering price of Units may be greater or less than the cost of          
such Units to the Sponsor.                                                      

RIGHTS OF UNIT HOLDERS 

How are Certificates Issued and Transferred?                                    

The Trustee is authorized to treat as the record owner of Units that            
person who is registered as such owner on the books of the Trustee.             
Ownership of Units is evidenced by registered certificates executed by          
the Trustee and the Sponsor. Delivery of certificates representing Units        
ordered for purchase is normally made three business days following such        
order or shortly thereafter. Certificates are transferable by                   
presentation and surrender to the Trustee properly endorsed or                  
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer.                 
Certificates to be redeemed must be properly endorsed or accompanied by         
a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unit holder must sign        
exactly as his name appears on the face of the certificate with the             
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents         
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in         
addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the           
Trustee. In certain instances the Trustee may require additional                
documents such as, but not limited to, trust instruments, certificates          
of death, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates of          
corporate authority. Record ownership may occur before settlement.              

Certificates will be issued in fully registered form, transferable only         
on the books of the Trustee in denominations of one Unit or any multiple        
thereof, numbered serially for purposes of identification. Certificates         
for Units will bear an appropriate notation on their face indicating            
which plan of distribution has been selected in respect thereof. When a         
change is made, the existing certificate must be surrendered to the             
Trustee and a new certificate issued to reflect the then currently              
effective plan of distribution. There is no charge for this service.            

Although no such charge is now made or contemplated, a Unit holder may          
be required to pay $2.00 to the Trustee per certificate reissued or             
transferred for reasons other than to change the plan of distribution,          
and to pay any governmental charge that may be imposed in connection            
with each such transfer or exchange. For new certificates issued to             
replace destroyed, stolen or lost certificates, the Unit holder may be          
required to furnish indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee and pay such          
expenses as the Trustee may incur. Mutilated certificates must be               
surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.                                     

Page 20                                                                         

How are Interest and Principal Distributed?                                     

Record Dates for the distribution of interest under the semi-annual             
distribution plan are the fifteenth day of June and December with the           
Distribution Dates being the last day of the month in which the related         
Record Date occurs. It is anticipated that an amount equal to                   
approximately one-half of the amount of net annual interest income per          
Unit will be distributed on or shortly after each Distribution Date to          
Unit holders of record on the preceding Record Date. Record Dates for           
monthly distributions of interest are the fifteenth day of each month.          
The Distribution Dates for distributions of interest under the monthly          
plan is the last day of each month in which the related Record Date             
occurs. See "Special Trust Information" appearing in each Part I of this        
Prospectus.                                                                     

The plan of distribution selected by a Unit holder will remain in effect        
until changed. Unit holders purchasing Units in the secondary market            
will initially receive distributions in accordance with the election of         
the prior owner. Each year, approximately six weeks prior to the end of         
May, the Trustee will furnish each Unit holder a card to be returned to         
the Trustee not more than thirty nor less than ten days before the end          
of such month. Unit holders desiring to change the plan of distribution         
in which they are participating may so indicate on the card and return          
same, together with their certificate, to the Trustee. If the card and          
certificate are returned to the Trustee, the change will become                 
effective as of June 16 of that year. If the card and certificate are           
not returned to the Trustee, the Unit holder will be deemed to have             
elected to continue with the same plan for the following twelve months.         

The pro rata share of cash in the Principal Account of each Trust will          
be computed as of the fifteenth day of each month, and distributions to         
the Unit holders of such Trust as of such Record Date will be made on           
the dates specified in Part One. Proceeds from the disposition of any of        
the Bonds of such Trust (less any premiums due with respect to Bonds for        
which the Trustee has exercised the right to obtain Permanent Insurance)        
received after such Record Date and prior to the following Distribution         
Date will be held in the Principal Account of such Trust and not                
distributed until the next Distribution Date. The Trustee is not                
required to make a distribution from the Principal Account of a Trust           
unless the amount available for distribution shall equal at least $1.00         
per Unit.                                                                       

The Trustee will credit to the Interest Account of each Trust all               
interest received by such Trust, including that part of the proceeds            
(including insurance proceeds if any, paid to an Insured Trust) of any          
disposition of Bonds which represents accrued interest. Other receipts          
will be credited to the Principal Account of such Trust. The                    
distribution to the Unit holders of a Trust as of each Record Date will         
be made on the following Distribution Date or shortly thereafter and            
shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of the           
holder's pro rata share of the estimated annual income of such Trust            
after deducting estimated expenses. Except through an advancement of its        
own Funds, the Trustee has no cash for distribution to Unit holders             
until it receives interest payments on the Bonds in a Trust. The Trustee        
shall be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from funds         
in the Interest Account of such Trust on the ensuing Record Date.               
Persons who purchase Units between a Record Date and a Distribution Date        
will receive their first distribution on the second Distribution Date           
after the purchase, under the applicable plan of distribution. The              
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal          
or Interest Account of a Trust (but may itself earn interest thereon and        
therefore benefit from the use of such funds).                                  

As of the fifteenth day of each month, the Trustee will deduct from the         
Interest Account of each Trust and, to the extent funds are not                 
sufficient therein, from the Principal Account of each Trust, amounts           
necessary to pay the expenses of such Trust. The Trustee also may               
withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary         
to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the          
Trust. Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of the               
Trust's assets until such time as the Trustee shall return all or any           
part of such amounts to the appropriate account. In addition, the               
Trustee may withdraw from the Interest Account and the Principal Account        
of a Trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemption of Units        
of such Trust by the Trustee.                                                   

How Can Distributions to Unit Holders be Reinvested?                            

Universal Distribution Option. Unit holders may elect participation in a        
Universal Distribution Option which permits a Unit holder to direct the         
Trustee to distribute principal and interest payments to any other              
investment vehicle of which the Unit holder has an existing account. For        
example, at a Unit holder's direction, the Trustee would distribute             

Page 21                                                                         

automatically on the applicable distribution date interest income or            
principal on the participant's Units to, among other investment                 
vehicles, a Unit holder's checking, bank savings, money market,                 
insurance, reinvestment or any other account. All such distributions, of        
course, are subject to the minimum investment and sales charges, if any,        
of the particular investment vehicle to which distributions are                 
directed. The Trustee will notify the participant of each distribution          
pursuant to the Universal Distribution Option. The Trustee will                 
distribute directly to the Unit holder any distributions which are not          
accepted by the specified investment vehicle. A participant may at any          
time, by so notifying the Trustee in writing, elect to terminate his            
participation in the Universal Distribution Option and receive directly         
future distributions on his Units.                                              

Distribution Reinvestment Option. The Sponsor has entered into an               
arrangement with Oppenheimer Management Corporation, which permits any          
Unit holder of a Trust to elect to have each distribution of interest           
income or principal on his Units automatically reinvested in shares of          
either the Oppenheimer Intermediate Tax-Exempt Bond Fund (the                   
"Intermediate Series") or the Oppenheimer Insured Tax-Exempt Bond Fund          
(the "Insured Series"). Oppenheimer Management Corporation is the               
investment adviser of each Series which are open-end, diversified               
management investment companies. The investment objective of the                
Intermediate Series is to provide a high level of current interest              
income exempt from Federal income tax through the purchase of investment        
grade securities. The investment objective of the Insured Series is to          
provide as high a level of current interest income exempt from Federal          
income tax as is consistent with the assurance of the scheduled receipt         
of interest and principal through insurance and the preservation of             
capital (the income of either Series may constitute an item of                  
preference for determining the Federal alternative minimum tax). The            
objectives and policies of each Series are presented in more detail in          
the prospectus for each Series.                                                 

Each person who purchases Units of a Trust may contact the Trustee to           
request a prospectus describing each Series and a form by which such            
person may elect to become a participant in a Distribution Reinvestment         
Option with respect to a Series. Each distribution of interest income or        
principal on the participant's Units will automatically be applied by           
the Trustee to purchase shares (or fractions thereof) of a Series               
without a sales charge and with no minimum investment requirements.             

The shareholder service agent for each Series will mail to each                 
participant in the Distribution Reinvestment Option confirmations of all        
transactions undertaken for such participant in connection with the             
receipt of distributions from The First Trust Combined Series and the           
purchase of shares (or fractions thereof) of a Series.                          

A participant may at any time, by so notifying the Trustee in writing,          
elect to terminate his participation in the Distribution Reinvestment           
Option and receive future distributions on his Units in cash. There will        
be no charge or other penalty for such termination. The Sponsor and             
Oppenheimer Management Corporation each have the right to terminate the         
Distribution Reinvestment Option, in whole or in part.                          

It should be remembered that even if distributions are reinvested               
through the Universal Distribution Option or the Distribution                   
Reinvestment Option they are still treated as distributions for income          
tax purposes.                                                                   

What Reports Will Unit Holders Receive?                                         

The Trustee shall furnish Unit holders of each Trust in connection with         
each distribution a statement of the amount of interest, if any, and the        
amount of other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed        
in each case as a dollar amount per Unit. Within a reasonable time after        
the last business day of each calendar year, the Trustee will furnish to        
each person who at any time during the calendar year was a Unit holder          
of a Trust of record, a statement as to (1) the Interest Account:               
interest received by such Trust (including amounts representing interest        
received upon any disposition of Bonds of such Trust), the amount of            
such interest representing insurance proceeds (if applicable),                  

Page 22                                                                         

deductions for payment of applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of         
the Trust, redemption of Units and the balance remaining after such             
distributions and deductions, expressed both as a total dollar amount           
and as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit             
outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year; (2) the             
Principal Account: the dates of disposition of any Bonds of such Trust          
and the net proceeds received therefrom (excluding any portion                  
representing interest and the premium attributable to the exercise of           
the right, if applicable, to obtain Permanent Insurance), deduction for         
payment of applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of the Trust,             
redemptions of Units, and the balance remaining after such distributions        
and deductions, expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar         
amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding on the          
last business day of such calendar year; (3) the Bonds held and the             
number of Units of such Trust outstanding on the last business day of           
such calendar year; (4) the Redemption Price per Unit based upon the            
last computation thereof made during such calendar year; and (5) the            
amounts actually distributed during such calendar year from the Interest        
Account and from the Principal Account of such Trust, separately stated,        
expressed both as total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per Unit           
outstanding on the Record Date for such distributions.                          

In order to comply with Federal and state tax reporting requirements,           
Unit holders will be furnished, upon request to the Trustee, evaluations        
of the Bonds in their Trust furnished to it by the Evaluator.                   

Each distribution statement will reflect pertinent information in               
respect of each plan of distribution so that Unit holders may be                
informed regarding the results of the other plan or plans of distribution.      

How May Units be Redeemed?                                                      

A Unit holder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by tender to the         
Trustee at its unit investment trust office in the City of New York of          
the certificates representing the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or        
accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with signature guaranteed         
as explained above (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, as in               
connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates), and payment of         
applicable governmental charges, if any. No redemption fee will be              
charged. On the third day following such tender, the Unit holder will be        
entitled to receive in cash an amount for each Unit equal to the                
Redemption Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of         
such tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on          
which Units are received by the Trustee (if such day is a day on which          
the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading), except that as regards        
Units received after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange        
(generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a        
day on which the New York Stock Exchange is scheduled in advance to             
close at such earlier time), the date of tender is the next day on which        
such Exchange is open for trading and such Units will be deemed to have         
been tendered to the Trustee on such day for redemption at the                  
redemption price computed on that day. Units so redeemed shall be               
cancelled.                                                                      

Purchased Interest (if any) and other accrued interest to the settlement        
date paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account of         
a Trust or, if the balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal          
Account of such Trust. All other amounts paid on redemption shall be            
withdrawn from the Principal Account of the Trust.                              

The Redemption Price per Unit will be determined on the basis of the bid        
price of the Bonds in a Trust and the amount of Purchased Interest of           
the Trust (if any), as of the close of trading on the New York Stock            
Exchange on the date any such determination is made. The Redemption             
Price per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit determined by the             
Trustee on the basis of (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or moneys in          
the process of being collected, (2) the value of the Bonds in such Trust        
based on the bid prices of the Bonds, except for those cases in which           
the value of the insurance, if applicable, has been added, and (3)              
Purchased Interest (if any) and any other interest accrued thereon, less        
(a) amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out        
of such Trust, (b) the accrued expenses of such Trust, and (c) cash held        
for distribution to Unit holders of record as of a date prior to the            
evaluation then being made. The Evaluator may determine the value of the        
Bonds in a Trust (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the Bonds            
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds                  
comparable to those held by such Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices          
for bonds comparable to any Bonds for which bid prices are not                  
available, (3) by determining the value of the Bonds by appraisal, or           
(4) by any combination of the above. In determining the Redemption Price        
per Unit for an Insured Trust, no value will be attributed to the               
portfolio insurance covering the Bonds in such Trust unless such Bonds          
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant            
risk of such default. On the other hand, Bonds insured under a policy           
obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others are        
entitled to the benefits of such insurance at all times and such                
benefits are reflected and included in the market value of such Bonds.          
See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?" For a description of          

Page 23                                                                         

the situations in which the evaluator may value the insurance obtained          
by an Insured Trust, see "Public Offering-How is the Public Offering
Price Determined?"                                                              

The difference between the bid and offering prices of such Bonds may be         
expected to average 1-2% of the principal amount. In the case of                
actively traded bonds, the difference may be as little as 1/2 of 1% and,        
in the case of inactively traded bonds, such difference usually will not        
exceed 3%. Therefore, the price at which Units may be redeemed could be         
less than the price paid by the Unit holder and may be less than the par        
value of the Securities represented by the Units so redeemed.                   

The Trustee is empowered to sell underlying Bonds in a Trust in order to        
make funds available for redemption. To the extent that Bonds are sold,         
the size and diversity of such Trust will be reduced. Such sales may be         
required at a time when Bonds would not otherwise be sold and might             
result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                        

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any          
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than           
for customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the                 
Securities and Exchange Commission determines that trading on that              
Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of which             
disposal or evaluation of the Bonds is not reasonably practicable, or           
for such other periods as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by         
order permit. Under certain extreme circumstances, the Sponsor may apply        
to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an order permitting a full        
or partial suspension of the right of Unit holders to redeem their Units.       

How May Units be Purchased by the Sponsor?                                      

The Trustee shall notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for                 
redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the secondary market at that time           
equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit, which for certain              
Trusts includes Purchased Interest, it may purchase such Units by               
notifying the Trustee before 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on the next                 
succeeding business day and by making payment therefor to the Unit              
holder not later than the day on which the Units would otherwise have           
been redeemed by the Trustee. Units held by the Sponsor may be tendered         
to the Trustee for redemption as any other Units. Any profit or loss            
resulting from the resale or redemption of such Units will belong to the        
Sponsor.                                                                        

How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?                                         

The Trustee is empowered to sell such of the Bonds in each Trust on a           
list furnished by the Sponsor as the Trustee in its sole discretion may         
deem necessary to meet redemption requests or pay expenses to the extent        
funds are unavailable. As described in the following paragraph and in           
certain other unusual circumstances for which it is determined by the           
Depositor to be in the best interests of the Unit holders or if there is        
no alternative, the Trustee is empowered to sell Bonds in a Trust which         
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant            
risk of such default and for which value has been attributed to the             
insurance, if any, obtained by the Trust. See "Rights of Unit Holders-          
How May Units be Redeemed?" The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated,        
to direct the Trustee to dispose of Bonds in a Trust in the event of            
advanced refunding. The Sponsor may from time to time act as agent for a        
Trust with respect to selling Bonds out of a Trust. From time to time,          
the Trustee may retain and pay compensation to the Sponsor subject to           
the restrictions under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.          

If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any Bond              
occurs and no provision for payment is made therefor, either pursuant to        
the portfolio insurance, if any, or otherwise, within thirty days, the          
Trustee is required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails         
to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold such Bond within thirty days         
after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the           
Trustee may, in its discretion, sell the defaulted Bond and not be              
liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.                           

The Sponsor shall instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by an           
issuer of any of the Bonds to issue new obligations in exchange and             
substitution for any Bonds pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan,         
except that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept such an offer        
or to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem        
proper if the issuer is in default with respect to such Bonds or in the         
written opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default in              
respect to such Bonds in the foreseeable future. Any obligations so             
received in exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject        
to the terms and conditions in the Indenture to the same extent as Bonds        

Page 24                                                                         

originally deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of          
obligations in exchange or substitution for underlying Bonds, the               
Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each Unit holder of the           
affected Trust, identifying the Bonds eliminated and the Bonds                  
substituted therefor. Except as stated in this paragraph and under "What
is the First Trust Combined Series?" for Failed Bonds, the acquisition          
by a Trust of any securities other than the Bonds initially deposited is        
prohibited.

included herein only for the purpose of informing investors as to the

Who is the Trustee?                                                             

The Trustee is The Chase Manhattan Bank, with its principal executive           
office located at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017 and its unit        
investment trust office at 4 New York Plaza, 6th floor, New York, New

Governors of the Federal Reserve System.                                        

Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may         
be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or                
consolidation to which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the                 
successor Trustee. The Trustee must be a banking corporation organized          
under the laws of the United States or any State and having at all times

Limitations on Liabilities of Sponsor and Trustee                               

The Sponsor and the Trustee shall be under no liability to Unit holders         
for taking any action or for refraining from taking any action in good          
faith pursuant to the Indenture, or for errors in judgment, but shall be        
liable only for their own willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross                 
negligence (ordinary negligence in the case of the Trustee) or reckless         
disregard of their obligations and duties. The Trustee shall not be             
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the           
Trustee of any of the Bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor         
to act under the Indenture, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not        
be liable for any action taken by it in good faith under the Indenture.         

The Trustee shall not be liable for any taxes or other governmental             
charges imposed upon or in respect of the Bonds or upon the interest            
thereon or upon it as Trustee under the Indenture or upon or in respect         
of the Fund which the Trustee may be required to pay under any present          
or future law of the United States of America or of any other taxing            
authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Indenture contains other        
customary provisions limiting the liability of the Trustee.                     

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the                
Indenture or become incapable of acting or become bankrupt or its               

Page 25                                                                         

affairs are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (a)          
appoint a successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the              
Trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the            
Securities and Exchange Commission, or (b) terminate the Indenture and          
liquidate the Trusts as provided herein, or (c) continue to act as              
Trustee without terminating the Indenture.                                      

Who is the Evaluator?                                                           

The Evaluator is Securities Evaluation Service, Inc., 531 East Roosevelt        
Road, Suite 200, Wheaton, Illinois 60187. The Evaluator may resign or           
may be removed by the Sponsor and the Trustee, in which event the               
Sponsor and the Trustee are to use their best efforts to appoint a              
satisfactory successor. Such resignation or removal shall become                
effective upon the acceptance of appointment by the successor Evaluator.        
If upon resignation of the Evaluator no successor has accepted                  
appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the                 
Evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the                
appointment of a successor.                                                     

The Trustee, Sponsor and Unit holders may rely on any evaluation                
furnished by the Evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the             
accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Evaluator under the Indenture           
shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information              
available to it, provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unit holders for errors in                 
judgment. This provision shall not protect the Evaluator in any case of         
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard          
of its obligations and duties.                                                  

OTHER INFORMATION       

How May the Indenture be Amended or Terminated?                                 

The Sponsor and the Trustee have the power to amend the Indenture               
without the consent of any of the Unit holders when such an amendment is        
(1) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision of          
the Indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other             
provision contained therein, or (2) to make such other provisions as            
shall not adversely affect the interest of the Unit holders (as                 
determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee), provided that         
the Indenture is not amended to increase the number of Units of any             
Trust issuable thereunder or to permit the deposit or acquisition of            
securities either in addition to or in substitution for any of the Bonds        
of any Trust initially deposited in a Trust, except for the substitution        
of certain refunding securities for Bonds or New Bonds for Failed Bonds.        
In the event of any amendment, the Trustee is obligated to notify               
promptly all Unit holders of the substance of such amendment.                   

Each Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of 100% of the Unit         
holders of such Trust or by the Trustee when the value of such Trust, as        
shown by any evaluation, is less than 20% of the aggregate principal            
amount of the Bonds initially deposited in the Trust or by the Trustee          
in the event that Units of a Trust not yet sold aggregating more than           
60% of the Units of such Trust are tendered for redemption by the               
Underwriters, including the Sponsor. If a Trust is liquidated because of        
the redemption of unsold Units of the Trust by the Underwriters, the            
Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units of such Trust the entire         
sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Indenture will terminate upon          
the redemption, sale or other disposition of the last Bond held                 
thereunder, but in no event shall it continue beyond the Mandatory              
Termination Date as indicated in Part One for each Trust. In the event          
of termination, written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to           
all Unit holders of such Trust. Within a reasonable period after                
termination, the Trustee will sell any Bonds remaining in the Trust,            
and, after paying all expenses and charges incurred by such Trust, will         
distribute to each Unit holder of such Trust (including the Sponsor if          
it then holds any Units), upon surrender for cancellation of his                
Certificate for Units, his pro rata share of the balances remaining in          
the Interest and Principal Accounts of such Trust, all as provided in           
the Indenture.

DESCRIPTION OF BOND RATINGS*        

Standard & Poor's. A brief description of the applicable Standard &             
Poor's rating symbols and their meanings follow:                                

A Standard & Poor's corporate or municipal bond rating is a current             
assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a              
specific debt obligation. This assessment may take into consideration           
obligors such as guarantors, insurers, or lessees.                              

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a             
security, inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or                 
suitability for a particular investor.                                          

The ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or         
obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers reliable.         
Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection with any              
rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial information.           
The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of               
changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or for other                
circumstances.                                                                  

The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following                     
considerations:                                                                 

l.   Likelihood of default-capacity and willingness of the obligor as to        
the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance         
with the terms of the obligation;                                               

ll.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation;                                

lll. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in        
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the         
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.                  

AAA-Bonds rated AAA have the highest rating assigned by Standard &              
Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay                 
principal is extremely strong.**                                                

AA-Bonds rated AA have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay         
principal and differ from the highest rated issues only in small degree.        

A-Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay                
principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse            
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds          
in higher rated categories.                                                     

BBB-Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay          
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate            
protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing                  
circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay             
interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds          
in higher rated categories.                                                     

Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by        
the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within           
the major rating categories.                                                    

Provisional Ratings: The letter "p" indicates that the rating is                
provisional. A provisional rating assumes the successful completion of          
the project being financed by the bonds being rated and indicates that          
payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent           
upon the successful and timely completion of the project. This rating,          
however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the        
project, makes no comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default          
upon failure of, such completion. The investor should exercise his/her          
own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk.                          

Credit Watch: Credit Watch highlights potential changes in ratings of           
bonds and other fixed income securities. It focuses on events and trends        
which place companies and government units under special surveillance by        
S&P's 180-member analytical staff. These may include mergers, voter             
referendums, actions by regulatory authorities, or developments gleaned         
from analytical reviews. Unless otherwise noted, a rating decision will         
be made within 90 days. Issues appear on Credit Watch where an event,           
situation, or deviation from trends occurred and needs to be evaluated          
as to its impact on credit ratings. A listing, however, does not mean a         
rating change is inevitable. Since S&P continuously monitors all of its         
ratings, Credit Watch is not intended to include all issues under               
review. Thus, rating changes will occur without issues appearing on             
Credit Watch.

Moody's Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable           
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings follow:       

Aaa-Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They        
carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred         
to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or by an          
exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the various          
protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be                
visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position        
of such issues. Their safety is so absolute that with the occasional            
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances, characteristically,        
their market value is affected solely by money market fluctuations.             

Aa-Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all             
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally         
known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds             
because margins of protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities          
or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or            
there may be other elements present which make the long term risks              
appear somewhat large than in Aaa securities. Their market value is             
virtually immune to all but money market influences, with the occasional        
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances.                            

A-Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes          
and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors             
giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate, but          
elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment            
sometime in the future. The market value of A-rated bonds may be                
influenced to some degree by economic performance during a sustained            
period of depressed business conditions, but, during periods of                 
normalcy, A-rated bonds frequently move in parallel with Aaa and Aa             
obligations, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few               
specific instances.                                                             

A 1 and Baa 1-Bonds which are rated A 1 and Baa 1 offer the maximum in          
security within their quality group, can be bought for possible                 
upgrading in quality, and additionally, afford the investor an                  
opportunity to gauge more precisely the relative attractiveness of              
offerings in the market place.                                                  

Baa-Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade                    
obligations; i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured.        
Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present        
but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be                        
characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such bonds         
lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative        
characteristics as well. The market value of Baa-rated bonds is more            
sensitive to changes in economic circumstances, and aside from                  
occasional speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class, Baa        
market valuations will move in parallel with Aaa, Aa, and A obligations         
during periods of economic normalcy, except in instances of oversupply.         

Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic        
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at          
the high end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range              
ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower         
end of its generic rating category.                                             

Con.(---)-Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of           
some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally.          
These are bonds secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction,         
(b) earnings of projects unseasoned in operation experience, (c) rentals        
which begin when facilities are completed, or (d) payments to which some        
other limiting condition attaches. Parenthetical rating denotes probable        
credit stature upon completion of construction or elimination of basis          
of condition.                                                                   

Fitch Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable             
Fitch Investors Service, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings follow:         

AAA-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit           
quality. The obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest        
and repay principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably             
foreseeable events.                                                             

AA-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit              
quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is           
very strong, although not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA. Bonds             
rated in the AAA and AA categories are not significantly vulnerable to          
foreseeable future developments.                                                

A-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality.           
The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered         
to be strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic         
conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.                    

BBB-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit          
quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is           

Page 29                                                                         

considered to be adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and           
circumstances, however, are more likely to have adverse impact on these         
bonds, and therefore impair timely payment. The likelihood that the             
ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than          
for bonds with higher ratings.                                                  

To provide more detailed indications of credit quality, the AA, A and           
BBB ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to          
show relative standing within these major rating categories.

Part Three                                     MAY ONLY BE USED WITH            
Dated March 31, 1999                           PART ONE AND PART TWO            

Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders                                              

At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to          
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from              
Federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective            
issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to State Trusts, where           
applicable, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as        
to the exemption of interest on such Bonds when held by residents of the        
State in which the issuers of such Bonds are located, from State income         
taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes.            
Neither the Sponsor, Chapman and Cutler, nor any of the Special Counsel         
to the Fund for State tax matters have made any special review for the          
Fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the         
bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith. If the interest        
on a Bond should be determined to be taxable, the Bond would generally          
have to be sold at a substantial discount. In addition, investors could         
be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on         
which interest is determined to be taxable.                                     

Gain realized on the sale or redemption of the Bonds by the Trustee or          
of a Unit by a Unit holder is includable in gross income for Federal            
income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax         
purposes. (Such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of        
accrued interest or accrued original issue discount, if any.) If a Bond         
is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price paid for           
the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond. When this           
accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of capital and          
reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased for a premium,        
the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the Bond. Bond           
premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond, and the tax           
basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium         
amortized in that tax year.                                                     

For purposes of the following opinions, it is assumed that each asset of        
the Trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income           
for Federal income tax purposes. At the time of the closing for each            
Trust, Chapman and Cutler, Counsel for the Sponsor, rendered an opinion         
under then existing law substantially to the effect that:                       

(1)   the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for               
Federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue             
discount on Bonds which is excludable from gross income under the               
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") will retain its status for           
Federal income tax purposes, when received by the Trusts and distributed        
to a Unit holder; however, such interest may be taken into account in           
computing the alternative minimum tax and the additional tax on branches        
of foreign corporations and the environmental tax if extended by                
Congress (the "Superfund Tax"), as noted below. See "Certain Tax Matters
Applicable to Corporate Unit Holders";                                          

ALL PARTS OF THE PROSPECTUS SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.      
THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES        
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY         
OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A         
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.                                                               

Page 1                                                                          

(2)   each Unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata              
portion of each asset of the respective Trust under subpart E,                  
subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code and will have a taxable event when        
the Trust disposes of a Bond, or when the Unit holder redeems or sells          
his or her Units. If the Unit holder disposes of a Unit, he or she is           
deemed thereby to have disposed of his or her entire pro rata interest          
in all assets of the Trust involved including his or her pro rata               
portion of all the Bonds represented by the Unit. The Taxpayer Relief           
Act of 1997 (the "1997 Act") includes provisions that treat certain             
transactions designed to reduce or eliminate risk of loss and                   
opportunities for gain (e.g. short sales, offsetting notional principal         
contracts, futures or forward contracts or similar transactions) as             
constructive sales for purposes of recognition of gain (but not loss)           
and for purposes of determining the holding period. Unit holders should         
consult their own tax advisors with regard to any such constructive sale        
rules. Unit holders must reduce the tax basis of their Units for their          
share of accrued interest received by the respective Trust, if any, on          
Bonds before the date the Trust acquired ownership of the Bonds (and the        
amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid         
to the seller) and, consequently, such Unit holders may have an increase        
in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of            
such Units. Gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of Units is                
measured by comparing the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the          
adjusted basis of the Units. If the Trustee disposes of Bonds (whether          
by sale, payment on maturity, redemption or otherwise), gain or loss is         
recognized to the Unit holder (subject to various non-recognition               
provisions of the Code). The amount of any such gain or loss is measured        
by comparing the Unit holder's pro rata share of the total proceeds from        
such disposition with the Unit holder's basis for his or her fractional         
interest in the asset disposed of. In the case of a Unit holder who             
purchases Units, such basis (before adjustment for accrued original             
issue discount and amortized bond premium, if any) is determined by             
apportioning the cost of the Units among each of the Trust assets               
ratably according to value as of the valuation date nearest the date of         
acquisition of the Units. Unit holders should consult their own tax             
advisors with regard to the calculation of basis. The tax basis                 
reduction requirements of the Code relating to amortization of bond             
premium may, under some circumstances, result in the Unit holder                
realizing a taxable gain when his or her Units are sold or redeemed for         
an amount equal to or less than his or her original cost; and                   

(3)  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by          
issuers of Bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds           
held by the Trustee will be excludable from Federal gross income if, and        
to the same extent as, such interest would have been so excludable if           
paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted Bonds provided         
that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such        
policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable           
expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer, will         
pay debt service on the Bonds.                                                  

Sections 1288 and 1272 of the Code provide a complex set of rules               
governing the accrual of original issue discount. These rules provide           
that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant          
compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the Bond, depending          
on the date the Bond was issued. In addition, special rules apply if the        
purchase price of a Bond exceeds the original issue price plus the              
amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued           
based upon its issue price (its "adjusted issue price") to prior owners.        
If a Bond is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price          
paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond.            
When this accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of            
capital and reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased           
for a premium, the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of           
the Bond. Bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond,        
and the tax basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of         
the premium amortized in that tax year. The application of these rules          
will also vary depending on the value of the Bond on the date a Unit            
holder acquires his or her Unit, and the price the Unit holder pays for         
his or her Unit. Unit holders should consult their tax advisors                 
regarding these rules and their application. See "Portfolio" appearing          
in Part One for each Trust for information relating to Bonds, if any,           
issued at an original issue discount.                                           

The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the "1993 Tax Act") subjects tax-       
exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the Code effective for             
bonds purchased after April 30, 1993. In general, market discount is the        

Page 2                                                                          

amount (if any) by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds        
an investor's purchase price (except to the extent that such difference,        
if any, is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued),            
subject to statutory de minimis rule. Market discount can arise based on        
the price a Trust pays for Bonds or the price a Unit holder pays for his        
or her Units. Under the 1993 Tax Act, accretion of market discount is           
taxable as ordinary income; under prior law the accretion had been              
treated as capital gain. Market discount that accretes while a Trust            
holds a Bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the Unit holders         
when principal payments are received on the Bond, upon sale or at               
redemption (including early redemption) or upon the sale or redemption          
of his or her Units, unless a Unit holder elects to include market              
discount in taxable income as it accrues. The market discount rules are         
complex and Unit holders should consult their tax advisors regarding            
these rules and their application.                                              

Counsel for the Sponsor has also advised that under Section 265 of the          
Code, interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or             
carry Units of a Trust is not deductible for Federal income tax                 
purposes. The Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that such         
indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying         
of Units (however, these rules generally do not apply to interest paid          
on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence).          
Also, under Section 265 of the Code, certain financial institutions that        
acquire Units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest         
expense attributable to ownership of Units. Legislative proposals have          
been made that would extend the financial institution rules to certain          
other corporations including securities dealers and other financial             
intermediaries. Investors with questions regarding these issues should          
consult with their tax advisors.                                                

In the case of certain of the Bonds in a Trust, the opinions of bond            
counsel indicate that interest on such Bonds received by a "substantial         
user" of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these Bonds,        
or persons related thereto, for periods while such Bonds are held by            
such a user or related person, will not be excludable from Federal gross        
income, although interest on such Bonds received by others would be             
excludable from Federal gross income. "Substantial user" and "related           
person" are defined under the Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations. Any           
person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related              
person as so defined should contact his or her tax advisor.                     

ALL STATEMENTS OF LAW IN THE PROSPECTUS CONCERNING EXCLUSION FROM GROSS         
INCOME FOR FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER TAX PURPOSES ARE THE OPINIONS OF             
COUNSEL AND ARE TO BE SO CONSTRUED.                                             

At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to          
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from              
Federal gross income are rendered by bond counsel to the respective             
issuing authorities. Neither the Sponsor nor Chapman and Cutler has made        
any special review for the Fund of the proceedings relating to the              
issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for such opinions.                        

In general, Section 86 of the Code provides that 50% of Social Security         
benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of           
"modified adjusted gross income" plus 50% of the Social Security                
benefits received exceeds the "base amount." The base amount is $25,000         
for unmarried taxpayers, $32,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint           
return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times        
during the taxable year and who file separate returns. Modified adjusted        
gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to              
certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income         
and by including tax-exempt interest. To the extent that Social Security        
benefits are includible in gross income, they will be treated as any            
other item of gross income.                                                     

In addition, under the 1993 Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after          
December 31 1993, up to 85% of Social Security benefits are includible          
in gross income to the extent that the sum of "modified adjusted gross          
income" plus 50% of Social Security benefits received exceeds an                
"adjusted base amount." The adjusted base amount is $34,000 for                 
unmarried taxpayers, $44,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint               
return, and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all             
times during the taxable year and who file separate returns.                    

Although tax-exempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross             
income solely for the purpose of determining what portion, if any, of           
Social Security benefits will be included in gross income, no tax-exempt        
interest, including that received from a Trust, will be subject to tax.         
A taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount          
or the adjusted base amount must include 50% or 85%, respectively, of           
his or her Social Security benefits in gross income whether or not he or        

Page 3                                                                          

she receives any tax-exempt interest. A taxpayer whose modified adjusted        
gross income (after inclusion of tax-exempt interest) does not exceed           
the base amount need not include any Social Security benefits in gross          
income.                                                                         

For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals           
and corporations and the Superfund Tax for corporations, interest on            
certain private activity bonds (which includes most industrial and              
housing revenue bonds) issued on or after August 8, 1986 is included as         
an item of tax preference. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE NOTED IN PART ONE FOR            
CERTAIN TRUSTS, THE TRUSTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY SUCH PRIVATE ACTIVITY             
BONDS ISSUED ON OR AFTER THAT DATE.                                             

The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (the          
"1998 Tax Act") provides that for taxpayers other than corporations, net        
capital gain (which is defined as net long-term capital gain over net           
short-term capital loss for the taxable year) realized from property            
(with certain exclusions) is subject to a maximum marginal stated tax           
rate of 20% (10% in the case of certain taxpayers in the lowest tax             
bracket). Capital gain or loss is long-term if the holding period for           
the asset is more than one year, and is short-term if the holding period        
for the asset is one year or less. The date on which a Unit is acquired         
(i.e., the "trade date") is excluded for purposes of determining the            
holding period of the unit. Capital gains realized from assets held for         
one year or less are taxed at the same rates as ordinary income.                

In addition, please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as           
ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are          
considered "conversion transactions" effective for transactions entered         
into after April 30, 1993. Unit holders and prospective investors should        
consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential effect of this          
provision on their investment in Units.                                         

Under the Code, taxpayers must disclose to the Internal Revenue Service         
the amount of tax-exempt interest earned during the year.                       

Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit Holders. In the case of        
certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax and the Superfund Tax         
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986 depend upon the             
corporation's alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is the         
corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the               
adjustment items used in computing AMTI of a corporation (other than an         
S Corporation, Regulated Investment Company, Real Estate Investment             
Trust, REMIC or FASIT) is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such          
corporation's "adjusted current earnings" over an amount equal to its           
AMTI (before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating         
loss deduction). "Adjusted current earnings" includes all tax-exempt            
interest, including interest on all of the Bonds in the Trusts. Under           
current Code provisions, the Superfund Tax does not apply to tax years          
beginning on or after January 1, 1996. Legislative proposals have been          
introduced that would reinstate the Superfund Tax for taxable years             
beginning after December 31, 1997 and before January 1, 2009. Under the         
provisions of Section 884 of the Code, a branch profits tax is levied on        
the "effectively connected earnings and profits" of certain foreign             
corporations which include tax-exempt interest such as interest on the          
Bonds in the Trust. Unit holders should consult their tax advisors with         
respect to the particular tax consequences to them, including the               
corporate alternative minimum tax, the Superfund Tax and the branch             
profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the Code.                                 

Ownership of the Units may result in collateral federal income tax              
consequences to certain taxpayers, including, without limitation,               
corporations, subject to the branch profits tax, financial institutions,        
certain insurance companies, certain S corporations, individual                 
recipients of Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and               
taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred (or continued) indebtedness        
to purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations. Prospective investors              
should consult their tax advisors as to the applicability of any such           
collateral consequences.                                                        

At the time of the closing, Winston & Strawn (previously named Cole &           
Deitz), Special Counsel to Series 4-125 of the Fund for New York tax            
matters, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax laws of the         
State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that each Trust         
in Series 4-125 of the Fund is not an association taxable as a                  
corporation and the income of each Trust in Series 4-125 of the Fund            
will be treated as the income of the Unit holder in the same manner as          
for Federal income tax purposes (subject to differences in accounting           
for discount and premium to the extent the State and/or City of New York        
do not conform to current Federal law).                                         

At the time of the closing, Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, Special Counsel          
to the Fund for New York tax matters for Series 126 and subsequent              
Series of the Fund, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax          

Page 4                                                                          

laws of the State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that        
each Trust will not constitute an association taxable as a corporation          
under New York law, and accordingly will not be subject to the New York         
State franchise tax or the New York City general corporation tax. Under         
the income tax laws of the State and City of New York, the income of            
each Trust will be considered the income of the holders of the Units.           

All statements in the Prospectus concerning exclusion from gross income         
for Federal, state or other are the opinions of Counsel and are to be so        
construed.                                                                      

Certain Considerations                                                          

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of           
the general factors which may impact certain issuers of Bonds and does          
not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse           
conditions to which the issuers of Bonds held by the National Trusts are        
subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social         
and environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the             
control of the issuers of the Bonds, could affect or could have an              
adverse impact on the financial condition of the issuers. The Sponsor is        
unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other               
factors may affect the issuers of the Bonds, the market value or                
marketability of the Bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of          
the Bonds acquired by the National Trusts to pay interest on or                 
principal of the Bonds.
