Post-war Life at Willesden

 The Beginnings in London
Joseph Baker & Sons became established in England with the move of 
        Joseph Baker and his family from Canada in 1878 to join his eldest son 
        in London, New inventions were added to the product line and soon, George, 
        Joseph’s third son, who had inherited his father’s engineering 
        genius, began to add his own ideas. Successful experiments were made with 
        powered large-scale sifting and mixing machinery and they found that England 
        offered an almost unlimited field for such equipment. J. Allen Baker visited 
        many bake houses and was horrified by what he witnessed: "Night baking 
        with intolerably long hours, the workers sleeping in their kneading-troughs, 
        the kneading done with bare feet, no proper ventilation or sanitary arrangements, 
        cockroaches, mice and sometimes even rats in untold numbers".
He saw these things as being as dangerous to the public as they were 
        to the workers and resolved to improve conditions by introducing machinery 
        into the confectionery and baking industry. He found the owners and employers 
        very willing to adopt improvements but, quite soon, the difficulty began 
        to be in production.
In 1879, a small factory with less than a dozen men was opened in Tabernacle 
        Walk, Finsbury. The business continued to prosper and, in 1881, they were 
        compelled to take on more people and move to larger premises at 58 City 
        Road. The works’ main entrance was in Bell Yard, off Featherstone 
        Street. Further growth necessitated the development of additional premises 
        on the opposite side of City Road, in Craven Street. (See also Before 
        Westwood). 
The Start of a Global Marketing Strategy
Their first really large expansion, however, took place after the London 
        International Exhibition of Flour Mill Machinery at the Agricultural Hall, 
        Islington in 1881. Here they had a considerable exhibit of flour sifters 
        and mixers and of biscuit-making equipment of various kinds. This exhibition 
        marked the beginning of mechanical baking in the United Kingdom and from 
        this time the business of Joseph Baker & Sons expanded more and more 
        rapidly.
The Health Exhibition in South Kensington followed where they had four 
        model bakeries in actual operation, incorporating more than a hundred 
        of their machines. Large exhibits were sent to other exhibitions of a 
        similar kind wherever in the world they were held – Edinburgh and 
        Amsterdam in 1886, Adelaide, South Australia in 1887 and Barcelona in 
        1888. 1889 saw the most remarkable exhibition of its kind in Paris where 
        they had their own Boulangerie Anglaise, with machinery for bread, biscuits, 
        pastry and confectionery. For Joseph Baker & Sons, these exhibitions 
        were the most effective form of advertising and on some occasions the 
        exhibits actually paid their way from the sale of products made during 
        the exhibition. 
Besides exhibiting full size machinery – "the most complete 
        exhibit of modern bread, cake and biscuit making machinery, and continuous 
        baking ovens, in the world" – they also showed, in a large 
        glass case, a miniature bakery with ancillary plant, "working with 
        the precision of a watch". This model was later put on view in the 
        entrance hall at 58 City Road.
(For more details see Trade 
        Exhibitions)
In 1889, machinery was exhibited in Melbourne with such success that 
        an office was opened there – the start of a long association of 
        the company with Australasia. (See also History 
        of Baker Perkins in Australasia)
The Move to Willesden
The company had by now acquired an international standing and repute 
        and its foreign trade grew rapidly. As a consequence, it soon outgrew 
        the City Road premises and in 1890 a move was made to a large, newly built 
        engineering works in Hythe Road, Willesden, where it remained for the 
        next 43 years. A series of photographs of the Willesden factory can be 
        found in Before 
        Westwood. 
It is interesting to note what were considered to be the keys to their 
        growing success;
"They took out more patents; they made their products more readily 
        adaptable to the requirements of the trade; they missed no opportunity 
        of coming into touch with those who were likely to welcome their machines; 
        they gradually, though with infinite difficulty, accumulated the capital 
        they required".
Death of the Founder
The business suffered a great blow in January 1892 with the death of 
        its founder, Joseph Baker. He had, characteristically, insisted on attending 
        a special meeting of the Society of Friends, despite the worst of weather 
        and caught a chill, followed by that year’s virulent influenza.      
"His simple personal ways, his self-sacrificing industry in everything 
        he took in hand, his transparent integrity in business as in all other 
        matters, his affectionate interest in the lives and welfare of his men, 
        above all, his unfailing gentleness in every relationship with his fellow-men 
        – these qualities had set an example and a standard which were an 
        inspiration to every member of the firm".
His place was, indeed, hard to fill. His eldest son, J. Allen Baker took 
        over the running of the firm and soon found himself under considerable 
        pressure. He was, however, ably supported by his three brothers: William 
        King Baker, the closest to J. Allen in age - who looked after the accounts; 
        George Samuel Baker, the third brother – who inherited the inventiveness 
        of his father and took care of the technical side of the business; and 
        the youngest brother, Philip Barton Baker – with a natural bent 
        for travel, who won customers in many parts of the world.








Joseph Allen Baker
William King Baker
George Samuel Baker
Philip Barton Baker


Augustus Muir states: "These four brothers had each his own contribution
          to make to the growth of the firm. After death had deprived them of
          the wise and benevolent leadership of their father, they continued
          to work closely together, as if he were still among them, putting in
          his quiet word to calm a fraternal dispute - for, indeed, there were
          disputes in plenty. But however hotly they differed in private as they
          hammered out some important decision; to the outside world they presented
          a united front."
The Deed of Partnership signed, on the death
        of their father, by which Joseph Allen Baker, William King Baker, George
        Samuel Baker agreed to take Philip Barton Baker into partnership with
        them in the business - Joseph Baker & Sons.
BANK 376 and HARLESDEN 3





Page from the   1897 London Telephone Directory


Always at the fore-front of the application of new technology, it   comes as no surprise that Joseph Baker & Sons were quick to get onto the new   fangled telephone system that had first been introduced in London in 1879 (see   P17 of the 1897/98 Directory above and here, for more details   of the growth of the telephone system). BANK 376 served its City Road address   and the Harlesden number would reach the Willesden factory.
Expanding Sales
One of the key export salesmen at this time was Robert Bruce Hay who 
        blazed the trail for Baker Perkins in South America. He has been described 
        as the most colourful personality the Group has ever employed. During 
        his first period of employment at Joseph Baker & Sons his exploits 
        were legendary as he would sell anything to make an honest cent. He caused 
        Willesden to build a crematorium in Brazil that never worked; he sold 
        two river steamers, startling the directors at home, but the vessels were 
        duly delivered; he arranged the lighting of a town; he crossed the Andes 
        by mule and organised a hotel in Santiago as a hospital in a yellow fever 
        epidemic. 
As far as the crematorium is concerned, it is possible that   the Company relied too heavily on their core food processing technology as it is   said that Westwood was perturbed to receive a cable from Robert Bruce Hay simply   stating -  "Bodies bake won't   burn instructions please".
Claude Dumbleton said of him – "I don’t think 
        personalities of Robert Hay’s type would fit very well into our 
        business today – he was a complete individualist who would not work 
        in a team and, I imagine, a very, very expensive operator". Robert 
        Hay was a director of the company from 1910 to 1912 but left to become 
        a director of Carson’s Chocolates before returning to Willesden 
        later as Commercial Manager. He had rooted a Baker Perkins presence in 
        South America which exists to the present day. (See also History 
        of Baker Perkins in Brazil.)
Although the company’s foreign trade had increased significantly, 
        curiously enough, very little had been achieved in the USA. It had been 
        found necessary to concentrate on the United Kingdom and Europe, the Canadian 
        and American connections having been wound up. However, the announcement 
        that a World’s Fair would be held in Chicago in 1893 prompted thoughts 
        of finding another market in the Middle West. It was resolved to send 
        a large exhibit to Chicago, regardless of cost.



The Joseph Baker & Sons stand at the 1893 Chicago   Exhibition


This was an ambitious enterprise and J. Allen Baker considered himself 
        as the proper person to carry it through. He therefore left his younger 
        brothers for more than a year to carry on at home alone. The Fair proved 
        a great success with very good day-to-day financial returns. Its success 
        with local businessmen was greater still and business continually increased, 
        not only in the USA but in other, so far, untouched countries as well. 
        It could be said that, from the date of the Chicago Fair, the company’s 
        business was established on a solid long-lasting, international basis.
To add credence to the above, the   following appeared in the Daily Mail of 3rd December 1902:
"ENGLAND HELPS HER   OWN"
"In these days of well-heralded foreign trade successes it is   refreshing to have to chronicle British commercial triumphs in one   direction.  In biscuit-making, as is well   known, England stands unrivalled.    Reading, now a great industrial centre, has been built upon biscuits, and   one house alone in this trade makes a profit of about a third of a million a   year.  In an allied engineering industry   we are equally to the front.  The making   of ovens for biscuit and cake manufacturers is a trade by itself, and we have   the cream of the world’s business in it.
One English house alone – Joseph Baker and Sons, of Willesden –   has established so large an export trade, with the United States, despite the   handicap of a forty-five per cent, duty, that it has now opened manufacturing   for its American branch in Chicago, and contemplates immediately starting   another American house.  The reasons of   success here have been plain.  In the   first place, the firm has among its members an inventive genius.  Secondly, it has systematically encouraged   its men to think out improvements, and has made it worth their while to do   so.  This house has secured its place not   by driving, but by establishing cordial relations between employers and   employed.  It boasts that it has never   had a strike, and it was among the first, if not actually the first, to   establish an eight-hour day.  This,   however, has since been modified to a fifty-hour week".
Business Philosophy
It is an essential part of telling the story of Baker Perkins to allow 
        descriptions of its basic ethos and management style to surface regularly 
        throughout the narrative to show that this was no accident but a fundamental 
        part of the basic philosophy of the company. A biography of J.Allen Baker 
        states:
"With their roots in their Quaker beliefs, the business methods of 
        Joseph Baker and his sons were sometimes seen as unusual, but they succeeded 
        in their own peculiar way. They refused to attract clients by the method 
        of "treating" and their refusal brought them not failure but respect. 
        They treated their workers with consideration and through all the worst 
        periods of industrial trouble they rarely had a strike. In all their work 
        they practised rigid economy in personal and overhead expense; thus in 
        the early years they always took a sandwich lunch to save the cost of 
        restaurant meals. The harmony and confidence between Joseph Baker and 
        his sons was often spoken of by others as a factor in their success. They 
        were fortunate to have around them a splendid office staff – Allen 
        Baker had a gift for choosing capable and energetic men – and it 
        was a staff that shared their ideas about the business and the responsibilities 
        it involved. But above all the other causes, the progress of the firm 
        was due to the determination of Allen Baker to make it the kind of success 
        that he believed that it could and ought to be. Beyond the desire for 
        reasonable comfort and education for his growing family, he now had in 
        it a deeper purpose. His machines were to help to end the shameful conditions 
        in which hundreds of thousands of his fellow men had worked; they were 
        to raise the standard of public sanitation in food production; they were 
        to lower the cost of living for the poor".
The Bakers were justifiably immensely proud of the change that they had 
        been able to bring about in the food industry and this is best summed 
        up by taking, somewhat out of chronological context, the preface to the 
        1915 edition of the company’s sales catalogue:
"AMONGST THE GREAT CHANGES OF THE PAST FIFTY YEARS THERE ARE FEW, IF 
        ANY, WHICH WERE MORE NEEDED OR HAVE BEEN MORE MARKED THAN THOSE CONNECTED 
        WITH THE PREPARATION AND PRODUCTION OF ARTICLES OF FOOD, OF WHICH OUR 
        DAILY BREAD IS STILL THE CHIEF.
IT IS BETWEEN FORTY AND FIFTY YEARS SINCE THE FOUNDER OF THIS FIRM BEGAN 
        TO DIRECT HIS THOUGHTS AND INVENTIVE GENIUS TOWARDS THE SOLUTION OF SOME 
        OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH HAD TO BE FACED IN PROVIDING FOR THE ACCURATE, CLEAN 
        AND AUTOMATIC CARRYING OUT OF THE VARIOUS PROCESSES IN THE MAKING OF BREAD, 
        MANY OF WHICH HAD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD’S HISTORY BEEN LABORIOUS 
        AND PROSTRATING, AND, IN MANY CASES, INJURIOUS TO THE HEALTH OF THOSE 
        EMPLOYED THEREIN.
THESE CONDITIONS HAD THEIR LONG CONTINUANCE, PERHAPS, BECAUSE OF THE 
        UNUSUAL CHARACTER OF THE DIFFICULTIES TO BE OVERCOME, THE MATERIALS IN 
        THE PROCESS OF BREAD MAKING POSSESSING SOMETHING OF THE NATURE OF LIFE 
        THROUGH THE ACTION OF THE YEAST, WITH ALL THE VARYING CONDITIONS AND RAPID 
        CHANGES INCIDENTAL THERETO.
THE ILLUSTRATED TIMES OF 31ST JANUARY, 1863, IN DRAWING PUBLIC ATTENTION 
        TO THE UNSATISFACTORY STATE OF THE TRADE AT THE TIME, WROTE:
"IT IS NOT A LITTLE STRANGE THAT, IN THE MIDST OF INVENTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS 
        WHICH HAVE AFFECTED ALMOST THE WHOLE COURSE OF OUR DAILY LIVES, THERE 
        SHOULD TILL LATELY HAVE BEEN SCARCELY ANY CHANGE IN THE ART AND PRACTICE 
        OF MAKING THE BREAD UPON WHICH OUR EXISTENCE MAY BE SAID IN A GREAT MEASURE 
        TO DEPEND.
 THE REPORT MADE BY MR. TREMENHEERE TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN REFERENCE 
        TO THE CONDITION OF THE JOURNEYMAN BAKERS, INVOLVED OTHER QUESTIONS BESIDES 
        THOSE OF SEVERE LABOUR AND SUFFERINGS OF THE JOURNEYMAN BAKERS THEMSELVES."
PROGRESS FOR A TIME WAS SLOW AND PARTIAL, BUT RECEIVED A DISTINCT IMPETUS 
        AFTER THE FAMOUS HEALTH EXHIBITION OF 1884, WHEN THIS FIRM HAD ITS MODELS 
        AND A LARGE NUMBER OF ITS MACHINES SHOWN IN THE VARIOUS EXHIBITS OF THE 
        BAKERIES BUILDING WHICH WAS PLACED BESIDE THE THEN PRINCE OF WALES’ 
        (KING EDWARD VII) PAVILION. AND IT WAS FROM A GREAT GATHERING OF THE PRINCIPAL 
        BAKERS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IRELAND, ON THE INVITATION OF THE EXHIBITING 
        BAKERY ENGINEERS, THAT THE FIRST UNITED FORWARD STEP WAS TAKEN, AND SHORTLY 
        AFTER THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED.
IN VIEW OF THE VARYING CONDITIONS IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES AND THE SPECIAL 
        FEATURES OF THE TRADE, NO ONE CAN DENY THAT A CHANGE, WONDERFUL IN CHARACTER 
        AND COMPLETENESS, HAS BEEN WROUGHT. THE GENERAL ADOPTION OF MODERN PLANT 
        MAKING POSSIBLE SANITARY AND ECONOMICAL METHODS HAS, HOWEVER, ONLY BECOME 
        AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY WITHIN A COMPARATIVELY SHORT PERIOD, ALTHOUGH FOR 
        SOME TIME CERTAIN MACHINES AND PLANT FOR PARTIALLY CARRYING OUT THE WORK 
        MECHANICALLY HAVE BEEN IN USE.
THE FIRST COMPLETELY AUTOMATIC CARRYING OUT OF THE WHOLE OF THE PROCESSES 
        WAS DEVELOPED BY THIS COMPANY THROUGH ITS CANADIAN BUSINESS, BUT WAS RAPIDLY 
        EXTENDED TO THE GREAT BAKERIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND AUSTRALASIA, AND 
        HAS NOW TAKEN A FIRM HOLD HERE AT HOME IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
ILLUSTRATIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INSTALLATIONS WILL BEST CONVEY 
        A CORRECT APPRECIATION OF HOW IMPORTANT AND COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENTS 
        HAVE BEEN, WHICH ARE NOW INEVITABLY CHANGING THE MAKING OF THE BREAD INTO 
        THE SAME HYGIENIC AND ACCURATE SYSTEM OF FACTORY PRODUCTION THAT AT AN 
        EARLIER DATE TOOK PLACE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MANUFACTURE AND PRODUCTION 
        OF BISCUITS.
IT IS DIFFICULT TO GIVE WRITTEN DESCRIPTIONS WHICH CAN ADEQUATELY CONVEY 
        THE FACTS. IT MAY, HOWEVER, BE SAID THAT IN NO BUSINESS PRESENTING SO 
        MANY FORMIDABLE DIFFICULTIES, HAS THERE BEEN MORE COMPLETE SUCCESS OR 
        THE PRODUCTION OF MORE INGENIOUS, PRACTICAL AND ABSOLUTELY AUTOMATIC PLANT 
        THAN THAT NOW MADE BY THIS COMPANY FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF BREAD."
The Baker Management Culture at Willesden
A "family" atmosphere prevailed from the start. All of the Baker family 
        lived near to the works and were involved in all of the social activities 
        of the workpeople. The welfare of the employees was of deep concern to 
        the Bakers – they had celebrated Queen Victoria’s Diamond 
        Jubilee in 1887 by shortening the working day by one hour with no reduction 
        in pay, and had persuaded employees to contribute to the later National 
        Health Insurance and Unemployment stamp schemes (4d. weekly for the Health 
        stamp and 2½d. for the Unemployment stamp) by increasing wages 
        by 6d. a week.
There was little regimentation and a rather loose organisation on the 
        shop floor but the workers were eager to give of their best and craftsmanship 
        was of the highest order. Perhaps the relaxed atmosphere and the lack 
        of a precise costing system had an effect on profits but "it would have 
        been hard to find a happier team of workmen in England".
(NOTE: Reference to The 
        Westwood Works Culture will indicate that this very enlightened management 
        style emanated not only from the Baker family but was endorsed and developed 
        by F.C. Ihlee of Werner Pfleiderer & Perkins after the 1919 merger).
Broadening the Product Line
The company was quick to see opportunities to improve production methods 
        in many parts of the food industry but often entered the market by selling 
        other companies’ products before developing its own designs. An 
        increasingly wide range of equipment for the chocolate, biscuit and other 
        food industries was developed at or merchanted from Willesden and they 
        soon became the source of any equipment which the shopkeeper, biscuit 
        maker or confectioner could possibly need. Some idea of the breadth of 
        product range being offered by Joseph Baker & Sons at the time can 
        be obtained from the Index to their 1915 Sales Catalogue shown below:









Mention is made in The 
        Origins of the Founders that Jacob Perkins and Joseph Baker could 
        never have met. It is worthy of note that in the eighteen-eighties, Joseph 
        Baker & Sons were agents for the Perkins steam ovens. This would suggest 
        that the first meeting between members of the Baker and Perkins families 
        might have been between Loftus Perkins, just before he died in 1891, and 
        Joseph Baker, just before he died in 1892.
In the context of comparing Baker and Perkins product lines, among the 
        thousands of products shown in the Joseph Baker & Sons catalogue of 
        the late 1890s, there appears an illustration of a 250 IHP Compound Horizontal 
        Coupled Steam Engine. There is nothing in the illustration or elsewhere 
        in the catalogue to suggest the maker. The same publication shows a complete 
        range of "Improved Otto Cycle Gas and Oil Engines". Each of these bears 
        a "Joseph Baker & Sons, London" nameplate but no evidence has yet 
        been found that any of these engines were actually made at Willesden. 
        It is more likely that they constitute an early example of "OEM" marketing.      

















 


Steam and Oil Engines sold by Joseph 
          Baker & Sons in the late 1890s.


Joseph Baker & Sons became a Limited Liability Company in 1902 with 
        an authorised capital of £200,000 in £5 shares. These were 
        retained by the four Baker brothers who formed the board and16,000 six 
        per cent Cumulative Preference shares were offered to the public. 
With incorporation came the need for the company to produce an Annual 
        Report to its shareholders. In the early days, the Annual Report was a 
        fairly brief 4-page document with only a very few paragraphs describing 
        the company's performance in a "Report of the Directors" on 
        the first page, followed by two pages of the Balance Sheet and Profit 
        and Loss Account. The final page gave details of the date and venue of 
        the AGM. This possibly reflected the minimum level of information required 
        by law. There was little change in the format or content of the Annual 
        Report over the next 15 years. 
NOTE: A complete set of Annual Reports exists for Joseph Baker & 
        Sons from the year of incorporation, through the merger with Perkins Engineers 
        in 1920, the name change to Baker Perkins in 1923 and until the first 
        years of the APV era. An analysis of both the form and content of these 
        will be found in The Annual 
        Report. A year by year digest of the highlights of each year’s 
        trading, the key developments and the growth in profits will be found 
        in The Directors’ 
        Statements.
A Flirtation with the Transport Business



“Stevens-Duryea” 
              Car


It is not surprising that, like other members of what was to become
        the  Baker Perkins Group, Joseph Baker & Sons Ltd should have taken
        an  interest in the motor car (see also Rose Brothers and Job Day) It
        is understood  that, in around 1902, the company held an agency for the
        American “Stevens-Duryea”. 
        The illustration shows a 7 HP model with J.S. Baker in the driving seat
         and A.R. Baker as passenger. Some sales  literature from the period
        is shown below. 






This was not a successful venture
        and Stevens Duryea later created their own UK sales outlet business in
        Coventry We understand that, in 1904, members of the Baker family became
        owners of three of the first nine cars registered in Britain.

A3 was bought
          by Joseph Allen Baker
A6
          was owned by George Samuel Baker
A9
          - a red de Dion Bouton - went to Philip Barton Baker.

It is not yet known if the manufacturer of the cars registered as A3
      and A6 was Stevens Duryea.
It is understood that this was not the company’s only flirtation 
        with motor transport. In around 1910, it was decided to give up delivering 
        machines to the docks by horse and cart and go in for the new motor lorry. 
        George Baker, however, refused to buy one as “we are engineers” 
        and he commissioned W.F. Prescott, the chief draughtsman, to design and 
        build one. The engine was a flat twin of about 2000cc with copper water 
        jackets and a 3-speed and reverse epicyclic gearbox. The lorry ran until 
        about 1920.
Entering the Chocolate & Confectionery Business
 (See also History 
        of Baker Perkins in the C+C Business)
 It was in the early days at Willesden that Bakers first entered the 
        field of chocolate making machinery, not at first of their own design 
        but later producing machinery capable of manufacturing a ton of chocolate 
        per day. Another key product was the "drop" biscuit machine, capable of 
        producing a whole range of biscuit shapes by simple changing of the dies, 
        and needing only empty trays to be loaded, full trays removed and the 
        dough box refilled periodically – for its time a sophisticated piece 
        of automation. A "hard and soft dough biscuit gauging and cutting machine," 
        described as the most compact and complete of its kind, and a cutting 
        and stamping machine for American crackers was also part of the product 
        line.
The Birth of the Wafer Oven
The third Baker son, George Samuel Baker, proved to be a very able inventor, 
        developing an automatic baking machine for sugar wafers. A continuous 
        circuit of plates carried the wafer batter through the gas-heated baking 
        chamber within five minutes and, since it "reduced labour costs by five-sixths, 
        gas by two-thirds and needed only half of one horse-power to drive it", 
        Bakers claimed that "no baker without this machine could compete against 
        rivals who had installed it." George Samuel’s basic design remained 
        essentially unchanged for the next sixty years, sales of wafer ovens being 
        a feature of Baker Perkins’ business long after WW2. George Baker 
        became Chief Engineer at Willesden and designed automatic bread plants 
        of which a later director said "The only advantage the modern counterparts 
        have is the use of electrical and pneumatic techniques for synchronisation 
        and transfers".
Although the work produced at Willesden was surprisingly varied, the 
        directors were always on the look-out for new ideas. It was during this 
        period that a number of key innovations and their inventors were taken 
        into the "family". A.W. Copland, with lifelong experience of the biscuit 
        industry in the USA, had invented a depositor "which made biscuits of 
        two colours, of two doughs or a piece filled with jam" and this became 
        an important part of the Baker Perkins product line, being produced throughout 
        the life of the company. Copland also brought with him the "Simplex" depositor 
        which could handle the lightest of doughs and which also remained in production 
        for many years. A few years later, Philip Baker introduced another American, 
        T.L. Green, and his "continuous cutting machine, wire cut machine and 
        sheeter". These too were taken up and successfully sold.
Other introductions included the development, at the request of Macfarlane 
        (later Macfarlane Lang), of direct gas-firing for the travelling-chain 
        biscuit oven in collaboration with the gas equipment specialists, Keith 
        Blackman; the Baker-Carr automatic biscuit icing and sandwiching machine 
        in collaboration with Carrs of Carlisle and, on the sugar confectionery 
        side of the business, Edward Metcalfe Shaw’s "Eureka" sugar boiling 
        device, later (in 1908), developed into a double vacuum version, became 
        the cornerstone of sweet manufacturing.
The First Travelling Bread Oven
Also in 1908 an even more significant event occurred. The first travelling 
        oven for bread was produced in response to an order from Harrison Brothers 
        of Montreal. 
(NOTE: THE TERM "TRAVELLING OVEN" IS USED HERE TO DESCRIBE A BAKING OVEN 
        THROUGH WHICH THE PRODUCT IS CARRIED ON A CONTINUOUSLY MOVING CONVEYOR 
        BELT AS OPPOSED TO THE "STATIONARY" OVENS THAT WERE IN COMMON USE AT THE 
        TIME. THESE OVENS SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH THE "PORTABLE" OVENS, CARRIED 
        ON ROAD WHEELS, THAT WERE INTRODUCED IN THE LATE 1800’S AND USED 
        TO BAKE BREAD FOR THE ARMED FORCES IN BOTH WORLD WARS (SEE WESTWOOD 
        WORKS IN WW1 AND WESTWOOD 
        WORKS IN WW2). 
Baker Perkins had produced travelling ovens for biscuit production but 
        this was the first time one had been used to bake bread. It caused an 
        instant sensation with American bakers. 
George Samuel Baker achieved another significant success when, in 1912, 
        the Ward Baking Company of Chicago ordered a travelling oven and a pre-oven 
        unit to make a fully automatic bread plant. George Baker and his son, 
        Ralph, put all their energies into designing and manufacturing this plant 
        and then supervised its installation in Chicago. The expected teething 
        troubles required several months to get over but, despite the Ward directors’ 
        misgivings, George and Ralph’s determination, together with a triumph 
        of persuasion by Joseph Allen Baker, led to the Ward directors ordering 
        two more plants before the original installation was in full working order. 
        Claude Dumbleton, a pupil of George Baker and later a director of Baker 
        Perkins pointed out that: "Electrical and pneumatic techniques for 
        synchronisation and transfers are the only advantages which modern counterparts 
        have over George Baker’s original design."
The years prior to WW1 were characterised by an increase in business. 
        Sales had grown steadily until 1912 when profits reached a record £24,729 
        – despite some set-backs in the business environment. Investment 
        in production facilities continued and by 1913 the much improved buildings 
        and plant were estimated to be worth £120,000. Sales had risen by 
        around 50% to £160,000 and, despite the investment in plant and 
        tools, manufacturing capacity could not keep pace with orders, hitting 
        profits significantly. Increases in the cost of materials and wages also 
        had an effect. The company now employed 350. 
Pre-War Business Growth
Growth following the move to Willesden was very rapid.   From 1891, when total sales stood at £46,000 and the number of men employed was   about 150, the firm grew by 1900 to employ 350 with sales of £110,000. At this   time, the output of the Company was:

36% - Chocolate, Sweet and Jam Machinery.   
        27% - Biscuit Machinery and ovens.   
        13% - Bakery Supplies; Bread Tins; Shop Fittings;   etc.   
        9% - Bread Machinery and Ovens.   
        9% - General Machinery.   
        6% - Sundries, inc. engines, shafting and   repairs.

Expansion continued up to the beginning of WW1 with a   particularly rapid increase in the Bakery Machinery and Oven business. By 1913,   total sales were £160,000 consisting of:

31% - Chocolate, Sweet and Jam machinery.   
        30% - Biscuit Machinery and Ovens.   
        21% - Bakery Machinery and Ovens.   
        *% - General Machinery.   
        6% - Sundries, inc. Engines, shafting and   repairs.   
        3% - Bakery supplies and Shop Fittings.

This latter activity was discontinued shortly   after.
Negotiations for a Merger Begin
It was in about 1913 that the first discussions took place with Werner, 
        Pfleiderer & Perkins Ltd of Peterborough regarding the possibility 
        of a merger between the two companies. An account of these talks and the 
        events leading up to the union can be found in History 
        of Joseph Baker Sons & Perkins.

        Works in WW1)



1914: Mr Allen R. Baker (4th from right) with the Ambulance Service 
            at Ypres


Inevitably, the idea of Willesden being involved in munitions manufacture 
        did not sit comfortably with the Quaker principles of the four Baker brothers 
        but these feelings conflicted with their strong feeling of patriotism. 
        In 1914, the younger generation – J. Allen Baker’s eldest 
        son, Allan Richard Baker, and his youngest brother, Philip John Baker, 
        determined to aid those who suffered in the conflict, organised the Friend’s 
        Ambulance Unit based at the Quaker Centre at Jordans in Buckinghamshire. 
        Sixty Quakers were trained in the tasks required of an ambulance unit 
        on active service at the front and were sent to Dunkirk, Woesten, Poeringhe 
        and Ypres.A year later, the first British Ambulance Unit for Italy was 
        formed and within six weeks of laying plans, a convoy of ambulances were 
        on the way to the front where the Italians were fighting the Austrians.      
 A third brother, Joseph Samuel, held different views and joined the 
        Leinster Regiment – much against his father’s will – 
        rose to the rank of major and was severely wounded. - shot through the 
        knee - but went back to the front after some months’ convalescence, 
        with the rank of Major and the job of inspecting bakeries for the troops. 
        Joe Baker never fully recovered from his wound – arthritis set in 
        and his disability increased year by year. 

Tower Wood





 


It was a desire to build a log cabin to remind himself and his family
        of their Canadian roots that persuaded William King Baker to purchase
        Tower Wood, one hundred acres of ancient woodland in Burnham Beeches,
        Buckinghamshire.  William and his wife, both from Quaker families,
        had left Canada for London to join the family business of Joseph Baker & Sons
      in the late 1800s.   
A great great niece of the family, Mary Jo Darrah, supplied further
        information about William, whose many books and poems about Canada are
        still available today.  The cabin he built with the help of his
        sons and a hired man in the early years of the 20th century consisted
        of one large living room with walls made from tree trunks with bark intact.  Bedrooms,
        a kitchen and a primitive bathroom were added around the sides.  A
        huge veranda was in constant use in fine weather and the vast log fire
        in the centre of the cabin was enjoyed by all during the cold winter
        months.  William bought an old tram, which was broken up, and bits
        and pieces were scattered everywhere.  The ugly tram seats were
        set along the wall of the veranda and the curving stairs were attached
        to the side of a huge iron water tank he had installed beside the house.  This
        served as a swimming pool and around it he built a sort of dressing room
        from planks. This tank, in which children learned to swim, was very,
      very deep. 
The London Borough of Sutton Library is currently involved in research
        into conscientious objectors during World War One through work regarding
        a Quaker, Robert George Pursaill, who had served in the Friends Ambulance
        Unit in France.   This gentleman was caught up in a bomb blast and
        was sent back to England suffering from shell shock and loss of memory.  His
        daughter’s family memoirs tell that the family was sent to Tower
        Wood to convalesce in the cabin built by William King Baker. She describes
        the cabin as being very basic, but over time the family seems to have
        been joined by a number of other shell shocked soldiers  These men
        apparently received visits from William. We have heard that the cabin
        was used as an officers’ mess during World War Two when additions
        were made, (See below) and, in 1995, it housed the ranger who looks after
      Burnham Beeches.
Two other members of the Baker family, Allan and Philip (known after
        his marriage as Noel Baker) and other friends organised the Friends’ Ambulance
        Unit, first in France and then in Italy. Philip was the moving spirit
        and he issued the first appeal for volunteers in ‘The Friend’ during
        1914.  He served in France and then set up the Italian unit with
        George Trevelyan for which William’s father, Joseph Allan Baker,
      then an MP, helped to raise funds.

The ancient woodland of Burnham Beeches is a much-loved area
            of recreation and beauty, but many are unaware of the prominent part
            it played in the Second World War Today it is a scenic
            area of woodland, open space and outstanding natural beauty, popular
            among walkers and rich in wildlife. But in the mid-1940s Burnham
            Beeches was a hub of military activity as Vehicle Reserve Depot Number
            Two during the Second World War.
It is said that, when passing through Slough by train, then Prime Minister,
        Winston Churchill apparently saw army vehicles being stored near the
        railway station and decided they were vulnerable to enemy bombers. The
        nation's leader suggested the Beeches as a suitable place to hide the
        vehicles and in May 1942 large parts of the site were requisitioned by
        the war department.
Most of the wooded area as well as a large part of East Burnham Common
        were taken over and used for the marshalling of vehicles destined for
        the D-Day landings. At any one time there were up to 10,000 vehicles
        parked under the trees with American tank transporters lined up between
        Beeches Road and Victory Cross, while Burnham Walk and Dukes Drive were
        used for vehicles weighing more than three tons. 
Barbed wire was placed around the Beeches as a security measure but
        some of the more inquisitive villagers were not deterred. Local people
        were used to using the woods but when they found they didn't have their
        open space any more, some of the local  children found a way of
        getting underneath the wire and soon, stories of what was hidden in the
        woods were being circulated creating a significant security problem
More than 300 people served at the woodland including electrical and
        mechanical engineers, the Royal Army Service Corps and women from the
        Auxiliary Territorial Service. It was not until November 1947 before
        large parts of Burnham Beeches were open again to the public.
[WITH ACKNOWLEDGMENTS TO THE BURNHAM ADVERTISER]
Despite the dislocation of business owing to the war and the decrease
        of output caused by 100 employees joining the forces, the year’s
        trading in 1914 was satisfactory. A lease and right of purchase was obtained
        for five acres of land belonging to the London and North Western Railway
      adjoining the Willesden Works. 
The British Government was slow in organising industry on to a war footing 
        and it was not until April 1916 that the firm was taken over as a Controlled 
        Establishment under the Munitions Act. All normal work gave way to the 
        machining of six-inch shell forgings – between 1,500 and 2,000 per 
        week (more than half of the company's machine tools being converted for 
        this task) - the manufacture of cordite mixers, tank links and gun parts. 
        Later in the war, aeroplane machinery and margarine machinery were also 
        produced.
All this required considerable change and further investment. Machine 
        tools were converted and special equipment designed towards the cost of 
        which the Ministry of Munitions advanced £30,000. George Baker designed 
        special lathes and, because over 200 regular employees were by then serving 
        in the Armed Forces or doing other forms of war work, women were quickly 
        trained to bore shell cases. Of the three full time shifts running at 
        the time, a large proportion of the work-force were London women. Although 
        this was considered revolutionary by many, shocking by some, without the 
        aid of women in the factories the War might have dragged on for much longer 
        than four years.



Women Employees at Willesden in 1918.


Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, the directors at Willesden had 
        tried to persuade the War Office that using equipment for the mechanical 
        preparation of dough and baking loaves to feed the troops on active service 
        was practical and would, by replacing the old field ovens, free up more 
        men for active service. The story of this, and the subsequent collaboration 
        with Werner, Pfleiderer & Perkins, can be found in Westwood 
        Works in WW1 and History of Joseph 
        Baker Sons & Perkins. (See also pages 64 to 65 of "The History 
        of Baker Perkins" by Augustus Muir.)
1916 was also the year that the company suffered a major blow with the 
        death, at the age of 51, of the man in charge of the commercial direction 
        of the firm, Philip Barton Baker. The youngest of the four Baker brothers, 
        Philip Barton Baker had the task of holding the balance between his siblings, 
        smoothing out many a difficult situation. He was described by a colleague 
        as "a man of outstanding character, gentle but at the same time very 
        firm, a man who knew his mind".
The Company's Annual Reports for the last half of WW1 indicate   that, despite the difficult circumstances created by shortages of materials and   manpower, its financial performance was quite satisfactory:
December 1917 A/R – “Your Directors are of the opinion that the   year’s results are satisfactory considering the constant rise in wages, many of   them retrospective, and the difficulties in obtaining regular supplies of   necessary material. The results are also affected by the considerable sums which   have been written off for plant especially installed for Government   work”.
December 1918 A/R – J.Allen Baker   died.
“The signing of the Armistice in November last foreshadowed the   completion of the Company’s Government work. The results as shown in the   accounts for the year are, in the opinion of your directors, satisfactory.   Provision has been made for depreciation, and a larger sum than usual has been   carried forward, with a view to meeting any contingent liability to excess   profits duty. Since the Armistice the work of renovating and remodelling of   plant has been carried out as rapidly as possible and, in spite of the   difficulties of the time, your Directors anticipate that the Works will shortly   be in full production of the Company’s   specialities”.
December 1919 A/R – “Many difficulties have had to be overcome,   chief among which are restitution of plant for peace time activities at   Willesden, liquidation of War Contracts, difficulty in obtaining material and   thirteen weeks of moulders’ strike. The relatively favourable result obtained   nevertheless is largely due to the availability of good foundry facilities at   Peterborough and the absence of the need for any serious reconditioning of plant   at those Works”.
The Death of Joseph Allen Baker
The end of the war also saw the death of the Chairman, Joseph Allen Baker. 
        He had a very full life attaining not only a significant reputation in 
        the engineering world but, as a lifelong worker for world peace, the stature 
        of a truly international figure. He was returned as the Liberal Member 
        of Parliament for Finsbury in 1905 "in the most decisive victory for either side in the   history of the constituency".  The result was received in the   constituency  - "with an enthusiasm impossible to describe". However   even this did not touch him as much as the welcome from his employees at   Willesden as , when he arrived on the scene - "all the men in the various   shops used their tools to hammer out a clamorous chorus of sound, the ringing   blows of the blacksmiths on their anvils sounding high above the rest." The sum total of his achievements 
        in public life would take more space than is available here so we will 
        have to be content with a quote from Augustus Muir’s "History of 
        Baker Perkins":
"Joseph Allen Baker was indeed an example of Kipling’s man 
        who "walked with kings nor lost the common touch’. Throughout all 
        his life he possessed the deep affection of his work-people, and would 
        cheerfully name them wherever they met. One of them wrote: "Top hat on 
        the back of his head, tails of his frock coat flying, he would rush up 
        the road after a morning’s work, and catch a tram for Wood Lane, 
        where he would board a tube train for Westminster’. It was suggested 
        that his public work must have deprived the firm of much of his attention; 
        but none knew better than his colleagues on the board that it was of high 
        value to the company to have as its chairman a man who, in business, combined 
        vision with unassailable integrity and was at the same time a statesman 
        and reformer of world renown".
He was succeeded as Chairman by his eldest son, Allan R. Baker. The signing 
        of the Armistice in November foreshadowed the completion of the Company’s 
        Government work, renovating and remodelling of plant was carried out rapidly 
        and the factory was soon in full production of the Company’s specialities.      
Following the war, the need to keep up the pace of new design and invention 
        was clear. Space was at a premium and Hinman Baker, the son of W. King 
        Baker, had been carrying out some experiments on the action of yeast in 
        bread in half of what had been the draughtsmen’s lavatory. He found 
        a combination of chemicals that improved the process and thus became the 
        founder, first manufacturer and salesman of what became British Arkady 
        Co. Ltd. The operation moved to the well known factory in Manchester but 
        the firm retained a financial interest in it until 1953 when its holding 
        was sold to the Ward Baking Company of America (see History 
        of British Arkady).
The area used for these experiments was later taken over by a gifted 
        young scientist, G.D. Wilson, who was given the task of setting up an 
        Experimental Department at Willesden. 
The Merger of Joseph Baker & Sons and Perkins Engineers
1919 was a period of joint working with Perkins Engineers Ltd, prior 
        to amalgamation. Many difficulties had to be overcome including the restitution 
        of plant for peacetime activities at Willesden and the liquidation of 
        war contracts. Just seven weeks after the war ended, the boards and staffs 
        of the two companies were in close co-operation, the two businesses effectively 
        running side by side and pooling profits. However it was nearly another 
        year before Baker and Perkins were trading as one company 
There were also inevitable difficulties in obtaining raw materials, this 
        not being helped by a thirteen weeks strike by moulders which affected both companies.        
In September 1919, the moulders and the ironfounders   found themselves engaged in a national strike for what was called a ‘living   wage’. As the strike set in and attitudes hardened and the men decided to   continue with their stance by an overwhelming vote. Much hardship was experienced by the iron workers and their   families but, faced with an unrelenting force of employers and acute starvation   as winter progressed, the ironfounders had to return to work in January 1920,   unfortunately with nothing gained, but importantly with nothing lost. 
The stoppage was particularly distressing as it was a national dispute, 
        not an internal disagreement, Allen R. Baker being at pains to inform 
        his shareholders that relations with workers and staff at all the company’s 
        locations were very good. Concern was exacerbated because the Baker directors 
        had hoped that the merger with Perkins would provide them with an efficient 
        foundry resource but it turned out that this was a department with which 
        F.C. Ihlee had never been satisfied. In the event, according to the 1919 
        Annual Report - "the relatively favourable financial result for the 
        year was attributed to the availability of the foundry facilities at Westwood 
        Works and the absence of any need for serious re-conditioning at Peterborough".      
The Acquisition of Saginaw
 (See also The History of Saginaw)
 Another momentous event occurred in 1919. A letter was received at Peterborough 
        from an ex-employee, George Hicks, giving the news that the newly built 
        factory of Werner & Pfleiderer in Hess Street, Saginaw, USA was about 
        to be sold. Ihlee rang Allan R. Baker who quickly determined that E.H. 
        Gilpin should go to Saginaw with Ihlee, using their judgment as to its 
        value and buying the factory if at all possible. As Atlantic passages 
        were impossible to book at short notice, the two men managed to get across 
        to the French coast where they boarded a small steamer carrying the first 
        American troops to be sent home after the Armistice. After lengthy negotiations, 
        and with Elmer Baker acting as their advisor, Gilpin and Ihlee acquired 
        the factory and equipment for $351,000.
Post-war Life at Willesden
John Prescott (who did not work for Baker Perkins), remembers his   grandfather - William Edward Prescott and his father  - Frederick William Prescott  - discussing their experiences of life at   Joseph Baker & Sons, Willesden and later at Peterborough. William was born   in 1875 and worked in Dover as an apprentice fitter until 1897. Brief spells at   the Post Office and Rowntrees, York followed and it is believed that he joined   Willesden as an “engineer’s draughtsman” in 1900/01. By the end of WW1, William   had been promoted to Chief Draughtsman and, as such, welcomed Stanley Gibbs to   the Company in 1924. Stanley remembers him as    - “a short sturdy little man who seemed to be very busy and always   anxious to hurry on”. A caricature of William can be seen here. Click here to see Stanley   Gibbs’s highly detailed memoir of his time at Willesden which provides a very   clear picture of life in the Willesden Drawing Office in the years between WW1   and the “Great Trek to Peterborough". A collection of   photographs both from inside and outside the factory, can be found in Before Westwood.
In around 1910, William was involved in a   flirtation with the automotive industry, producing from scratch, on instruction   from George Baker, a motor lorry to replace the horse and cart used to deliver   machinery to the docks.  See here.
William Prescott was followed into the company in 1910 by his son,   Frederick William Prescott. Frederick served in WW1, returning to the company in   1919 to work in the drawing office and works. By 1921 he was located at the   small export office in Kingsway, London, being appointed as a Bakery sales   representative in 1922. William made the “Great Trek” to Peterborough in 1933,   retiring in 1942 and Frederick,after spending around two years in Australia for   the Company, returned to England in early 1927, settling first in Kenton and   then in Pinner, retiring  in 1961.
Another long-serving Baker Perkins employee met William Prescott   at his interview with the company after leaving the Army at the end of the War   but seems to have made a less than favourable impression as John Prescott   recalls - "My grandfather told me of a chap, who, as he was going   out after his interview, was heard to mutter “…………. A land fit for heroes!”    William, who had pretty sharp hearing, called him back and said that he did not   like that talk" and – “You’re on trial; if you are any good you’ll stay”.   The “chap” was Claude Dumbleton who proved to be “some good”, stayed and   progressed to become a director of Baker Perkins and the powerhouse behind the   development of the world famous Baker Perkins Apprenticeship Scheme .
Claude Dumbleton, later to become Technical Director of Baker Perkins 
        from 1939 to 1963, joined Joseph Baker & Sons at Willesden in June 
        1919 after nearly five years in HM Forces, being one of “The fortunate   ones the ‘Angel of Mons’ did favour”. He leaves us a fascinating insight into some of the characters with 
        whom he worked. His first introduction to the company was via the front 
        gate of the Hythe Road factory and through the "commissionaire" – 
        "in the person of Bloxall, a man in a very old suit, a cloth cap and 
        minus one arm. Bloxall had no great welcome for anyone and seemed to spend 
        a major part of his time shooing stray dogs away from the gate with his 
        empty sleeve".
Claude Dumbleton also gives us a very clear insight into the   working conditions in the Drawing Office at Willesden - see here.
The head of the family business at the time was J. Allen Baker’s 
        first son, Allan Richard Baker – "an outstanding man". 
        George S. Baker (Joseph Baker’s third son) was Chief Engineer – 
        "and a very capable one at that", with Ralph Baker (George S. 
        Baker’s son) "virtually chief of designs under his father’s 
        direction" and W.E. Prescott as chief draughtsman. Bill Checketts, 
        the Pattern Shop foreman, "in common with many other foremen at Joseph 
        Baker & Sons, considered draughtsmen the lowest form of life – 
        they were never welcome in his shop". As mentioned earlier, George Wilson 
        – "a gifted young scientist" – ran the first Experimental 
        Department at Willesden. 
Claude Dumbleton also tells us that one of the problems that he faced 
        in one of his early tasks – producing a set of drawings for a biscuit 
        cutting machine – was that the drawings of castings did not agree 
        with the castings themselves. This was due to the patterns being frequently 
        altered in the Pattern Shop by George Baker, with the alterations being 
        recorded on a white-washed wall. Bill Checketts (see above) did all that 
        he could to prevent draughtsmen having access to "The Wall"!
In charge of the Accounts Department was Joseph Baker’s second 
        son, William King Baker. He had three sons in the company - Paul, Charles 
        and Hinman (the founder of British Arkady).
In the Commercial Office, E.H. Gilpin was – "the outstanding 
        man in the sales team". He was one of the main movers in the amalgamation 
        of Joseph Baker & Sons and Perkins Engineers in 1920. H. Kirman was 
        at one time Chairman of the Board of Management – "his energy 
        was unbounded and his capacity for work quite unparalleled". Robert 
        Hay as export salesman in South America has been mentioned earlier in 
        this history. Joseph Schaller operated mainly on the Continent on chocolate 
        and biscuit business.
Claude Dumbleton also mentions some "real Dickensian characters" 
        – Plater Tommy Donald – "who used to attend his job in 
        a greasy morning-coat, bowler hat, no collar or tie or socks – but 
        he was a magnificent worker". Alf Stower, the machine Shop foreman 
        – "wore a stiff upright collar, about 4", and a black 
        tie, and did much labouring and worked like a horse". Bill Brown, 
        the Cashier – "who always gave the impression when paying one’s 
        wages on Fridays that it was his money and not Joseph Baker & Sons’ 
        which was being dispensed". A. Cramb was Erecting Shop foreman and 
        – "the principal enemy of draughtsmen but he ruled his shop 
        with a rod of iron". The Carpenter foreman, S. Viant, entered Parliament 
        as a Labour MP for Willesden and was later Postmaster General.
