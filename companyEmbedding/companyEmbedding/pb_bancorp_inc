The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/).

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

7 Different Arrangements for Your Patio Furniture


Transforming your patio into the perfect outdoor entertaining area is as easy as rearranging your furniture and adding a few thoughtful touches.







Decorating with Baskets


Baskets are a simple way to add beauty and organization to your home.







Healthy Home


Find out how Pottery Barn can help you achieve a healthy home that benefits and betters your entire family.






Home FurnitureHome is that blissful place where you can kick off your shoes, put your feet up, and just be yourself, but if your furniture isn’t comfortable or looks out of place, you don’t get that sense of relief when you walk in the door. Purchasing furniture for your home lets you create the relaxed ambiance and character that makes an otherwise plain house feel like your home. Furnishings from Pottery Barn provide you with the quality you want and also give you that peaceful, at-home feeling so you can kick back and relax.Living Room FurnitureSet up your living room to suit your lifestyle. Position round end tables and round coffee tables within easy reach of sofas and sectionals to make your living room a functional living space. Arrange books and treasures in bookcases and shelves and encourage the family to gather around a game table or media center to create the kind of fun times that make great memories.Dining Room FurnitureThe kitchen or dining area is the hub of many family’s homes, so look for dining room furniture that completes your home’s decor. Store dishes and collectible items in a convenient dining room buffet or cabinet. Create a casual setting with a bar, stools and bar cart, or create an upscale dining area with a more traditional and formal dining table and chair set.Bedroom FurnitureWhile you want every room in your house to be pleasing and comfortable, your bedroom should be the most peaceful so you can rest well. Think about what makes you comfortable and what helps you stay organized when choosing new bedroom furniture. In addition to a comfortable mattress to sleep on and an appealing headboard, roomy bedside tables and dressers are practically a necessity in keeping an organized bedroom. Add an ottoman or stool at the end of your bed for some convenient extra seating.Home Office FurnitureStaying organized is a necessity when you work from home or need to study, so finding the right desk and modular system or filing cabinet for your needs can impact the success of your home business or study time. To easily coordinate your office space look for home office collections that have all the pieces you need in one package deal so everything matches to create a professional appearance.

Bedding
 
You're with your bedding longer than any other fabric, so why not love what you have? With the endless bedding options out there, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. Whether you are seeking to buy all bedding items including; comforters/duvets, sheets, pillows, quilts/blankets, decorative pillows, shams or bedskirts; or you want to keep it easy and buy it in one shot as a set to meet all your needs with minimal hassle - the thing to always keep in mind is that bedding and all its accessories should be unique to you. Here are some tips to help break it all down so you can stop feeling lost and start feeling empowered.
 
Is your bedroom decorated just the way you want? Or are you looking to add some style? If you are focused on complimenting the decor that you've already established in your room, you can usually stick to classic, complimentary colors and have more fun with the luxury options available for bedding. For example, you might want to stick with a cream duvet or comforter and splurge on soft, egyptian cotton sheets or a popular quilt in one of your favorite brands.
 
If you're looking to spruce up your entire room, have fun with a louder design on your bed cover. A matching accent pillow with extra blankets or throws make great accessories. Put some real thought into picking out your bed covers. Your bed can set the tone for your entire room, so you want to choose the perfect type that expresses your personality. A reversible cover is ideal if you're wanting to experiment with certain styles a little bolder than what you normally would. Get a solid color on one side for everyday, then decide when you're feeling a little more daring for that loud print.
 
An accent pillow is your friend and they're risk free. Try finding some in a cool shape or size, in addition to a pretty color. Think outside the box here and try some that contrast to what your bedding comes with. A duvet is a fun way to change out different styles when you're looking to experiment. After you find the duvet fill that you like, the rest is all about your mood and what styles you wish to bring out in your bedroom. There are gorgeous collections out there with many options, experiment with different brands and when you find the one with your favorite materials, see what they have to offer. This way you know the quality of what you're getting with your bed covers. All bedrooms are not created equal, so take the time to discover what fits your specific needs.

How to Choose the Right Entryway Rug


There are a few things to consider when choosing a rug, and your own personal style preference is arguably at the top of the list.







How to Hang a Drape


From the fabric you select to the hardware you choose, window treatments are an opportunity to define a room's style.







Hand of the Artist: Paisley


Our San Francisco Art Studio is home to tremendous creativity, where artists are encouraged to introduce new design ideas.






Rugs and WindowsAt Pottery Barn, our collections of rugs, drapery and custom shades allow you to accessorize your living space and truly make your house a home. Rugs are the perfect centerpiece in any living room or a colorful addition to a long hallway. They bring warmth to any wooden or stone flooring.

With elegant collections and made to order options, there is something for every home.Patterned rugsWe have a range of patterned rugs to make your home feel inviting and comfortable. From bold colors and geometric designs to more delicate patterns and neutral tones, embrace the artistic and the contemporary style patterned rugs can bring to your home.Bath RugsWith our collection of bath rugs, you can combine style with practicality. You can choose from soft and easy-to-clean cotton or memory foam materials, which is comfortable for bare feet and absorbs any water that escapes the tub. Non-slip backing also ensures that bath rugs stay in place and keeps your family safe from slips.Drapery CollectionsOur drapery collections allow you to coordinate you windows with your home decor, as well as block out light and create a cozy, private living space for you and your family. From our luxurious Belgian linen to our practical outdoor draperies, it is easy to find the perfect curtains and drapes to suit your color scheme.Custom ShadesOur made to order roll-down shades mean you can complement your decor and add an accessory to your windows. For those times when you want to block the glare or bright light that can shine into your home, custom shades filter sunlight and block out UV-rays, as well as add color and design to your living space.Window Hardware CollectionsTo hang drapes and curtains, you need reliable hardware to ensure they are positioned the way you want them. With our selection of window hardware collections, you can select durable curtain rods and knobs that suit your home decor and add a contemporary touch to the design.
