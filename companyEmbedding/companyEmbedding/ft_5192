                    Come and see the historic and cute boutique like style of old town, Kapaa.  Lined with coconut trees and boutique shops and restaurants this quant little town is my home.  I grew up on the East side of Kauai, the Kapaa area.  Kapaa is central and is convenient to the main city of Li'hue as well as a direct drive to the nostalgic North Shore where the infamous  Hanalei bay lies and the fabulous five star hotel, The St. Regis.

The Dwell-inspired home with it's vibrant, detailed nuances exhibits a pride of ownership and attention to detail that frankly, is uncommon for a property at this price point. There is much to appreciate here including a Home Theater with wet bar, a bonus / office space and remodeled bathrooms. Additional property features present are new paint, solar hot water heater, gas stove, cherry kitchen cabinets, split-zone A/C, skylights, a freestanding storage shed, fenced dog run and ample off-street parking.  You'll find the treasured outdoor living to be expansive and elegant - the spacious front lanai is decked in Ipe and surrounded by a colorful Bougainvillea hedge. The walled backyard oasis with a recently sodded lawn is shaded by a variegated Banyan tree and is accented by a whimsical fountain and gas fire pit.   5192 Apelila Street is a feature-rich destination where care and concern for form and function is abundantly evident. The current inventory is meager and sell-through rate vigorous - act soon, so as not to miss out on this distinct opportunity.
