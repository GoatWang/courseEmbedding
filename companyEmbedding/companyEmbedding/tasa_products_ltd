DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE
Form S-1, TASA Products Limited, Commission File No. 2-68566, but      excluding the balance sheet of TASA Products Limited together with      the report of independent certified public accountants, is      incorporated by reference in Items 1, 5, 11 and 13.

 
Item 1:  Description of Business
TASA PRODUCTS LIMITED (hereinafter call the  "Partnership"), is a Washington State  limited partnership organized as of June 19, 1980 for the purpose of  acquiring the rights in a group of related electronic products and  developing these products further to a point where they could be  commercially produced and marketed.  The  Partnership conducts   no other  business.  Michel E. Maes and James R.  Steffey  were  General Partners, through  Dec. 30, 2015.  Mr. Steffey resigned as  General Partner in Fedruary 2016. Mr. Maes is still a General Partner  and may remain as General  Partner  for the life of the Partnership unless  removed pursuant to the Partnership Agreement.   The sale of the Limited  Partnership Interests in the Partnership were made pursuant to  Registration Statement No. 2-68566 filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission and declared effective on November 7, 1980.  The purchasers of said  Limited Partnership Interests for Phases 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the  Partnership are the Limited Partners of the Partnership as of December 31,  1981.
The Partnership's business is more fully described under the caption      "Projects of the Partnership" in the Prospectus forming a part of the      Registration Statement described above (hereinafter called the      "Prospectus"), which, except for the balance sheet and report of      accountants contained herein, is incorporated herein by this reference      for all purposes. 
The Partnership has no employees.  The partnership originally licensed      the manufacture and sale of its products to Communications Research      Corporation, (CRC), a subsidiary of Energy Sciences Corporation, (ESC).      The Partnership subsequently has licensed LINC Technology Corporation, an      affiliate of the General Partners, as more fully described in Item 7      below.  TASA's principal products currently being sold by LINC are the      Data Over Voice Encoder, (DOVE), and Line Carrier Modem, (LCM). 
 Item 2:    Properties
The Partnership does not have any principal plants or physical      properties.

 Item 3:    Legal Proceedings
The staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of      Enforcement recommended to the Commission that it authorize the staff to      file a civil injunctive action against Energy Sciences Corporation,      Michel E. Maes, James R. Steffey, and the Partnership to require timely      filing of reports with the commission.  Such an injunction was entered on      June 25, 1986.  All subsequent reports have been timely filed.
On April 29, 1986, TASA Products Limited and Energy Sciences Corporation      filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy      Laws.  The Petitions were filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for      the Western District of Washington, at Seattle, as Case No.'s 86-02993-     Wll and 86-02994-Wll. 
Energy Sciences Corporation was dismissed from Chapter 11 on May 13,      1988.  ESC had financial dealings and intercompany transactions with the      partnership.  The assets of ESC, which included amounts owed by the      partnership to ESC and the license rights to manufacture and market the      partnership's products granted by the partnership to a subsidiary of ESC,      were foreclosed upon by the sole secured creditor of ESC, the law firm of      Murphy, Elgot & Moore, but the full effect on the partnership has not yet      been determined.  (See item 7 below). 
On October 16, 1989 the United States Bankruptcy Court ordered that the      partnership's Chapter 11 be converted to a Chapter 7.  Mr. Ronald Brown      of Leach, Brown & Andersen, Seattle Washington, was appointed trustee.       On May 11, 1990, the General Partners of the partnership filed an      amended motion to dismiss the Chapter 7.  This motion was granted and      the partnership is no longer in bankruptcy.
 Item 4:    Reserved
 Item 5:    Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant's Common                 Equity Related Security Holder Matters
(a)  There is no market for the Securities of the      Registrant.  The Registrant’s Partnership Units are  not traded and are     transferred only by inheritance at no cost.
3

 
(b)  There are 588 Limited partners as of December 31,      2015.    
(c)  The partnership does not pay dividends.  Royalties, based      on a percentage of gross sales of the partnership products, if any, made      by a licensee of the partnership's products are to be distributed to the      partners, less reserves and payments for partnership operating,      maintenance and reporting expenses as determined by the General Partners.       Under terms of the present license agreement in place, royalties were       owed on amounts collected by the licensee on sales made after September      1991 to be accrued and paid in the following accounting quarter starting      with the first quarter of 1992.  This arrangement was subsequently      modified as described in Item 7 below.
 Item 6:    Selected Financial Data

Item 7:    Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Financial                 Condition and Results of Operation
The partnership owns the proprietary rights to certain products      which are licensed to LINC Technology Corporation as described      more fully below.  The partnership conducts no operations itself      and its revenues will be solely from royalty income.

Under the      terms of a new license now in effect, total sales of $506,293      (cumulative over five years) were subject to royalties in 1999.  A      total royalty payment was made by Linc Technology Corporation to      four electronics partnerships that share ownership in certain      electronics products in the amount of $25,315 in December 1999.       In accordance with the sharing arrangement described below (third      paragraph down), a royalty of $12,118 was paid to the partnership      which is income for 1999.  Tax, Securities and Exchange      Commission, and Partnership Reporting expenses  were not charged      to the partnership in 1999  The partnership made a distribution of $10,906  total to      the limited partners in March 2000.  A total of $1,212 was paid to      two former secured creditors of the partnership in March 2000.  No      new royalties were paid in the years 2001 through 2015      and the partnership had no income nor loss for 2015. 
When ESC's bankruptcy was dismissed in May 1988, all remaining      assets were repossessed by the sole secured creditor of ESC,      Murphy, Elgot & Moore, represented by Mr. Thomas Murphy.  These      assets are primarily amounts owed to ESC by the partnerships and      the rights to produce electronics products at CRC.  The General      Partners began discussions with Mr. Murphy, (who was also counsel      for ESC and the partnerships), on plans to re-commercialize the      electronic products.  They were joined by Mr. Keith Nichols, who      had purchased a portion of the electronics inventory from CRC when      ESC was still in Chapter 11.  After conducting preliminary market      research and reaching a basic understanding with Mr. Murphy, a new      company was formed in September 1988, called LINC Technology      Corporation. The company was owned by Messrs. Maes, Steffey, and      Nichols in the amount of 19% each; Mr. Murphy owned 10% and the      balance of 33% was owned by outside investors. 
In 2001 a ownership restructuring took place with the unanimous      approval of all stockholders.  Mr. Maes and Mr. Steffey now own a      higher percentage of Linc Technology Corporation.
LINC was formed, and was initially privately financed with $49,000      of cash, plus donated time, to pursue a variety of opportunities      in electronics and data communications.  LINC believes that a      market remains for the partnership's products.  Continued emphasis      is on the LCM and the DOVE (now called the MDL500).

The Partnership made only one attempt to negotiate a license for      its products following the dissolution of Energy Sciences      Corporation and its subsidiary, Communications Research      Corporation (the initial licensee), in 1988.  A non-affiliated      company had been formed in 1987 called CRC, Inc., of which Mr.      Keith Nichols was a co-founder and partner.  (As described above,      Mr. Nichols was subsequently a co-founder of LINC Technology      Corporation in 1988, along with Mr. Steffey and Mr. Maes, general      partners of the partnership).  CRC, Inc. purchased inventory of      the partnership's products in 1987 from the Energy Sciences      Corporation Trustee.  Because there are no patents or trade      secrets covering any of the partnerships products, the owners of      CRC, Inc. felt no responsibility to pay royalties to the      partnership (and had no legal obligation to do so) when the issue      was discussed with them.  It was felt that this would be the case      with any outside third party the general partners might approach.       When Mr. Nichols expressed a desire to pursue the market more      aggressively than CRC, Inc. was doing, Mr. Steffey and Mr. Maes      proposed the formation of LINC Technology Corporation with the      understanding that LINC would pay royalties on partnership      products in the future.  LINC was formed and Mr. Nichols      subsequently sold the inventory of partnership products he owned      personally to LINC for ultimate resale to outside customers.  The      royalty arrangement arrived at between the partnership and LINC      was modeled after one negotiated with New Detonics Manufacturing      Corporation (NDMC) for a group of affiliated partnerships, as part      of the sale of assets of another Energy Sciences Corporation      subsidiary, Detonics Manufacturing Corporation to NDMC.  That      royalty arrangement called for 4% royalties and a four year      deferment. 
The license entered into between the partnerships and LINC calls      for a royalty building to 5% of gross sales to be paid to each      partnership on sales, if any, of its own products (compared to the      prior formula with CRC which ranged from 10% down to 6%).       Royalties are paid on amounts actually collected by LINC from      sales of partnership products and calculated and accrued in the      following quarterly accounting period.

The details of the royalty      arrangement are as follows: Initial royalties of 1% are payable on      collected invoices for sales starting in September 1990, followed      by 2% in September 1991 and 5% per year starting in September 1992      and thereafter.  The royalty is  divided between partnerships in      the case of joint ownership of product rights.  TASA receives 45%      of the 5% royalty from sales of DOVE (MDL500) and 90% of the 5%      from sales of LCM.  In 1995, a new royalty agreement was put into      effect in order to reduce administrative expenses.  Under the new      plan, no royalties will accrue to the partnership until a total of      $300,000.00 of sales on products licensed to LINC Technology      Corporation have been generated and collected.  At that point, a      lump sum royalty payment of $15,000.00 will be paid to the      partnership group of TASA Products Limited (the Partnership),      Energy Sciences Limited Partnership, Telemetric Controls Limited      Partnership, and Communications Link Limited Partnership.  After      such payment, again no royalty will accrue or be owed until      another $300,000.00 in sales has occurred, after which a second      lump sum of $15,000.00 is due, and so forth.   LINC Technology      Corporation will be responsible for periodic mailings to the      partnership at its expense.  Based on IRS regulations, no      partnership 1065 tax returns and K-1s have to be filed or issued      until the royalty is paid.  Filings of 1065 and K-1 forms were      done in March 2000 for year 1999.  Filings of 1065 and K-1 forms      were done again in March 2001 for year 2000 for information      purposes to show the changes in capital accounts.  No 1065 and K-1      filings were required or done in 2015.
 As described above, in 1995, the General Partners put in place an      arrangement under which royalties would not be payable to the      partnerships and profit would not accrue until a total of $300,000      in sales had occurred.  In 2003, as the amount of sales was      approaching $300,000 again, the General Partners reviewed the      costs associated with preparing the partnership tax returns (Form      1065) and the preparation and mailing of both the K-1s and      distribution checks.  Based on the experience in 2000, the      General Partners estimated the cost to be approximately $5000.00.       In addition, the General Partners heard from many Limited Partners      that the trouble involved in providing the tax information to      their accountants was not worth the money that they received. 
7

 
The      General Partners therefore increased the level of sales required      before a royalty payment is due from $300,000 to $600,000, which      would result in a royalty payment totaling $30,000, instead of      $15,000 to be divided among all individual limited partners.  As a      result, a smaller percentage of the royalty would go to tax form      and check preparation costs. Accounting information in early 2008      indicated that the $600,000 point had been reached so Linc      Technology would pay out the appropriate amount near the end of      2008 and send checks and IRS k-1 forms in early 2009. However, the     world-wide recession had a severe impact on Linc Technology starting      in mid 2008 and has involved layoffs and salary cuts. That remained the       case through 2015. As a result in     the decline of business, Linc Technology was not able to make the      royalty payment so no distribution was made to the Limited Partners      and no IRS K-1s were issued.  It is now hoped that the royalty payment      can be made in late 2016, but there can be no assurance of that. 
LINC Technology Corporation's new address is in Issaquah, WA  98027 ;   their telephone number remains 425-882-2206.  LINC Technology      Corporation uses the DBA of DATA-LINC Group. 
As previously reported, one remaining item from the dismissal of      Energy Sciences Corporation's bankruptcy is the residual amount      initially owed to ESC by the partnership, and then to the law firm      of Murphy & Elgot.  Mr. Murphy has passed away and the debt is now      owed to his former partner, Mr. Elgot.  No specific payment      schedule or percentage of the partnership's overall royalty cash      flow has been established to settle the debt.  Mr. Elgot has     occasionally done legal work for LINC Technology Corporation. 
The partnership's ultimate success is dependant on LINC's ability      to generate sales and to obtain capital, which can not be      continually assured.  Sales on products licensed from the      partnership were $200,969 in 1999, $107,768 in 1998, $90,377 in      1997, $47,000 in 1996 and $60,000 in 1995.  This resulted in the      royalty distribution early 2000.
In 2015, a total of $11,261 of the partnerships’ products were sold by LINC Technology Corporation. This compares with $24,711 in 2012, $18,937 in 2011, $23,521 in 2010, $27,145 in 2009, $20,444 in 2008, $78,644 in 2007, $93,189 in 2006 $68,638 in 2005, $62,363 in 2004, $89,475 in 2003, $60,965 for 2002, $111,551 for 2001 and $64,502 for 2000. The cumulative total is now $723,641.

Such sales represent only a small portion of the sales for LINC      Technology Corporation, which now manufactures and sells a broad      range of industrial modems, with emphasis on wireless modems. 
Since 1991, new product development work was been undertaken  at  Linc and other  affiliates, including independent R&D efforts by  the general  partners personally, which created some products that  interface with and  complement the products owned by the  partnership and  could enhance sales of the partnership's products  in the future.  Sales of partnership products for calendar  2016  can not be  predicted but are expected to remain modest.   LINC has  experienced some  reduction in business from 2002 through  2015  due to increased  competition but expects some improvement in  2016.  LINC   has modest working capital and does not do  significant  advertising.  LINC relies on Distributors  to generate  most of its sales  leads.  Production is self funded through  inventory turnover.  LINC's major marketing focus remains on  industrial data  communications.

Item 9A Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial      Reporting and Procedures
9

 
Management of the Partnership is responsible for preparing the      Partnership's annual financial statements. Management is also      responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over     financial reporting.
 The Partnership's internal control contains monitoring mechanisms,     and actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified.  There are     inherent limitations to any internal control, including the      possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of      controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control can provide     only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement      preparation..  Further, because of changes in conditions,      effectiveness of internal control can vary over time. 
 The Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures are designed      to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports      that are filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of      1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported      within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the      Securities and Exchange Commission.  Disclosure controls and      procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures      designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an      issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is      accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management including      its principal executive and principal financial officers, or      persons performing similar functions (the General Partners), as      appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required      disclosure. 
The Partnership's management assessed the effectiveness of the      Partnership's disclosure controls and procedures as of      December 31, 2015 the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K report and concluded that they were effective.
 In making this assessment, it used criteria set forth by the      Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)     in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment,     we believe that, as of December 31, 2015, the Partnership's internal    control     over financial reporting was effective.

This annual report does not include an attestation report by the      Partnership's registered public accounting firm regarding internal      control over financial reporting.  Management's report was not subject     to attestation by the Partnership's registered public accounting firm      pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission     that permit the Partnership to provide only management's report in      this annual report.

Mr. Steffey is now      President of LINC Technology Corporation.  Mr. Steffey was not      closely involved with the technical aspects of the      Partnership's activities.
Mr. Steffey resigned as General Partner on   February 20, 2016 and Mr. Maes is now the sole General Partner of TASA Product Limited.
 Item 11:   Executive Compensation
The Partnership has no directors, officers or employees and thus      pays no direct compensation.  The General Partners were paid a      one-time management fee in 1982.  The General Partners and their      affiliates received certain compensation as described in the table      "Compensation and Fees to General Partners and Affiliates" in the      Prospectus which is hereby incorporated by reference.  The General Partners are paid no bonuses and but are reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses, not including labor, when and if funds are available.
 Item 12:   Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and                 Management
(a)  The only outstanding voting securities of the      Limited Partnerships are those Limited Partnership interests owned      by the investors or their successors in interest.  No single      person owns 5% or more. 
(b)  The General Partners hold no limited partnership      interests.  However, they have interests in Profits and Losses and      Cash Available for Distribution of 5%.  The interest in Cash      Available for Distribution is subordinated to the Limited      Partners' receipt of distributions equal to their capital      contributions. 
12

 
(c)  There are no agreements or arrangements known      which could affect control of TASA. 
 Item 13:   Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
As described in the prospectus, TASA was a party to several      contracts with affiliates of the Limited Partners which resulted      in compensation to the General Partners.  See "Compensation and      Fees to the General Partners and Affiliates" and "Certain      Transactions" in the Prospectus, which hereby is incorporated      herein by reference.

TASA PRODUCTS LIMITED 
  (a Washington State limited partnership)
  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 1.  Partnership Organization and Operations
TASA Products Limited, a Washington State limited partnership      ("the partnership"), was formed on June 19, 1980 for the purpose      of raising certain capital through the public offering of Limited      Partnership interests (4,100 units; $1,000 per unit), and      acquiring the rights to and conducting research and development      with respect to a group of electronic products.  Subsequently, the      Partnership commenced limited manufacturing and marketing      activities for certain products.  The Partnership has two general      partners and limited partners comprised of certain investor groups. 
  Research and development was completed and sales of products      began.  For admission to the Partnership, an investor was assigned      to a group (one group is associated with each phase), based on the      timing of receipt of the contribution.  Sale of all of the 4,100      limited partnership units was completed in 1981. The units of the      Partnership are non-assessable. 
 Partners' Capital
 Initial contributions aggregating $4,100,00 were made by the      Limited Partners.  The General Partners have not and will not make      any capital contributions.  Partners share in income or loss of      the partnership as set forth below. 
 Allocation of Income, Loss and Cash Distributions
The loss attributable to the research and development efforts of      each phase was allocated to the partners included in such phase as      follows: 

 
Limited Partners, pro rata                 98% 
General Partners                            2%

19

 
All income and/or loss attributable to the operations after the      research and development program has been completed, including      revenues derived from the sale or other disposition of any rights      or interest, shall be allocated as follows: 


 
Limited Partners, all groups, pro rata
98%


 
General Partners
2%


The Limited Partners shall receive one hundred percent of the cash      available for distribution, until such time as the Limited      Partners have received in distribution an amount equal to the      cumulative capital contributions received from Limited Partners. 
After the Limited Partners have received cash distributions in an      amount equal to the cumulative capital contributions received from      Limited Partners, the General Partners will receive one hundred      percent of the cash available for distribution, until such time as      the General Partners have received an amount equal to five percent      of the cumulative capital contributions received from Limited      Partners. 
 Thereafter, the cash available for distribution shall be allocated      as follows: 


 
Limited Partners, all groups, pro rata
95%


 
General Partners
5%


 Upon dissolution of the Partnership, proceeds of the liquidation      will be applied in accordance with the terms of the Amended      Certificate and Agreement of Limited Partnership in the following      order of priority: 


 
1) 
To the payment of liabilities of the Partnership and               expenses of liquidation; 


 
 
 


 
2) 
 To the setting up on any reserves which the General               Partners may deem reasonably necessary for any contingent              or unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the               Partnership, or of the General Partners, arising out of or              in connection with the Partnership;


20

 


 
3) 
To the repayment of the Limited Partners' contributions to              the capital of the Partnership, plus an amount equal to               six percent of the capital contributions per annum               cumulative, less the sum of prior distributions to               investors from cash available for distribution;


 
 
 


 
4) 
Any balance then remaining shall be apportioned among all              the partners as follows:




 
 
 
 
 


 
 
 
Limited Partners, pro rata 
98%


 
 
 
General Partners
2%


Pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the General      Partners are not required to contribute to the Partnership any      deficit in their capital accounts which exist after application of      proceeds of liquidation as set forth above.
The Partnership filed for Bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11      in April 1986.  The Chapter 11 was converted to a Chapter 7 by the      Bankruptcy Court in October 1989 and then the Bankruptcy was      dismissed in June 1990. The dismissal did not involve any      discharge of the Partnership's obligations, some of which were      accrued property taxes in the amount of under $1,000.  These were      paid by the General Partners and are now included in the Amounts      Payable To Affiliates. 
 2.  Significant Accounting Policies
 Basis of Reporting
The records of the Partnership are maintained using the cash      basis of accounting.  A substantial portion of the transactions      of the Limited Partnership have been, and will continue to be,      with the entities affiliated with the General Partners. 
 Inventories
The partnership has no inventories.
21

 
Property and Equipment
 The partnership has no tangible properties.
 Other Assets
 The partnership has no tangible assets.
 Offering Costs
Offering costs, including sale commissions to brokers for sales of      limited partnership interests were charged directly to the      respective partners' capital account. 
 Income Taxes
The Partnership is not a tax-paying entity.  No provision is made      in these financial statements for federal and state income taxes. 
 Research and Development Expenses
 Research and development costs paid or accrued under terms of a      contract with an affiliated company were charged to expense in the      period in which the obligation was incurred. 
 Net Loss Attributable to Limited Partners Units
The net loss attributable to each $1,000 limited partnership unit      represents the loss for the period allocated to limited partners      divided by the number of partnership units outstanding at the end      of the period.  The net loss allocated to specific individual      units will vary from the amount shown depending on the group to      which a limited partner has been assigned. 
 3.  Notes and Accrued Interest Payable to an Affiliated Company
At December 31, 1980, the Partnership executed a promissory note      under the terms of a research and development contract. The note      in the amount of $1,148,000 bears interest at the rate of eight      and one-half percent compounded annually. 
22

 
Upon completion of the      Partnership funding in 1981, an additional note of $252,000 with      the same terms was executed.  The principal and accrued interest      was to be paid in full no later than December 31, 1986, and are      collateralized by a pledge of certain rights to inventions held by      the Partnership.  The date for repayment could be extended at the      request of the Partnership to December 31, 1993, provided the      Partnership has made payments toward the principal and the accrued      interest by December 31, 1986.  After December 31, 1990, interest      shall be at a rate of ten percent compounded annually.  Failure of      the Partnership to complete payment in full of the entire contract      price plus interest on or before December 31, 1986 or such other      date if the payment period is extended gives the affiliate the      right to foreclose the pledge of the Partnership's ownership      interest in the rights to inventions referred to above.  In the      event the Partnership assigns, licenses or sells its rights to the      inventions to any other party, the affiliate retains an interest      in any royalties or income from such assignment, license or sale      until such time as the note is paid in full. 
Due to the filing of Chapter 11 by the Partnership's affiliate,      and by the Partnership, and due to the cessation of commercial      activity relating to the Partnership's products, all accrual of      interest and right of foreclosure was suspended for the years      beyond 1987. The Chapter 11 proceeding of the Partnership's      affiliate was dismissed on May 13, 1988.  As of February 2005, no      final settlement had been reached with the former secured      creditors of the Partnership's affiliate regarding the debt owed      by the Partnership.  No further interest was accrued after 1986 by      agreement with the secured creditor. 
 4.  Transactions with Related Parties
 A substantial portion of the transactions of the Partnership have      been, and are anticipated in the future to be, with the General      Partners and their affiliates.  Significant transactions with      these parties are summarized in the following paragraph. 
Management fees to the General Partners of $18,500 and $84,000      (2.5% of the limited partners' contributions), were incurred in      1981 and 1980, respectively. 
23

 
The fees represent compensation to      the General Partners for organization of the Partnership and for      expense incurred in connection with the offering of the limited      partnership units.  The fees were allocated to organization and      offering costs. 
An affiliate of the General Partners entered into a fixed price      research and development contract with the Partnership.  The      affiliate received $756,000 (cash of $504,00 and a promissory note      in the amount of $252,000), and $3,444,000 (cash of $2,296,000 and      a promissory note in the amount of $1,148,000), in 1981 and 1980,      respectively, as payment for conducting all present and future      research and development of the Partnership.  The affiliate's      costs for performing the research and development activities      included certain general and administrative and overhead costs      allocated by its parent company, an affiliate of the General      Partners. 
 Prior to transferring product rights under the licensing      agreement, the Partnership can manufacture and market any products      developed.  In 1982, the Partnership elected to do so and entered      into a manufacturing and marketing agreement whereby the      Partnership reimbursed the affiliate for all costs incurred in the      manufacturing and marketing activities.  In addition, the      affiliate would receive 40% of net profits (as defined in the      agreement), derived from the manufacture and sale of the products      produced under this agreement.  Substantially all operating costs      of this affiliate have been allocated to the Partnership under      this agreement. 
The Partnership has been charged for certain general and      administrative services provided by other affiliates of the      General Partners.  The General Partners have and will provide      management, research and development and other technical services      to affiliates which provide services to the Partnership.  The      General Partners are and will be compensated by the affiliated      companies for such services. 
A new license agreement has been entered into by the Partnership      with a newly created entity, which, as with the prior license, the      General Partners are part owners, officers and directors.  The      General Partners have received and are expected to receive      compensation in the future from this entity. 
24

 
5.  Commitments and Contingencies
The Partnership entered into agreements with several      individuals to obtain title to inventions and designs relating to      the electronic products the Partnership is developing.  Pursuant      to the terms of the agreements, the individuals are entitled to      royalties received by the Partnership under licensing agreements      associated with the products. 
 The Partnership entered into a licensing agreement with an      affiliate of the General Partners providing manufacturing and      marketing services under which the licensee has, upon transfer of      the product rights, the exclusive right to manufacture, use and      sell any products successfully developed by the Partnership.  The      terms of the agreement extend throughout the life of the      Partnership.  In return for granting this license, the Partnership      shall receive royalties from the licensee as set forth in the      licensing agreement for its own products.  The details of the      royalty arrangement are as follows: Initial royalties of 1% are      payable on collected invoices for sales starting in September      1990, followed by 2% in September 1991 and 5% per year starting in      September 1992 and thereafter.  (Accounting is done in the quarter      following the quarter in which the sales receipts occur).  The      royalty is divided between partnerships in the case of joint      ownership of rights.  TASA receives 45% of the 5% royalty from      sales of DOVE and 90% of the 5% from sales of LCM. 
In 1995, a new royalty agreement was put into effect in order to      reduce administrative expenses.  Under the new plan, no royalties      will accrue to the partnership until a total of $300,000.00 of      sales on products licensed to LINC Technology Corporation have      been generated and collected.  At that point, a lump sum royalty      payment of $15,000.00 will be paid to the partnership group of      TASA Products Limited (the Partnership), Energy Sciences Limited      Partnership, Telemetric Controls Limited Partnership, and      Communications Link Limited Partnership.  After such payment,      again no royalty will accrue or be owed until another $300,000.00      in sales has occurred, after which a second lump sum of $15,000.00      is due, and so forth.   LINC Technology Corporation will be      responsible for periodic mailings to the partnership at its      expense.  Based on IRS regulations, no partnership 1065 tax      returns and K-1s have to be filed or issued until the royalty      accrues.  Filings of 1065 and K-1 forms were done in March 2000      for year 1999.  Filings of 1065 and K-1 forms were done again in      March 2001 for year 2000 for information purposes to show the      changes in capital accounts.
25

 
 In 2003, as the amount of sales was approaching $300,000 again,      the General Partners reviewed the costs associated with preparing      the partnership tax returns (Form 1065) and the preparation and      mailing of both the K-1s and distribution checks.  Based on our      experience in 2000, the General Partners estimated the cost to be      approximately $5000.00.  In addition, the General Partners heard      from many Limited Partners that the trouble involved in providing      the tax information to their accountants was not worth the money      that they received.  The General Partners therefore increased the      level of sales required before a royalty payment is due from      $300,000 to $600,000, which would result in a royalty payment      totaling $30,000, instead of $15,000 to be divided among all      individual limited partners.  As a result, a smaller percentage of      the royalty would go to tax form and check preparation costs.

A brief understanding of the process of ‘Purees’ and ‘Concentrates’

Fruit puree and concentrates are the versatile products of availability in the market. The adequate processing and packing enables the manufacture along the whole year, regardless of the seasons.

When the fruits are picked from the fields it is washed, separating out stems and leaves, and then graded. Machines extract seeds and pulp, then strain and puree the fruit. The puree then receives a "quick heat" treatment, or pasteurization to deactivate organic enzymes, preserving flavor, color, and texture offering a 24 month shelf life. The puree is then cooled & packed. Thus, puree is made from fruit that has been pulped and mashed.
 
The Concentrate process starts with the washing of fruits, leaf cleaning, boning, enzyme deactivation and aseptic processing. From this first processing phase the result is a paste that passes on to the evaporation process where water is reduced from the paste. A pasteurization process normally follows and then aseptic packaging. Fruit concentrates come from fruit juice that has had the water removed during processing. Concentrates are thicker in consistency than purees also typically higher in sugars. Depending on the flavor, a concentrate can be 200 – 250% stronger in flavor than its puree equivalency.

The
partnership originally licensed the manufacturing and sale of its
products to Communications Research Corporation, (CRC) a subsidiary
of Energy Sciences Corporation, (ESC). ESC and the Partnership
entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings on April 29, 1986. On May
13, 1988, ESC's bankruptcy was dismissed and all remaining assets,
primarily amounts owed to ESC, including amounts owed by the
partnership, and the rights to produce electronic products at CRC,
were repossessed by the sole secured creditor of ESC, Mr. Thomas
Murphy. A new company was formed in September 1988, called LINC
Technology Corporation. The company ownership was restructured in
2005 and is now owned by Messrs. Maes and Steffey in the amount of
41% each; the balance of 18% ownership is held by Mr. Murphy's
heirs, Mr. Nichols, a founder, and by outside investors. Mr.
Nichols resigned from LINC in August 1991, but remains a
stockholder. LINC has been initially privately financed with
$49,000 of cash to pursue a variety of opportunities in data
communications. LINC believes that a market remains for some of the
partnerships' products. Emphasis is on LCM and DOVE. A license has
been entered into between the partnership and LINC, similar in
terms to that which existed with CRC, with the exception that in
return for elimination of most of the debt owed by the partnerships
to ESC (and now, therefore, Mr.Murphy's heirs) and in recognition
of the need to attract more capital for LINC, the royalty to be
paid the partnership is set at 5% of gross sales, (compared to the
prior formula, ranging from 10% down to 6%). The new royalty is
divided between the partnership and four other partnerships in the
case of joint ownership of rights, such as the case with DOVE, for
example. All royalties were deferred for three years from September
1988 in order to allow LINC to build its working
capital.

In 1995,
a new royalty agreement was put into effect in order to reduce
administrative expenses. Under the new plan, no royalties will
accrue to the partnership until a total of $300,000.00 of sales on
products licensed to LINC Technology Corporation have been
generated and collected. At that point, a lump sum royalty payment
of $15,000.00 will be paid to the partnership group of TASA
Products Limited (the Partnership), Energy Sciences Limited
Partnership, Telemetric Controls Limited Partnership, and
Communications Link Limited Partnership. After such payment, again
no royalty will accrue or be owed until another $300,000.00 in
sales has occured, after which a second lump sum of $15,000.00 is
due, and so forth. LINC Technology Corporation will be responsible
for periodic mailings to the partnership at its expense. Based on
IRS regulations, no partnership 1065 tax returns and K-1s will have
to be filed or issued until the royalty is paid. Royalties of
$12,118 were paid to the Partnership in December 1999 and a total
disbursement of $10,906 was made to the limited partners in
February 2000. $1,212 was paid to historical creditors of the
partnership. The general partners did not receive any payments from
the partnership.

In 2003,
as the amount of sales was approaching $300,000 again, the General
Partners reviewed the costs associated with preparing the
partnership tax returns (Form 1065) and the preparation and mailing
of both the K-1s and distribution checks. Based on our experience
in 2000, the General Partners estimated the cost to be
approximately $5000.00. In addition, the General Partners heard
from many Limited Partners that the trouble involved in providing
the tax information to their accountants was not worth the money
that they received. The General Partners therefore increased the
level of sales required before a royalty payment is due from
$300,000 to $600,000, which would result in a royalty payment
totaling $30,000 instead of $15,000 to be divided among all
individual limited partners, the amount will be $30,000. As a
result, a smaller percentage of the royalty would go to tax form,
check preparation, mailing costs. As a result of this new
arrangement, no royalties were paid in this fiscal
period.

LINC
Technology had planned to make a distribution to the partnerships
in late 2008. The effects of the current recession have thus far
prevented that from happening. It is hoped that the payment and
distribution can take place in late 2011.

Only a
small portion of LINC Technology Corporation's sales were for
products which the Partnership licenses to LINC Technology
Corporation. Accounting of the amount of sales on products subject
to partnership royalty will not be done until the end of the
calender year.

LINC
Technology Corporation's address is 3535 Factoria Blvd. S.E.,
Bellevue, WA 98006 and telephone 425-882-2206. Modest sales of the
partnership's products continue to be made but are still irregular
quarter to quarter. The company concentrates on
