(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following information should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, together with the more detailed business information and the March 31, 2013 audited financial statements included in the Company's Registration Statement filed on Form S-1 Amendment No. 2 (File No. 333-188610), as filed with the SEC on July 23, 2013. It also includes our detailed expenditures and milestones for our plan of operations described herein. Statements in this section and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q that are not statements of historical or current fact constitute "forward-looking" statements.  GENERAL OVERVIEW  Our Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 25, 2013 to engage in the development and sale of electronic medical record ("EMR") software for small and medium sized physician offices and clinics. Our principal executive offices are located at Mlynska 28, 040 01 Kosice, Slovak Republic. Our phone number is (646) 875-5747. We are a development stage company, we only just completed our first fiscal year end on March 31 and we have no subsidiaries.  We are in the early stages of developing our EMR software. We currently have no revenues, no operating history, and no users or revenues for our proposed software. Our plan of operations over the 12 month period following successful completion of our offering is to gain support for our concept and create fully functional EMR software. This product, when completed, will be commercially viable and available for commercial sale. Initially, the EMR software is planned to be a software tool that will collect and capture patient data electronically, and store it in a format that enables efficient access and viewing, and distribution by printing or email. Our planned second phase product development will focus on interconnectivity of our EMR software with various third party vital signs monitors, such as blood pressure monitors or temperature monitors.  We are in the initial stages of attempting to raise up to $50,000 in common share equity to proceed with our EMR first phase product development. In order to do so, we filed a Registration Statement with the SEC to conduct our initial public offering. Our Registration Statement was declared effective on August 12, 2013. As of the date hereof we have not raised any equity, and we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise and we are at least 18-24 months away (from the date hereof) from generating any revenue, if at all. We believe that the funds from this offering will allow us to operate for one year, only if we are successful in raising the maximum permitted under the offering.  Our current planned offering is also only sufficient to complete development of the basic EMR software, provided we raise the maximum. We currently estimate that we will require an additional $200,000 for the commercial launch of our basic EMR software and subsequent to the completion of the basic EMR software, another 8-10 months and $50,000 to develop the software development kit for interoperability with third parties.  From inception until the date of this filing we have had limited operating activities, primarily consisting of the incorporation of our company and the initial equity funding by our officer and director. We received our initial funding of $15,000 through the sale of common stock to our officer and director, who purchased 5,000,000 shares at $0.003 per share.  GOING CONCERN  We have very limited operations and no revenues. We have incurred losses from operations since inception. No revenues are anticipated until we complete and successfully commercialize our planned EMR software. The ability of our Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising capital to fund our business plan and ultimately to attain profitable operations. Accordingly, these factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Our activities to date have been financed from the proceeds of share subscriptions. From our inception to June 30, 2013 we have raised a total of $15,000 in gross proceeds from the issuance of our common stock. We require significant additional financing to develop our business. There is no guarantee that we will be able to raise any additional funds.  PLAN OF OPERATION  Our plan of operations over the 12 month period following successful completion of our offering is to create fully functional and compliant EMR software. This product will be commercially viable, and available for purchase when completed. Initially, the EMR system is planned to be a software tool that will collect and capture patient data in electronic format. We are also planning to provide file output in PDF format, so it can be emailed by the user.  The patient features that our EMR will include in this first phase are:  Patient Profile: First & Last Name, Contacts (street / city / zip code / country / phone / email)  All parameters will be PDF format enabled for printing and email, and will have a designated output directory associated with them for efficient clinical access and viewing. We are also planning to design all data fields with a text-based editor to allow for physician and any other user notes to be easily entered and captured on the patient file. In order to achieve our plan, we have established the following goals for this initial 12 month period:  * Create product overview and slide deck for investors  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  From the inception of our company on February 25, 2013 to March 31, 2013 (our first fiscal year end) we incurred a loss of $555, all of which was incurred for the incorporation of our company.  We incurred a loss of $6,535 for the three months ended June 30, 2013. Comparisons are not meaningful because our company was only just incorporated on February 25, 2013. This loss includes $535 for general and administrative costs and $6,000 for professional fees for our 2013 audit and legal fees associated with our S-1 Registration Statement for our initial public offering.  From inception on February 25, 2013 to June 30, 2013 we have incurred cumulative losses of $7,090. We believe we will continue to incur losses into the foreseeable future as we develop our business.  REVENUES  We did not generate any revenues from February 25, 2013 (inception) to June 30, 2013. We will not be in a position to generate revenues for at least 18-24 months from the date hereof. Future revenue generation is dependent on the successful development and commercial launch of our EMR software. We currently estimate that we will require an additional financing of $200,000 to launch our product.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Historically, we have financed our cash flow and operations solely from the sale of $15,000 of common stock to our director. Of the $15,000 we raised, $7,028 was used for operating activities since our inception on February 25, 2013. As of June 30, 2013, our resultant cash balance was $7,972 and our net working capital balance was $7,910.  As of the date hereof, our net working capital balance is $7,295. We believe our current cash and net working capital balance is only sufficient to cover our expenses for the next 4-6 months. If we cannot raise any additional financing prior to the expiry of this timeframe, we will be forced to cease operations and our business will fail.  Even under a limited operations scenario to maintain our corporate existence, we believe we will require a minimum of $11,000 in additional cash over the next 12 months to pay for the remainder of our total offering costs, and to maintain our regulatory reporting and filings. Other than our planned offering, we currently have no arrangement in place to cover this shortfall.  In order to achieve our stated business plan goals, we require the funding from this offering. We are a development stage company and have generated no revenue to date. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to sell all the shares required. Even if we are successful in raising all of the funding under this offering, we will still not be in a position to generate any significant revenues or become profitable. We still must raise significant additional funding to continue with our business. Our planned offering is only sufficient to enable us to develop our basic EMR software. We believe we will require an additional $200,000 for marketing expenses for the commercial launch of our basic EMR software and another 8-10 months and $50,000 to develop the software development kit for interoperability with third party monitoring equipment manufacturers.  These funds will have to be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership of our shares. We will also need more funds if the costs of commercialization and further development are greater than we have budgeted. We will also require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are ultimately not successful in earning revenues. We currently do not have any arrangements in place regarding our current offering or any subsequent offering for further financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when required. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.  There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. Even if additional financing is available, it may not be available on terms we find favorable. At this time, there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place. Failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business.  Aug 15, 2013  (c) 1995-2013 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

 Zlato, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ZFLO) Files An 8-K Changes in Control of Registrant

Item 5.01 Changes in Control of Registrant


On February 21, 2017, Dana Gallovicova agreed to transfer her
5,000,000 shares of common stock in the Company to Gert Andersen
to a Stock Purchase Agreement. Ms. Gallovicova received proceeds
of $100,000. The source of the consideration paid to Ms.
Gallovicova was the existing funds of the purchaser.


Ms. Gallovicova also assigned all of the outstanding debt owed to
her by the Company to Mr. Andersen for $32,608. In connection
with the debt assignment, Ms. Gallovicova agreed to release the
Company from any and all claims.


In connection with the sale of her controlling interest in the
company, on February 24, 2017, Ms. Gallovicova appointed Mr.
Andersen as our new Director, President, CEO, Secretary and
Treasurer and then resigned from all officer and director
positions, as discussed in Item 5.02, below. There were no other
arrangements or understandings between Ms. Gallovicova and Mr.
Andersen with respect to election of directors or other matters.


There are no arrangements known to the company, the operation of
which may, at a subsequent date, result in a change in control of
the registrant.


Following the change in control, and the officer and director
resignation and appointments described in Item 5.02, below, the
following table sets forth certain information known to us with
respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of
February 21, 2017 by (1) all persons who are beneficial owners of
5% or more of our voting securities, (2) each director, (3) each
executive officer, and (4) all directors and executive officers
as a group. The information regarding beneficial ownership of our
common stock has been presented in accordance with the rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under these rules, a
person may be deemed to beneficially own any shares of capital
stock as to which such person, directly or indirectly, has or
shares voting power or investment power, and to beneficially own
any shares of our capital stock as to which such person has the
right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days
through the exercise of any stock option or other right. The
percentage of beneficial ownership as to any person as of a
particular date is calculated by dividing (a) (i) the number of
shares beneficially owned by such person plus (ii) the number of
shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or
investment power within 60 days by (b) the total number of shares
outstanding as of such date, plus any shares that such person has
the right to acquire from us within 60 days. Including those
shares in the tables does not, however, constitute an admission
that the named stockholder is a direct or indirect beneficial
owner of those shares. Unless otherwise indicated, each person or
entity named in the table has sole voting power and investment
power (or shares that power with that persons spouse) with
respect to all shares of capital stock listed as owned by that
person or entity.


Except as otherwise indicated, all Shares are owned directly and
the percentage shown is based on 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding.

    plans in place to cover the shortfall.

Our offering expenses of approximately  $10,500 are comprised primarily of legal
and accounting  expenses,  Securities and Exchange  Commission ("SEC") and EDGAR
filing fees and transfer  agent fees.  Our officer and director will not receive
any compensation for their efforts in selling our shares.

If we are  not  able  to sell  750,000  shares  we can  maintain  our  reporting
requirements with the SEC and complete our research of compliance and regulatory
issues but we will not be able to develop our basic EMR software.  If we are not
able to sell a minimum of 500,000  shares of our common stock in this  Offering,
we can develop our website and maintain our reporting with the SEC and remain in
good  standing  with the  state of  Nevada.  If we do not sell at least  250,000
shares of our common stock we will not be able to maintain our reporting  status
with the SEC and  remain  in good  standing  with the  state of  Nevada  without
additional funds.

We currently do not have any  arrangements  regarding this Offering or following
this Offering for further  financing and we may not be able to obtain  financing
when  required.  Our future is  dependent  upon our  ability  to obtain  further
financing,  the successful development of our planned EMR software, a successful
marketing and promotion program, and achieving a profitable level of operations.
The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant
dilution  in  the  equity  interests  of  our  current  stockholders.  Obtaining
commercial  loans,  assuming  those loans would be available,  will increase our
liabilities and future cash commitments. There are no assurances that we will be
able to obtain  further  funds  required for our continued  operations.  Even if
additional  financing  is  available,  it may not be  available on terms we find
favorable. At this time, there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in
place.  Failure to secure the needed  additional  financing will have an adverse
effect on our ability to remain in business.

If we are successful in selling all 1,000,000 common shares under this Offering,
the net proceeds will be used for our business plan and general working capital,
during the twelve months  following the successful  completion of this Offering.
In all instances, after the effectiveness of the registration statement of which
this  prospectus  is a part,  we will require some amount of working  capital to
maintain our basic operations and comply with our public reporting  obligations.
In addition to changing our allocation of cash because of the amount of proceeds
received,  we may change the use of proceeds  because of changes in our business
plan. Investors should  understand that we have wide discretion over the use of
proceeds.


We do not yet have a commercial  product available for sale. When complete,  our
EMR software will be competing in the  healthcare  industry for primarily  small
and medium sized  physician  offices and clinics.  The U.S. EMR software  market
currently  has many  competitors.  We believe that  Allscripts  is currently the
market leader.  Our competitors  vary in size and cost structure from very small
companies with limited  resources to very large,  diversified  corporations with
greater  financial and marketing  resources  than ours.  We are  considered  the
smallest as we do not currently have a commercial product yet available for sale
or use. We will be competing with well funded start-ups, traditional independent
software  developers and  manufacturers,  and fully integrated large private and
publicly held companies producing a wide range of products and services. We will
likely face  additional  competition  from the entry of new  companies  into our
target market.

Our competitors have significantly  greater resources and are able to spend more
time and money on concept and focus testing,  software and product  development,
testing and marketing.  Lead times are  significant for the adoption and regular
use of EMR  software  by any given  small to medium  sized  physician  office or
clinic. Conversions  of  paper  records  to  EMR  databases   usually  involve
customization and significant time to train personnel and convert paper records.
Competition  is also  based on  product  quality  and  features,  data  storage,
brand-name  recognition,  ease of use,  effectiveness of marketing and price. In
order to compete effectively, we believe we must offer:

- Competitive pricing
- 24 hour user support
- 99.999% guaranteed uptime for hosted solutions
- Rapid development of new features
- Incentives and bonuses to clients who refer new customers
- Dedicated sales and support staff
- Work directly with users to develop features according to their needs
- Work  directly  with all the major device  manufacturers  to integrate their 
  devices seamlessly into our system

In addition, regardless of our competitor's market position, financial resources
or size, our success also depends on our ability to successfully execute several
other competitive  strategies,  which we believe must  successfully  address the
following for our customers:

. Increase office productivity and clinical workflow: We must design and build 
  our EMR software specifically to reduce office transition time and resources 
  to convert the existing paper records, in addition to ongoing daily data 
  record keeping. We plan on developing software that will enable simple 
  conversion of paper based formats to electronic formats through the use of 
  simple readily available paper scanners which can convert the paper file into
  digital and PDF format. We consider this a key feature, as the PDF can be 
  easily saved to the computer database, reducing staff time. 

. Connectivity and integrated automation of patient vital signs: 

Ultimately, our EMR software must have the ability to record patient vital 
signs directly from a given monitoring device, such as a blood pressure monitor,
seamlessly into the EMR database. This reduces human data entry errors and 
increases office productivity. In the future, we plan to incorporate this 
functionality by creating vital signs capture through the use of an integrating
software development kit for use with various diagnostic monitoring equipment 
manufacturers.

. Reduced user cost through the use of open source software: We believe we can 
  achieve a pricing advantage over our competitors, as our development will be 
  initially created from `open-source software.' and modified to suit our needs.
  As a result, our capital costs for development are reduced, which enables us 
  to pass these savings onto customers and reduce start-up costs for the 
  Company. Open source software is where the original creator provides the 
  rights to study, change and distribute the software for free to anyone and 
  for any purpose. Typically, open source software is found on the internet and
  is obtained at no cost, free of licensing fees, which enables us to pass on 
  those savings to our users 

. Data back-up: We plan to design our EMR database for instant back-up when 
  data is entered. The back up facilities can either be managed in house on 
  separate servers or with independent third party data storage facilities. 

. Physician/operator remote access: We are planning to offer physicians and 
  their approved operators the ability to remotely login and view patient 
  records via secure access. We believe remote access is a competitive 
  advantage that most other EMR providers do not provide, and is an invaluable 
  feature when physicians and care providers not in the office and require 
  patient data. 

. Data Security & Encryption: Data security must be a key aspect of our 
  software to comply with HIPAA security rules and ensure security measures are
  met. Encryption is the conversion of data into a form, often called 
  ciphertext, which cannot be understood by another party, human or machine, 
  without being decrypted first. Our software programs will be built to offer a
  high level of protection through the use of algorithms to scramble the 
  original input data into a new form which cannot be read without the use of 
  decryption keys. 

In order for our software and our company to be  successful,  we will first need
to alert our target market about our proposed EMR product and the  advantages we
intend to offer our prospective customers when our product is completed. We will
also  have to  develop  a  comprehensive,  ongoing  marketing  plan to sell  the
software.  We believe our marketing  and  promotion  strategy will be subject to
major revisions are we get closer to actually launching the product.


Company Description
Our Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 25, 2013 to 
engage in the development and sale of electronic medical record ("EMR") 
software for small and medium sized physician offices and clinics. 

We are in the early stages of developing our EMR software.  We currently have


 no
revenues,  no  operating  history,  and no users or  revenues  for our  proposed
software.  Our plan of operations over the 12 month period following  successful
completion  of our  offering is to gain support for our concept and create fully
functional EMR software.  This product,  when  completed,  will be  commercially
viable and available for commercial sale. Initially, the EMR software is planned
to be a software tool that will collect and capture patient data electronically,
and  store it in a  format  that  enables  efficient  access  and  viewing,  and
distribution  by  printing  or email.  We are also  planning  to design all data
fields with a text-based  editor to allow for physician and any other user notes
to be easily  entered and captured on the patient file. Our planned second phase
product  development  will focus on  interconnectivity  of our EMR software with
various third party vital signs  monitors,  such as blood  pressure  monitors or
temperature  monitors.  We will  achieve  this  by  developing  a  sophisticated
`software  development  kit',  or  software  tool which will  enable  diagnostic
manufacturers to have their vital sign monitors  "speak" to our system,  so that
patient  vital signs can be  correctly  and  electronically  captured in the EMR
system.  We  believe  this is very  important  to our  long  term  survival  and
profitability,  as it will increase clinical  workflow,  reduce clinic operating
costs and reduce patient errors for our clients,  and give us a competitive edge
over our competitors.

Our current planned  offering is only sufficient to complete  development of the
basic EMR  software.  We currently  estimate  that we will require an additional
$200,000 for the  commercial  launch of our basic EMR software and subsequent to
the  completion  of the basic EMR  software,  another 8-10 months and $50,000 to
develop the software  development kit for  interoperability  with third parties.
