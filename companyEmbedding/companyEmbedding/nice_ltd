SUMMARYBULLSBEARSTOPICSDATA CENTRALSTOCK CHARTSEC FILINGSBALANCEINCOMECASH FLOWNICE » Topics » ProductsThis excerpt taken from the NICE 20-F filed Jun 29, 2005.Products 
 
Our enterprise
interaction solutions include recording, monitoring, quality management and
business performance management solutions which are designed to capture
interactions, analyze them and take action based on this analysis to drive the
enterprise performance. They also protect businesses and customers against
risks posed by lost or misinterpreted voice or data transmissions and capture
and improve contact center agent performance and the customers
experience.  
 

Interaction
capture units (known as voice recorders or loggers) are systems that capture
and record large volumes of voice data transmitted over multiple telephone or
other communication lines and allow users to retrieve and playback specific
communication data. Traditional voice recorders were based on analog
reel-to-reel technology, which limited an organizations ability to store and
retrieve data efficiently, and which could not interface with digital computer
and telecommunication networks. In the early 1990s, analog reel-to-reel
recorders began to be replaced with analog VHS-based products and, more recently,
by digital products, including those based on magnetic disk, optical disk or
digital audio tapes (or DAT). 
Organizations growing needs to record, process and store large amounts
of voice data resulted in the introduction of digitally-based voice recording
systems characterized by increased performance and improved system
economics.  Digital multi-channel
recording systems enable simultaneous recording and logging of a large number
of channels, while enabling a large number of users to process voice data
simultaneously. Digital systems advantages over traditional analog systems
include the immediate random access to recorded data, open connectivity and
compact size of both the recording unit and storing and archiving media.
Advanced, industry-standard, digital voice recording systems employing computer
telephony integration (or CTI) technologies allow for integration of the
recording and retrieval functions with organizations computer and
telecommunications networks, thereby delivering maximum business benefits,
increased user efficiency, and wider access for larger numbers of users.  The demand for sophisticated CTI digital
voice recording systems is increasing as a result of the increased demand for
digital recording systems, particularly in the contact center market and the
conversion by the large installed base of analog systems to digital technology,
specifically in the financial institutions, public safety and air traffic
control markets.
 

Todays
business is characterized by increasing reliance upon interactions conducted
via telephony and web-based communications. These means of communication are
becoming an important and strategic dimension of business across a broad
spectrum of markets. In these business environments, a great deal of information
lies hidden within the ever-growing quantities of unstructured multimedia
interactions. This information can provide decision makers throughout the
enterprise with insights into their marketplace and customer base, and direct
access to key business scenarios. Many of these capabilities are not available
with traditional transactional-based analytics tools. They are of great value
to organizations constantly searching for better ways to understand their
market dynamics and customer intent, while operating within the limitations of
traditional surveying and data analysis techniques and growing regulatory
requirements. 
 
20







 
NICE Perform
is our flagship enterprise product. It is an integrated suite of solutions that
offers innovative ways for organizations to generate insight from interactions
to enhance performance. NICE Perform combines multiple data sources in a fully
integrated architecture with a centralized data warehouse, allowing
interoperability of all the data sources to address a variety of business
issues with a high level of accuracy. The data sources include word spotting,
emotion detection, talk pattern analysis, customer surveys, CTI analysis,
application activities and business data. With a set of advanced engines, NICE
Perform provides multi-dimensional analytics of these data sources.
State-of-the-art visualization techniques enable analysts and executives to
quickly and easily identify trends, deviations and situations requiring
immediate action. All these capabilities are implemented in an advanced
application suite that is underpinned by a new series of powerful high density
capture and archiving platforms that provide cost-effective reliable processing
of multimedia interactions in a format optimized for multi-dimensional
analytics. 
 
While
providing critical statistical data, NICE Perform goes beyond the scope of
transactional analytics to help decision makers understand customer intent and
market dynamics, identify current and future trends early enough for proactive
management of challenges, opportunities and changes, and enhance corporate
governance throughout the enterprise. For example, marketing executives can
more effectively track marketing campaigns, analyze causes of success or failure,
and quickly adapt to changing market conditions. Finance and legal executives
can ensure that company policies are adhered to in all phone conversations
across the organization, thereby avoiding costly legal action by spotting and
correcting irregularities before they become problems.
 
NICE Perform
also contains all of the contact center quality management capabilities of
NiceUniverse described below. In addition, NICE Perform includes advanced
online coaching capabilities. These enable supervisors to coach the contact
center agents in order to improve their skills and to empower those agents and
cover immediate knowledge dispersal matters as needed by the different
departments, such as marketing or order administration.  
 

NiceUniverse,
introduced in February 1998, is a comprehensive quality management solution
used to evaluate agent performance and to raise the level of customer service
in contact centers through advanced voice and desktop screen recording
technologies. The NiceUniverse system provides objective evaluation tools and
helps identify training requirements for contact center agents, including
real-time monitoring for instant access to live customer interactions and
enhanced reporting and administration features. NiceUniverse uses a CTI that integrates
with automatic call distributions (or ACDs). This enables NiceUniverse to
monitor and record agent sessions (voice and screen) on a user-defined schedule
and store them in compressed digital format. Sessions are later retrieved by
the reviewers from their network PCs or thin clients, and agent performance is
graded using customized on-screen templates. From these templates and other
data, NiceUniverse generates detailed reports, statistics and graphs to help
identify training requirements and set relevant benchmarks for contact center
agents.
 
NiceLog, our
digital voice recording system, is a computer telephony integrated
multi-channel voice recording and retrieval system. NiceLog is an open
architecture system based on PC architecture and advanced audio compression
technology that performs continuous, reliable

 
21







 

recordings of
up to thousands of analog and digital telephone lines, as well as radio
channels, and enables simultaneous access by multiple users. NiceLog can be
used either as a stand-alone unit or as part of a highly expandable and
scaleable system comprised of several seamlessly integrated units. Each NiceLog
unit can simultaneously record, monitor, archive and playback. The NiceLog System
includes client and web applications that enable users to access the system,
these applications communicated with the voice servers using the TCP/IP
communication protocol and can run on Windows 98/Me, Windows NT, Windows 2000
and Windows XP operating systems. The system can connect to telecommunication
interfaces such as T1, E1, ISDN and analog trunks as well as other more
specialized interfaces. The modular design of the NiceLog system makes it a
powerful voice management tool that can be expanded to satisfy customers needs
by integrating it with additional NiceLog units on the same local area network,
or LAN. 
 

Our patented
VoIP Capture Unit builds on our NiceLog technology to provide a complete
solution to audio storage in Voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) telephony
environments. The VoIP Capture Unit provides an IP-recording platform with a
wide range of scaleable recording solutions that supports the leading telephony
vendors. Our VoIP Capture Units are fully integrated with the NICE product
portfolio, making all our applications available for use over VoIP. NICE VoIP
Loggers can serve alongside other logger types in a mixed VoIP/non-VoIP
environment with the same familiar application software; users are unaware of
the voice capture method being used.
 
NICE VoIP
Capture Units can use both packet sniffing and active recording methods for
recording VoIP sessions. NICE VoIP active recording solutions integrate with
leading vendors such as Avaya, offering centralized recording of distributed
environments and other benefits.
 

NiceLogs
central storage option, NICE Storage Center, can integrate with various
enterprise storage networks (SAN, NAS or DAS) for long term or medium term
voice storage. Central storage sites can hold the entire voice recording from all
the organizations different sites thus reducing management costs and
redundancy. The retrieval process for voice on the central site is fully
automatic. 
 
NiceCall Focus
II is a voice recording system that records up to 32 input channels and
provides up to 66,000 hours of on-line voice storage capacity (using NICEs ACA
compression) and supports wide range of archiving devices for long-term storage
options. NiceCall Focus II offers a wide range of connectivity to PABX and
Radio systems and is built on the successful legacy of NiceCall Focus which was
introduced in 2001. NiceCall Focus II provides organizations that have a
relatively small number of input channels, such as public safety agencies, with
a competitively priced yet technologically advanced digital recording product
that offers many of the connectivity and processing features of NiceLog.
NiceCall Focus II is being targeted primarily at public safety facilities,
including 911 emergency centers and utilities, as well as small bank branches,
financial trading sites, and contact centers.

NICE Ltd.[3] (Hebrew: נייס מערכות‎‎) is an Israel-based company, specialising in telephone voice recording, data security, and surveillance, as well as systems that analyse this recorded data.[4]
The company serves various industries, such as financial services, telecommunications, healthcare, outsourcers, retail, media, travel, service providers, and utilities.
The company’s shares are traded on NASDAQ[5] as well as on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange; where it is part of the TA-25 Index.[6]
Barak Eilam became CEO in April 2014, replacing Zeevi Bregman. Eilam previously headed the company's Americas division.[7][8] As of December 31, 2016 the company had 4,930 employees.[2]
History[edit]
NICE was founded in 1986 as Neptune Intelligence Computer Engineering (NICE) by 7 Israeli former army colleagues. The company initially focused on developing technology for security and defense applications, but soon refocused their efforts on civilian applications, mainly for contact center, financial services and business intelligence markets. The company crossed US$350 million in bookings in 2005.[9]
In 2017, NICE Systems accidentally exposed 6 Million Records of Verizon customers by an improperly configured Amazon S3 storage device. "The records, which held logs from residential customers who had called Verizon customer service in the past six months, were accessed via an unprotected Amazon S3 storage server controlled by an employee of Nice Systems. Each record included the customer’s name, mobile number, and account PIN, along with their home address, email address, and their Verizon account balance. While some records were partially redacted, most were not. Anyone with access to the records could have theoretically impersonated a subscriber and been granted access to their account." [10]
