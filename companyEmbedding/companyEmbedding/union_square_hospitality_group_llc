During his time at Maialino, Sam played an integral role in developing the operational and Front of House systems that lead to the restaurant’s immediate popularity and critical success.In 2011, Sam became the General Manager of Union Square Cafe and in 2012 he became a Managing Partner of the restaurant.

During this exciting time, Sam will oversee the buildout of the new restaurant and ensure that Union Square Cafe’s signature warm hospitality makes the trip to the restaurant’s new home.Sam has been featured in Food & Wine, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg Businessweek, USA Today, Sommelier Journal, Nation’s Restaurant News, and many other publications. He has appeared as a regular guest on Martha Stewart Radio and as a panelist at the New York Wine and Food Festival.
