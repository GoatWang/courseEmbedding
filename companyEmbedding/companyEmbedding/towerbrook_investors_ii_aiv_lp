This Amendment No. 2 (Amendment No. 2) amends and supplements the statements on Schedule 13D filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 21, 2014 (the Original Schedule 13D), as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Original Schedule 13D filed on January 28, 2016 relating to the Class A Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (Class A Common Stock), of Ladder Capital Corp (the Company). The Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended as follows:
 
Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.
 
Item 3 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended, with effect from the date of the event giving rise to this Amendment No. 2, by adding the following at the end thereof:
 
On December 6, 2016, the Company entered into an Equity Underwriting Agreement with TI Holdings, AIV II, the other selling stockholders party thereto (collectively with TI Holdings and AIV II, the Selling Stockholders), and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, as representative of the several underwriters (the Underwriters), pursuant to which the Selling Stockholders agreed to (i) sell 10,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and (ii) provide the Underwriters an option to purchase an additional 1,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock (the Option Shares), in an underwritten offering (the December 2016 Offering). On December 7, 2016, the Underwriters elected their option to purchase the Option Shares.
 
In connection with the December 2016 Offering, on December 8, 2016, TI Holdings exchanged 2,769,150 shares of Class B Common Stock and Units into 2,769,150 shares of Class A Common Stock. No cash or other consideration was exchanged in connection with the foregoing exchanges.
 
Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.
 
Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended, with effect from the date of the event giving rise to this Amendment No. 2, by adding the following at the end thereof:
 
In connection with the December 2016 Offering, on December 12, 2016, TI Holdings completed a sale of 2,769,150 shares of Class A Common Stock to the Underwriters and AIV II completed a sale of 1,672,511 shares of Class A Common Stock to the Underwriters, in each case at a price of $13.056 per share.
 
In connection with the December 2016 Offering, TI Holdings and AIV II agreed, subject to specified exceptions, not to offer, pledge or sell, or enter into any agreement to sell or otherwise dispose of or transfer, any shares of Class A Common Stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Class A Common Stock, for a period of 60 days after December 6, 2016, except with the prior written consent of the Underwriters (the December 2016 Lock-Up Agreement).
 
References to and descriptions of the December 2016 Lock-up Agreement set forth above in this Item 4 do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the December 2016 Lock-Up Agreement, a form of which has been filed as Exhibit 6 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
 
Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
 
Item 5 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety, with effect from the date of the event giving rise to this Amendment No. 2, as follows:
 
The ownership percentages set forth below are based on 71,765,885 shares of Class A Common Stock and 37,822,629 Units and shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding as set forth in the Companys prospectus supplement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 7, 2016.
 
(a) TI Holdings directly owns 8,184,016 Units and shares of Class B Common Stock, representing 7.5% of the total number of Class A Common Stock outstanding, assuming that all vested and unvested Units outstanding, except those held directly or indirectly by the Company, together with all outstanding Class B Common Stock are exchanged into shares of Class A Common Stock. TI Holdings is jointly controlled by TowerBrook Investors II, L.P. (Fund II) and TowerBrook Investors II Executive Fund, L.P. (Executive Fund II), each of which is controlled by its sole general partner, TowerBrook Investors GP II, L.P. (Fund II GP), which is controlled by its sole general partner, TowerBrook Investors, Ltd. (TowerBrook and, together, with TI Holdings, AIV II, Fund II and Fund II GP, the TowerBrook Entities). As a result, TI Holdings, Fund II, Executive Fund II, Fund II GP and TowerBrook may be deemed to beneficially own the 8,184,016 Units and shares of Class B Common Stock owned by TI Holdings. As directors and joint controlling shareholders of TowerBrook, Neal Moszkowski and Ramez Sousou (together with the TowerBrook Entities, the Reporting Persons) may be deemed to beneficially own the 8,184,016 Units and shares of Class B Common Stock owned by TI Holdings.
 
10





 
(b) AIV II directly owns 4,942,979 shares of Class A Common Stock, representing 4.5% of the total number of Class A Common Stock outstanding, assuming that all vested and unvested Units outstanding, except those held by the Company, together with all outstanding Class B Common Stock are exchanged into shares of Class A Common Stock. AIV II is controlled by its general partner, Fund II GP, and Fund II GP is controlled by its general partner, TowerBrook. As a result, AIV II, Fund II GP and TowerBrook may be deemed to beneficially own the 4,942,979 shares of Class A Common Stock owned by AIV II. As directors and joint controlling shareholders of TowerBrook, Neal Moszkowski and Ramez Sousou may be deemed to beneficially own the 4,942,979 shares of Class A Common Stock owned by AIV II.
 
(c) The Reporting Persons have and will have the shared power to vote and dispose of the shares of the securities that they beneficially own, by virtue of the relationships described above.
 
(d) To the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, except as described in Items 3 and 4, none of the Reporting Persons has effected a transaction in Units, shares of Class B Common Stock or shares of Class A Common Stock during the past 60 days (other than transactions that may have been effected in the ordinary course of business in an agency or a fiduciary capacity).
 
Other than the Reporting Persons, no other person is known to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of the Reporting Persons securities.
 
(e) In connection with the December 2016 Offering, as of December 12, 2016, AIV II is no longer the holder of more than 5% of the Companys Class A Common Stock on an as-converted basis.

The Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended as follows:   Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.   Item 3 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended, with effect from the date of the event giving rise to this Amendment No. 6, by adding the following at the end thereof:   In connection with the Distribution (described below), on June 13, 2017, TI II Ladder Holdings, LLC (TI Holdings) exchanged 6,464,720 shares of Class B Common Stock and units of Series REIT of Ladder Capital Finance Holdings (LCFH) and units of Series TRS of LCFH (collectively, the Units) into 6,464,720 shares of Class A Common Stock (the Exchange). No cash or other consideration was exchanged in connection with the Exchange.   Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.   Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended, with effect from the date of the event giving rise to this Amendment No. 6, by adding the following at the end thereof:   On June 13, 2017, TI Holdings and TowerBrook Investors II AIV, L.P. (AIV II) distributed 3,122,353 and 1,877,647 shares of Class A Common Stock, respectively, to their investors (the Distribution).   Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.   Item 5 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety, with effect from the date of the event giving rise to this Amendment No. 6, as follows:   The ownership percentages set forth below are based on 86,024,028 shares of Class A Common Stock and 24,697,293 Units and shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding as set forth in the Companys Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 10, 2017, as adjusted for the Exchange.   (a) Immediately following the Distribution, TI Holdings directly owns 3,342,367 shares of Class A Common Stock, representing 3.0% of the total number of Class A Common Stock outstanding, assuming that all vested and unvested Units outstanding, except those held directly or indirectly by the Company, together with all outstanding Class B Common Stock are exchanged into shares of Class A Common Stock. TI Holdings is jointly controlled by TowerBrook Investors II, L.P. (Fund II) and TowerBrook Investors II Executive Fund, L.P. (Executive Fund II), each of which is controlled by its sole general partner, TowerBrook Investors GP II, L.P. (Fund II GP), which is controlled by its sole general partner, TowerBrook Investors, Ltd. (TowerBrook and, together, with TI Holdings, AIV II, Fund II and Fund II GP, the TowerBrook Entities). As a result, TI Holdings, Fund II, Executive Fund II, Fund II GP and TowerBrook may be deemed to beneficially own the 3,342,367 shares of Class A Common Stock owned by TI Holdings. As directors and joint controlling shareholders of TowerBrook, Neal Moszkowski and Ramez Sousou (together with the TowerBrook Entities, the Reporting Persons) may be deemed to beneficially own the 3,342,367 shares of Class A Common Stock owned by TI Holdings. Immediately following the Distribution, Neal Moszkowski and Ramez Sousou each directly owns 28,436 shares of Class A Common Stock.   9      (b) Immediately following the Distribution, AIV II directly owns 2,009,955 shares of Class A Common Stock, representing 1.8% of the total number of Class A Common Stock outstanding, assuming that all vested and unvested Units outstanding, except those held by the Company, together with all outstanding Class B Common Stock are exchanged into shares of Class A Common Stock. AIV II is controlled by its general partner, Fund II GP, and Fund II GP is controlled by its general partner, TowerBrook. As a result, AIV II, Fund II GP and TowerBrook may be deemed to beneficially own the 2,009,955 shares of Class A Common Stock owned by AIV II. As directors and joint controlling shareholders of TowerBrook, Neal Moszkowski and Ramez Sousou may be deemed to beneficially own the 2,009,955 shares of Class A Common Stock owned by AIV II.   (c) The Reporting Persons have and will have the shared power to vote and dispose of the shares of the securities directly held by TI Holdings and AIV II that they beneficially own, by virtue of the relationships described above. Neal Moszkowski and Ramez Sousou each has the sole power to vote and dispose of the 28,436 shares of Class A Common Stock each directly owns.   (d) To the best knowledge of the Reporting Persons, except as described in Items 3 and 4, none of the Reporting Persons has effected a transaction in Units, shares of Class B Common Stock or shares of Class A Common Stock during the past 60 days (other than transactions that may have been effected in the ordinary course of business in an agency or a fiduciary capacity).   Other than the Reporting Persons, no other person is known to have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or the proceeds from the sale of the Reporting Persons securities.   (e) As a result of the Distribution, on June 13, 2017, each of the Reporting Persons ceased to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of the Class A Common Stock. The filing of this Amendment No. 6 represents the final amendment to the Original Schedule 13D and constitutes an exit filing for the Reporting Persons.    Item 7.

Our approach
TowerBrook’s proven value creation strategy aims to transform the capabilities and the prospects of the businesses in which we invest.
We invest both through our Private Equity Funds and our Structured Opportunities Fund, allowing us to access a range of opportunities throughout the cycle. Our overall objective is to deliver superior, risk-adjusted returns to investors on a consistent and responsible basis. This requires a commitment to fundamental value and a highly disciplined approach to the assessment and management of our investments.
We work as a single, integrated team that has grown in parallel in Europe and the USA since the inception of TowerBrook. Our entrepreneurial, multinational and cross-cultural approach allows us to act with speed and certainty in multiple jurisdictions.
Read more about TowerBrook’s mission here and about our team members here.


Private Equity strategy
TowerBrook’s Private Equity strategy is to pursue control-oriented investments in large and mid-market companies, principally on a proprietary basis and often in situations characterised by complexity. These may include management/shareholder dislocation, a distressed parent company or an out-of-favour industry where we nonetheless identify attractive potential for significant growth.
The success of our strategy depends on our ability to choose well, to buy well, to structure our investments appropriately and to harness the right expertise to unlock growth. Our team of seasoned investment professionals is complemented by a network of experienced advisers. We work in close partnership with them and with highly talented senior managers to optimise the performance of our portfolio companies.


How we work










Paul Pindar, former Chief Executive of Capita plc, Chair of ICS and a member of our Senior Advisory Board, talks about partnering with TowerBrook.












Christophe Czajka, Executive Chair of Infopro Digital, talks about TowerBrook's support of the company's ambitious expansion plans.












Cathy Stauffer, Chair of Wilton, Chair of BevMo! and a member of our Senior Advisory Board, talks about how TowerBrook and management teams work together to build better businesses.




Structured Opportunities strategy
TowerBrook’s Structured Opportunities strategy leverages our experience and expertise to allow us to invest in opportunities that fall outside the investment parameters of our Private Equity strategy. We define structured opportunities as complex transactions incorporating contractual downside protection that take advantage of changing market conditions, or situation-specific events where traditional control-oriented Private Equity attributes may not apply.
Our Structured Opportunities investment universe includes multiple asset classes, from stressed and distressed debt instruments in both primary and secondary markets to structured equity and structured assets.


A responsible owner
We encourage our partners and portfolio companies to share our commitment to the principles of responsible ownership. Together, we are actively involved in helping to promote good practices that sustain not only the businesses in which we invest but the communities in which we operate.
Read more about our responsible ownership policy here.


 
TowerBrook supports Level 20, a not-for-profit organisation that works with industry leaders to attract and retain more women as senior professionals in European private equity.




 
TowerBrook is a member of the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA), the trade body for the UK private equity industry.
