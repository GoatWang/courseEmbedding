Aspertec 325 mg — The First-Ever Liquid-Fill Aspirin Capsule Approved by the FDA
Learn more






Home › About PLx 



Company Overview
We are a late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company initially focused on developing our clinically validated and patent-protected PLxGuard delivery system to provide safer and more effective aspirin products. Our PLxGuard delivery system works by releasing active pharmaceutical ingredients into the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine immediately below the stomach, rather than in the stomach itself. We believe this improves the absorption of many drugs currently on the market or in development, and reduces acute gastrointestinal (GI) side effects—including erosions, ulcers, and bleeding — associated with aspirin and ibuprofen, and potentially other drugs.

Our U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lead product, Aspertec 325 mg, is a novel formulation of aspirin that uses the PLxGuard delivery system to significantly reduce acute GI side effects while providing superior antiplatelet effectiveness for cardiovascular disease prevention as compared with the current standard of care, enteric coated aspirin. A companion 81 mg dose of the same novel formulation — Aspertec 81 mg —is in late-stage development and will be the subject of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) leveraging the already approved status of Aspertec 325 mg.

Our commercialization strategy will target both the over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription markets, taking advantage of the existing OTC distribution channels for aspirin while leveraging the FDA approval of Aspertec 325 mg and expected approval for Aspertec 81 mg for OTC and prescription use when recommended by physicians for cardiovascular disease treatment and prevention. Given our clinical demonstration of better antiplatelet efficacy (as compared with enteric coated aspirin) and better acute GI safety, we intend to use a physician-directed sales force to inform physicians—and, by extension, consumers—about our product’s clinical results in an effort to command both greater market share and a higher price for our superior aspirin product.
Our product pipeline also includes other oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) using the PLxGuard delivery system that may be developed, including a clinical-stage, GI-safer ibuprofen — PL1200 Ibuprofen 200 mg — for pain and inflammation.

PLx Pharma Appoints Natasha Giordano as CEO




Experienced Pharmaceutical Executive Brings 25 Years of Leadership 
      and Marketing Expertise 






January 04, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--PLx Pharma Inc. (PLx), a privately-held, late-stage specialty 
      pharmaceutical company initially focused on developing its clinically 
      validated and patent-protected PLxGuard™ delivery system to provide 
      safer and more effective aspirin products, announces that Natasha 
      Giordano has been appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer, 
      and as a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, effective January 
      1, 2016. Ms. Giordano will be replacing Ronald R. Zimmerman, who will 
      remain on the Board of Directors and continue in a role as Founder and 
      Senior Advisor providing support for pre-commercialization activities, 
      regulatory affairs, and business development.
    


      Ms. Giordano joins PLx Pharma with over 25 years’ experience as an 
      accomplished and versatile senior leader successfully achieving 
      enterprise-wide strategic and financial goals across industries with a 
      focus on Pharmaceuticals and Healthcare Technologies. Ms. Giordano is 
      proficient in building commercialization plans including developing 
      sales forces, raising capital, and is a skilled turnaround specialist 
      known for her novel risk mitigation approaches.
    

      "We are excited to welcome Natasha to the PLx team as she is a strong 
      leader with a broad range of sales, marketing, and management 
      experience, which will be a invaluable asset for PLx Pharma’s success 
      and future growth prospects,” noted Michael Valentino, Executive 
      Chairman of the Board of PLx. “Within our industry, Natasha is highly 
      valued for her decisive leadership skills, for building multi-functional 
      and international teams and for her proven track record of revenue and 
      profit growth. We are confident Natasha will be a driving force for PLx 
      as we transition from the development phase to the commercial launch of 
      our lead product, PL2200 Aspirin, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      approved aspirin product that has clinically demonstrated more reliable 
      and predictable antiplatelet efficacy compared with enteric coated 
      aspirin.”
    

      "I am excited to be joining PLx Pharma at this critical pre-launch 
      inflection point,” stated Ms. Giordano. “PL2200 Aspirin fills a 
      substantial medical need to provide high-risk cardiovascular and 
      neurology patients with more reliable and predictable antiplatelet 
      efficacy while reducing the adverse gastric events common in an acute 
      setting with enteric coated aspirin. I look forward to building on the 
      compelling clinical data and initial market access work the PLx 
      management team has begun and to successfully launching PL2200 Aspirin 
      into the U.S. market in 2017.”
    

      Prior to joining PLx Pharma, Ms. Giordano was President and CEO of Clear 
      Point Learning, where she was responsible for positioning the Company 
      for growth and for developing market messaging and sales strategies 
      centered on partnering with Pharmaceutical companies to launch new 
      products. Previous to that, Ms. Giordano was President and CEO of 
      Healthcare Corporation of America, where she positioned the Company for 
      a successful sale of its Pharmaceutical Benefits Management subsidiary, 
      increased profitable revenue, raised capital, launched a Healthcare 
      Technology Division. From 2010 to 2012, Ms. Giordano was the President 
      and CEO of Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals, a privately held specialty 
      pharmaceutical company, where she built a 150- person sales force and 
      successfully launched Zipsor into the pain market. Earlier in her 
      career, Ms. Giordano served in numerous roles at Cegedim, a global sales 
      and marketing effectiveness solution provider, including President of 
      Americas, following the firm’s acquisition of Dendrite. Before that, Ms. 
      Giordano was the Director, Strategic Alliances & Sales Integration for 
      Parke-Davis/Pfizer. There, she effectively deployed annual marketing 
      plans for three multi-billion dollar strategic alliance partners, and 
      led a primary care sales team, which grew to be ranked #1 nationally. 
      Ms. Giordano also serves on the Board of Aceto Corporation (ACET).
    

      Ms. Giordano received a B.S. in Nursing from Wagner College in New York.
    

About PLx Pharma


      PLx Pharma Inc. is a late-stage specialty pharmaceutical company 
      initially focused on developing our clinically validated and 
      patent-protected PLxGuard™ delivery system to provide safer and more 
      effective aspirin products. Our PLxGuard™ delivery system works by 
      releasing active pharmaceutical ingredients into the duodenum, the first 
      part of the small intestine immediately below the stomach, rather than 
      in the stomach itself. We believe this improves the absorption of many 
      drugs currently on the market or in development, and reduces acute 
      gastrointestinal (GI) side effects—including erosions, ulcers and 
      bleeding—associated with aspirin and ibuprofen, and potentially other 
      drugs. To learn more about the Company and its pipeline, please visit www.plxpharma.com.

      historical facts, such as statements regarding assumptions and results 
      related to financial results forecast, commercial results, timing and
