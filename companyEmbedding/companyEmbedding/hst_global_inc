HST Global Announces Launch of Focus-Up




Joint Venture Will Extend HST’s Market Penetration beyond Its Core 
      Platform into a $20 Billion Annual Market






July 21, 2009 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



HAMPTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--HST Global, Inc. (OTCBB: HSTC) today announced the launch of a cognitive 
      function product endorsed and recommended by Dr. Kyl Smith under a Joint 
      Venture with Dalham, LLC (an affiliate company of The Health Network, 
      Inc.). The Company intends to launch the new product on August 1, 2009. 
      The new product will be named Focus-Up®.
    

      Ron Howell, CEO/President stated, “With the North American Baby Boomer 
      population standing at 80 million, one out of every three Americans will 
      be age 50 or over by 2010. These facts, in conjunction with continued 
      advances in age and condition-specific products and technologies bode 
      well for the industry as a whole. There is an especially robust market 
      for Focus-Up®, particularly among these older consumers. In fact, market 
      research shows that this category will lead gains in its $20 billion 
      industry in the US alone.”
    

      Dr. Kyl Smith stated, “HST plans to mature the expansion and development 
      of two unique product lines; a physician-formulated 'all natural' 
      nutritional product line designed to address wellness challenges and 
      provide preventative maintenance and support overall health; and a 
      Medical Food line providing new and novel physician-based therapeutic 
      approaches that positively impact patients with immune and degenerative 
      disorders, who are in need of effective, well-tolerated treatments. This 
      will allow HST to concentrate on the acquisition of patent applications 
      and technologies that the company controls from formulation through to 
      consumer application as well as integrating the educational process 
      necessary to help patients understand the underlying need for good 
      nutrition in achieving and maintaining optimum health.”
    

      More information about our new product can be found at www.focusup.com. 
      You can also visit www.brightermind.com

A New Energy in Immunoscience






 

Focused  on the Solution 
HST Global, a publically  held biotechnology and wellness company, discovers and develops breakthroughs in supporting and treating metabolic disorders associated with cancer and other  life threatening illnesses. HST Global’s new and novel therapeutic approaches positively impact patients with disorders associated with late stage cancer who  are in need of supportive well-tolerated treatments. Through its proprietary  scientific platform, HST Global is developing therapies that address metabolic  deficiencies, dysfunction, or disorders, and provides an alternative source of  support for patients.
  The growing acceptance of  alternative and integrative cancer treatments worldwide has placed HST Global in a perfect position to launch its own brand of Cancer Treatment Centers  worldwide. While the company continues to seek acquisition of in-licensing  pre-clinical drug candidates, this strategy will enable the company to address  the challenges individuals face in the supportive treatment of cancer in the  later stages. 
  HST Global, Inc. has been  involved with pre-clinical novel drug candidates that suggest a high efficacy in the treatment of various cancers. The interest of physicians in these supportive treatments has given the company a position of visibility that has attracted a  number of International partners that desire to open HST affiliated Centers  worldwide. 
As  such, the company is in the process of developing a privately branded chain of  Cancer Treatment Centers strategically positioned around the world. The  distribution channel established through these Cancer Treatment Centers will serve as a platform for the implementation of existing technologies and serve  to identify appropriate communities for treatment with new and emerging novel drug  candidates as they become available.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
