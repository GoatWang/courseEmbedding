IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND IRS CIRCULAR 230 NOTICE 

������This material has been prepared for information purposes to support the promotion or marketing
of the transaction or matters addressed herein.��This is not a research report and was not prepared by the Morgan Stanley research department.��It was prepared by Morgan Stanley sales, trading, banking or other non-research personnel.��This
material was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under U.S. federal tax laws.��Each taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer�s
particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance. Please see additional important information and qualifications at the end of this material. 

STATEMENT REGARDING THIS FREE WRITING PROSPECTUS  

������The depositor has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the
offering to which this communication relates.��Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents the depositor has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and
this offering.��You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC web site at www.sec.gov.��Alternatively, the depositor or any underwriter or any dealer participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-866-718-1649.


Important NoticeInformation presented is for the period 12/1/2006 to 2/28/2007 unless otherwise stated

�



FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 

We have included in this document, and from time to time may make in other public statements, certain statements that may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
are not historical facts and represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and beyond our control. 

The nature of our business makes predicting future trends difficult. The risks and uncertainties involved in our business could affect the matters referred to in such statements and it is possible
that our actual results may differ from the anticipated results indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include (without limitation): 


decreases in residential real estate values, which could reduce both the credit quality of our mortgage loan portfolio and the ability of borrowers to use their home equity to obtain cash through
mortgage loan refinancing, which would adversely impact our ability to produce new mortgage loans; 

changes in overall regional or local economic conditions or changes in interest rates, particularly those conditions that affect demand for new housing, housing resales or the value of houses;


our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy throughout the various cycles experienced by our industry; 

greater than expected declines in consumer demand for residential mortgage loans, particularly sub-prime, non-conforming loans; 

our ability to sustain loan production growth at historical levels; 

continued availability of financing facilities and access to the securitization markets or other funding sources; 

deterioration in the credit quality of our loan portfolio and the loan portfolios of others serviced by us; 

challenges in successfully expanding our servicing platform and technological capabilities; 

increased competitive conditions or changes in the legal and regulatory environment in our industry; and  

other risks and uncertainties detailed in this document and in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Accordingly, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date on which they are made.��We undertake no obligation to update
publicly or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the dates they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law.��You
should, however, consult further disclosures we may make in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Important NoticeInformation presented is for the period 12/1/2006 to 2/28/2007 unless otherwise stated

Assess customers ability and willingness to pay: 

Financial packages obtained 

Review of credit score, Freddie Mac Early Indicator Score (EIS) score and reason for default  

A BPO is obtained and an estimate of total recovery is determined based on historical foreclosure and REO timelines & expenses. 

Using Saxon�s Default Resolution Plan (DRP) System, a loss mitigation decision is made to deliver the best economical outcome for the customer and investor. 

If a repayment plan is used, Saxon requires that the customer be committed. 

Commitment is measured by ability to contribute 30-50% of the outstanding delinquency upfront.��� 

A customer�s EIS score is one of the determining factors as to the amount of down payment required coupled with customer�s recent payment history/broken plans.��
