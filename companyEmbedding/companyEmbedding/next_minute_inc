Invoicing & Quoting




Say Goodbye to Manual Invoicing














 





Getting paid promptly is important to any business, we've taken a headache out of keeping up to date with invoicing. You can create invoices on the go, the faster customers get your bill the faster they can pay. Your invoices are structured in a way that is easy for both the team to generate and for customers to understand.

You can keep track of your invoices easily as they are organised alongside the job and client profiles. You can also access reports and a dashboard to see at a glance the status of your billing activity.

Invoice information is recorded with the job and automatically flows through to the your accounting software.  Business as usual just got a whole lot easier.












Quote Fast, Earn Fast 














 




 
 Real-time job activity means your field service team can quote, order, record charges and create invoices on site. Creating quotes, purchase orders and invoices right from within NextMinute are very fast and efficient.


We've put a lot of thought into how customers want to operate in the field. We enable easy quoting from any device (via iOS and Android apps). Data load speeds are fast, adding charges are quick and sale items are organised. It really is possible to quote and invoice on the job with the NextMinute app, it's been carefully crafted to work well on all devices.

“I use NextMinute to schedule the contractors cleaning jobs. This has been excellent. Then I realised that there was much more functionality.  Because of the repetitive nature of my business invoicing and quotes, it’s easy to set up templates to reuse. This reduces my admin time immensely.” 

​LYNN MCCRINDLE, HYGIENE FACTOR

How to Make the Next 30 Minutes the Most Productive of Your Week


One small adjustment to how you work could make every 30 minutes twice as productive.

Constant connectivity is both a blessing and a curse for productivity.
On the one hand, the ability to carry out tasks and answer work-related emails on the move, wherever and whenever, is incredibly powerful. Your 30-minute train ride to the office no longer has to be 30 minutes of staring out the window, and instead you can make headway into the day's work before you've even set foot in the office.
On the other hand, the constant pinging of emails arriving to your laptop, tablet, mobile phone, and even your wristwatch can prove a distraction when you're trying to make your way through specific tasks.
If, as a recent UK study suggests, most aspiring company founders are initially driven by flexibility, then there's no understating the value of getting more done in every single minute you work.
One Small Change for Improved Productivity
The Pomodoro technique is nothing new, having been first developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It's a time-management method that works on the principle that you focus on a task for 25 minutes and then take a break for five minutes. You repeat this as needed. The approach to this technique is:

Determine what task you need to complete (write it down if necessary).


Set a timer for 25 minutes (this can be varied if you find it better to focus in shorter or longer stints).


Work solely on the task you set out to complete over that time. If something pops into your mind about another task, make a note of it and ignore it until after the time set. Emails should be switched off, and your phone should be silenced.

At the end of each 25-minute stint, take a break of five minutes. After four stints, a longer break is recommended.  
What Makes It Effective?
Studies prove that attempting to multitask slows down progress on all of the tasks we are trying to complete.
The Pomodoro technique forces you to focus on a single task, eradicating the negative effects of attempted multitasking. This focus has an immediate positive impact on your productivity.
But there's a second benefit, too. By focusing in short stints with a break, you do the work equivalent of a sprint rather than a cross-country run. And when you sprint, you aim for speed. The short time stints with brief refreshers in between appear to enhance your work speed.
Use Cases
Personally, I use this technique for three key things:

Writing marketing reports (tasks that should be relatively quick but that with distractions can be drawn out far longer than necessary)
Writing marketing-strategy documentation
Copywriting

The third use case in that list has been the one where I've seen the greatest increase in output over these half-hour periods.
For the seven months that I've carried out copywriting tasks in Pomodoro stints, I've been able to cut the time it takes me to produce a typical page of web copy in half. I write a lot, so this has been huge. Where I formerly set aside 16 hours of my week to write, I'm now setting aside eight and actually delivering more content than I was before.
More Than Double Your Output
I'm not the only one who is getting results. This case study suggests that the technique can cut 40 hours of work to just 16.7 hours.
But the only way to know how it can affect your productivity is to try it out. If you're going to do so, I'd recommend:

Don't use your phone timer. It gives you an excuse to check your phone because you have it in hand. Use a stopwatch or timer separate from your phone.
Turn desktop notifications off on the computer you're working on and close your email.
Make sure you're working in a room where you can close the door and not be disturbed.

So put down your phone, grab your timer, and make the next 30 minutes the most productive of your working week.
