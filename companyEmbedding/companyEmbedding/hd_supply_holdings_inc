    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Adjusted EBITDA was $207 million compared to $215 million a year ago. Adjusted net income was $127 million or $0.63 per diluted share compared to $103 million or $0.51 per diluted share a year ago. The increase in adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share reflects the reduction in its interest expense from the recent improvements in its capital structure. There were approximately 203 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding during the first quarter of 2017. 


The company provided earnings guidance for the second quarter of 2017. For the second quarter 2017, net sales are anticipated to be in the range of $1,325 million and $1,365 million, adjusted EBITDA in the range of $200 million and $210 million and adjusted net income per diluted share in the range of $0.60 and $0.65.


The company expects GAAP tax rate to be approximately 37% in fiscal 2017. This is a reduction from its prior estimate as it recorded an $11 million tax credit in the tax provision during the first quarter for the excess tax deduction over book expense for stock compensation in the first quarter in accordance with the new accounting standard. The company expects total sales for fiscal 2017 excluding Waterworks to be in the range of $5 billion and $5,100,000,000, EBITDA to be in the range of $700 million and $730 million and net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.02 and $2.17.

	Item 1.01 Conflict Minerals Disclosure and Report





	 





	Conflict Minerals Disclosure





	 





	Introduction





	 




	HD Supply Holdings, Inc. and HD Supply, Inc. (collectively with their direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, HD Supply or the Company) comprise one of the largest industrial distributors in North America. We believe we have leading positions in the three distinct market sectors in which we specialize: Maintenance, Repair & Operations; Infrastructure; and Specialty Construction. We operate through approximately 500 locations across 48 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. We have approximately 13,000 associates delivering localized, customer-tailored products, services and expertise. We serve approximately 530,000 customers, which include contractors, government entities, maintenance professionals, home builders and industrial businesses. Our broad range of end-to-end product lines and services include approximately 845,000 stock-keeping units of quality, name-brand and proprietary-brand products as well as value-add services supporting the entire life-cycle of a project from infrastructure and construction to maintenance, repair and operations.




	 




	The Company does not directly manufacture products but contracts to manufacture based on its suppliers branded and generic products containing metallic forms of gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum (or 3TGs).  The efforts described herein were undertaken on the exclusive and/or privately-branded products which we sourced directly or were otherwise specifically manufactured for the Company during calendar year 2016.




	 




	Certain HD Supply products contain materials or components that use metallic forms of tin, tantalum, tungsten and/or gold.  Generally speaking, the amount of information available globally on the traceability and sourcing of these ores is limited at this time.  The Company has taken steps to identify the applicable smelters and refiners of such 3TG metals in our supply chain; however, due to the depth of the supply chain, the Company is far removed from the sources of ore from which these metals are produced and the smelters/refiners that process those ores.  The Company relies on its suppliers to provide information on the origin of any conflict minerals contained in components and materials supplied to us.




	 





	Reasonable Country of Origin Inquiry (RCOI)





	 




	Direct suppliers were asked to provide answers to the Supply Chain Questionnaire adapted from the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition-Global e-Sustainability Initiatives (EICC-GeSI) Conflict Minerals Common Reporting Template (CMRT) reflecting HD Supplys position on the supply chain.  The CMRT was developed by several of the worlds leading consumer electronics companies and is regarded as the most common reporting tool for conflict minerals content and sourcing information worldwide.




	 




	The Company reviewed the questionnaires received for completeness and consistency of answers.  Suppliers were required to provide corrections and clarifications where needed.




	 




	As such, the Company believes the RCOI process followed was reasonably designed and performed in good faith.  However, there are inherent limitations in the information provided by third parties including but not limited to potential inaccuracies, incompleteness or falsified information despite the Companys efforts to validate and confirm the information.




	 



	2













	 





	Determination





	 




	Since the Company received inconclusive data from our direct suppliers, the Company is unable to make a definitive determination about the sources of the 3TGs contained in the majority of  its products subject to inquiry by Rule 13­p1 for the period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016 (the Reporting Period). However, with respect to a small minority of  products subject to inquiry by Rule 13­p1 for the Reporting Period, the Company did receive information from some direct suppliers that leads the Company to believe that there is reason to believe that 3TGs contained in those certain products may have originated in the Democratic Republic of  Congo or an adjoining country (collectively, the Covered Countries) or did not come from recycled or scrap sources.




	 




	Pursuant to the Public Statement issued by the SECs Division of Corporation Finance on April 7, 2017, we have only provided the disclosure required under the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of Item 1.01 of Form SD.




	 





	Additional Information





	 




	A copy of the information contained in this Form SD is also publicly available on our website at http://ir.hdsupply.com, but the contents of that site are not incorporated by reference into, and are not otherwise a part of, this Form SD.




	 




	This Form SD contains statements that are forward looking, as that term is defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases.  Forward-looking statements also include any statement that is not based on historical fact, including statements containing the words believes, may, plans, will, could, should, estimates, continues, anticipates, intends, expects, and similar expressions.  The Company intends that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby.  All forward-looking statements are based on current expectations regarding important risk factors and should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person that the results expressed therein will be achieved.  We assume no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.  Important factors that could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement include those described in the Companys reports, including its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2017, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2017, and our other forms filed with the SEC from time to time which can be found at the SECs website at www.sec.gov.  Any references to the Companys website in this Form SD is for convenience only and the contents of that site are not incorporated by reference into, and are not otherwise a part of, this Form SD.
