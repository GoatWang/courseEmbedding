Hands On-Review: LowePro DroneGuard Kit, a Lightweight Transport for Drones
Read More 


























Drone Guard Kit Product Video


DroneGuard Series - Designed Just for Drones - Lowepro


Lowepro 50th - Adventure Awaits





Typically you have two choices when selecting a case for your quadcopter: a case with custom-fitted foam that only works with one specific model/series or generic dividers or pick-and-pluck, both of which are optimized for rectangular shapes, and do not closely fit the contour of your aircraft. With the DroneGuard Kit from Lowepro  there is a third way: a modular interior with main compartment dividers that are both adjustable while curved to accommodate most X-configuration quadcopters in the size range of the DJI Phantom series. The case opens a bit like a toolbox with the quadcopter sitting in the middle and two large main compartments at either end. These compartments are ideal for batteries, a charger, transmitter, FPV goggles, GoPro or other action camera, or other larger items. Within one of these cavities are adjustable/removable sub-divides to further organize your accessories. The compartments themselves can also be fully removed for easily access or if they are not needed. Additionally, the sidewalls of the case fold open and feature straps that handily accommodate tools, spare props, and cables. They also unzip providing internal storage of flat items such as a smartphone or small mobile device. When closed, retention straps and an elastic loop system help hold everything in place for safe transport.






										
												Keep all parts of a drone kit organized,
neat, and within easy reach
										  
										 




										
												Carry your kit with ease with this lightweight
and portable solution
										  
										 




										
												The modular design may be configured for
multiple uses and scenarios
										  
										 




										
												Protective and supporting dividers keep
all parts tightly arranged
										  
										 

Design Features 



										
												Kit is built to secure and protect
gear with retention straps, elastic
loop system, rigid base, padded and
adjustable dividers, and durable
materials that resist moisture and
abrasion
										  
										 




										
												Detachable battery box
includes four padded and
removable dividers
										  
										 




										
												Zippered sidewall pockets
keep loose parts and
manuals secured and
within easy reach
										  
										 




										
												Hook-and-loop attachment
system with velex for
easy configuration
										  
										 




										
												Rigid and protective
tray with honeycomb
interior, plus
comfortable carry
straps

Reflections on the Consolidated Text of the Spanish Land Use Act of 2008 : Increased power of the arbitrary, fostering of corruption, and increased upward pressure on land values

            Melián, Gonzalo; Calzada, Gabriel
        

            •This work contains a political and economic analysis of the Consolidated Text of the Spanish Land Use Act of 2008.•This land legislation increases public intervention in land management.•Among the effects of this legislation are that it encourages speculation, fosters corruption, and increases the pressure on land values to rise.•This legislation eliminates the principle of indemnity in the expropriation of property, and generates great juristic-economic uncertainty.•Some articles of this land legislation may be considered unconstitutional.

All rights reserved.1. IntroductionLegislation on land use and ownership is a key issue in theSpanish political arena for two reasons: the political corruptionassociated with land transactions and reallocation/reclassiﬁcationin Spain1and the market rise in the price of housing (from 2001to 2007), which was subsequently followed by a fall (from 2008to 2015). There are two potential ways to solve these problems: onthe one hand, by trusting that savers, consumers, and investors willbe able to work together in the marketplace, armed with informa-tion on the situation of relative scarcity consequent on free prices(Hayek, 1972a, 1972b), and on the other, by continuing with thecentralized planning of land management that has been dominantin Spain since the passing of the ﬁrst Land Use Act in in 1956(1956 Land Law hereafter) (regulating and re-regulating the per-∗Corresponding author.E-mail addresses: gmelian@faculty.ie.edu (G.

These overlapping interventions andregulations often cause the economic agencies at work to altertheir attitudes in unpredictable ways, making legislative attemptsto solve the problem by regulating enormously complicated andcounterproductive (Peltzman, 2007).The political project at the heart of the Real Decreto Legislativo,2008Real Decreto Legislativo 2/2008, de 20 de junio, por el que seaprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de suelo – in English, the Con-solidated Text of the Land Use Act of 2008 (2008 Consolidated Texthereafter) – following a tradition started in the middle of the lastcentury, is a product of this reality.
