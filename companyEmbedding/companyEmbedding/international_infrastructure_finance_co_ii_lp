Industry Perspective Looking at it from Our Angle: KKR’s View of Energy Infra + Read more
The scale of global infrastructure investment demand is enormous, and there is a growing need to replace and expand international infrastructure including all parts of the energy supply chain and a wide array of public services such as roads, railways, airports, and communications networks. Initiatives in these areas have become more difficult due to a reduction in traditional public funding and weakened economic conditions in many regions of the world. These resource issues have created a heightened need for experienced private capital.
We are committed to helping to meet this resource imbalance by investing in infrastructure assets on a global basis. Our goal is to achieve returns through the acquisition and operational improvement of infrastructure assets, which are important to the functioning of regional and local economies. We look to use these investments to generate current income and capital appreciation for investors in our funds.

            WHAT IS CPD?

            CPD stands for Continuing Professional Development’. It is essentially a philosophy,
            which maintains that in order to be effective, learning should be organised and
            structured. The most common definition is:
        

‘A commitment to structured skills and knowledge enhancement for Personal or Professional
            competence’


            CPD is a common requirement of individual membership with professional bodies and
            Institutes. Increasingly, employers also expect their staff to undertake regular
            CPD activities.
        

            Undertaken over a period of time, CPD ensures that educational qualifications do
            not become obsolete, and allows for best practice and professional standards to
            be upheld.
        

            CPD can be undertaken through a variety of learning activities including instructor
            led training courses, seminars and conferences, e:learning modules or structured
            reading.
        

            CPD AND PROFESSIONAL INSTITUTES

            There are approximately 470 institutes in the UK across all industry sectors, with
            a collective membership of circa 4 million professionals, and they all expect their
            members to undertake CPD.
        

            For some institutes undertaking CPD is mandatory e.g. accountancy and law, and linked
            to a licence to practice, for others it’s obligatory. By ensuring that their members
            undertake CPD, the professional bodies seek to ensure that professional standards,
            legislative awareness and ethical practices are maintained.
        

            CPD Schemes often run over the period of a year and the institutes generally provide
            online tools for their members to record and reflect on their CPD activities.
        

            TYPICAL CPD SCHEMES AND RECORDING OF CPD (CPD points and hours)

            Professional bodies and Institutes CPD schemes are either structured as ‘Input’
            or ‘Output’ based.
        

‘Input’ based schemes list a precise number of CPD hours that individuals must achieve
            within a given time period. These schemes can also use different ‘currencies’ such
            as points, merits, units or credits, where an individual must accumulate the number
            required. These currencies are usually based on time i.e. 1 CPD point = 1 hour of
            learning.
        

‘Output’ based schemes are learner centred. They require individuals to set learning
            goals that align to professional competencies, or personal development objectives.
            These schemes also list different ways to achieve the learning goals e.g. training
            courses, seminars or e:learning, which enables an individual to complete their CPD
            through their preferred mode of learning.
        

            The majority of Input and Output based schemes actively encourage individuals to
            seek appropriate CPD activities independently.
        

            As a formal provider of CPD certified activities, SMI Group can provide an indication
            of the learning benefit gained and the typical completion. However, it is ultimately
            the responsibility of the delegate to evaluate their learning, and record it correctly
            in line with their professional body’s or employers requirements.
        

            GLOBAL CPD

            Increasingly, international and emerging markets are ‘professionalising’ their workforces
            and looking to the UK to benchmark educational standards. The undertaking of CPD
            is now increasingly expected of any individual employed within today’s global marketplace.

 Scheme for Financing Viable Infrastructure Projects through a Special Purpose Vehicle called the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) (Revised)

 1.  Preamble 
A.  Whereas the Government of India recognizes that there is a significant deficit in the availability of physical infrastructure across different sectors and that this is hindering economic development
B.  Whereas the development of infrastructure requires debt of longer maturity to supplement the debt funds presently available; and
C.  Whereas the Government of India recognizes that such debt is usually not available because of the following constraints:
(i) Absence of benchmark rates for raising long term debt from the market;
(ii)Asset - liability mismatch of the tenor of debt in case of most financial institutions; and
(iii) High cost of long term debt
D.  Now, therefore, the Government of India has decided to put into effect the following Scheme for providing financial support to improve the viability of infrastructure projects.
2.  Short Title and Extent
2.1 The Scheme will be called the Scheme for financing Viable Infrastructure Projects.  It will be administered by the Ministry of Finance through IIFCL.
2.2 The modified Scheme will come into force with effect from 30th March 2015.
3.  Definitions
In this Scheme unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) Empowered Committee means a Committee set up for the purposes of this Scheme consisting of Secretary (Economic Affairs), Secretary, Planning commission, Secretary (Expenditure) and Secretary (Financial Sector) as Convener and in his absence Special Secretary / Additional Secretary (Financial Sector) and Secretary of the line Ministry dealing with the subject. 
(b) IIFCL means the India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (A company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956).
(c) Lead Bank means the Bank/Financial Institution (FI) that is funding the project and is designated as such by the Inter-Institutional Group or consortium of Banks/Financial Institutions. In case of multiple banking arrangements, the bank / institution having largest exposure would be treated as Lead Bank.
(d)  Long Term Debt means the Debt provided by the IIFCL to the project company where the average maturity for repayment exceeds 10 years (8.5 years in the case of IIFC(UK) Ltd). However, in case of project loans where the flexible structuring model (5/25 model) is adopted by the consortium of lenders, the average maturity for repayment should be of 5 years.
(e) Private Sector Company means a company in which 51% or more of the subscribed and paid-up equity is owned and controlled by private entities;
(f) Project Company means the company which is implementing the infrastructure project for which assistance is to be given by the IIFCL.
(g) Project Term means the duration of the contract or concession agreement for a PPP project.
(h) Public Private Partnership (PPP) Project means a project based on a contract or concession agreement, between a Government or a statutory entity on the one side and a Private Sector Company on the other-side, for delivering an infrastructure service on payment of user charges; 
(i) Public Sector Company means a company in which 51% or more of the subscribed and paid-up equity is owned and controlled by the Central or a State Government, jointly or severally, and includes any undertaking designated as such by the Department of Public Enterprises and companies in which majority stake is held by Public Sector Companies other than financial institutions. 
(j) Total Project Cost means the total capital cost of the project as approved by the Lead Bank subject to the condition that IIFCL should be able to cover the risk between the PPPAC approved cost and the Lead Bank approved cost by seeking guarantees from the holding company or any other form of recourse.
(k) Subordinate Debt means a debt which ranks lower in security than the project debt carrying a pari passu charge.
4. Sources of funding for IIFCL
4.1 Apart from equity, IIFCL shall be funded through debt raised from the following sources:
(a) Rupee debt raised from the market, through suitable instruments created for the purpose; while the IIFCL would ordinarily raise debt of maturity of 10 years and beyond, for the purpose of repayment / retiring of higher cost debt in a falling interest rate regime, the IIFCL may raise shorter term debt.
(b) Debt from bilateral or multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. Foreign currency debt, including through external commercial borrowings raised with prior approval of the Government.
(c) Short term debt from banks/financial institutions only for the purpose of managing Asset–Liability mismatch or for refinancing to the extent of its Net Worth at any given point of time.
4.2 IIFCL would raise funds as and when required. The funds so raised may be utilised for on-lending and surplus funds may be invested in marketable government securities (G-Sec and T-Bills) and / or Certificates of Deposit, Fixed Deposits and, for Treasury Management purposes, in AAA rated PSU Corporate Bonds,
4.3 The borrowings of IIFCL may be guaranteed by the Government of India. The extent of guarantees to be provided shall be set at the beginning of each fiscal year by the Ministry of Finance, within the limits available under the Fiscal Responsibility & Budget Management Act.
4.4 The guarantee fee payable by IIFCL and IIFC (UK) would be as decided by Ministry of Finance from time to time.
4.5 The facility of guarantees including the terms for guarantee will be reviewed in the Ministry of Finance from time to time and its continuation shall be subject to the outcome of the review.
