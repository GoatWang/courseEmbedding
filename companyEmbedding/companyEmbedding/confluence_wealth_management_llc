Equity Strategies

Our equity investment philosophy is a bottom-up, fundamental approach that seeks to generate above-average returns over the long-term by identifying businesses that possess substantial competitive advantages and are trading at discounts to intrinsic value. Advantages may include strong brand names, highly differentiated services or products, dominant market share, flexible pricing power, protected technology or specialized industrial skills sets. Companies have the ability to generate high levels of cash flow and are led by management teams that are true stewards for creating shareholder wealth.
The investment process focuses on managing risk, which we define as the probability of a permanent loss of capital, by owning quality businesses at attractive valuations. This discipline strives to protect investors on the downside while enhancing upside potential. Over time, we believe that this approach positions the portfolio to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns.

Large Cap ValueThe Large Cap Value portfolio is focused on seasoned businesses that generally have capitalizations above $10 billion. The portfolio is typically comprised of 23-25 holdings and is expected to result in low to moderate turnover. Large Cap Value is suitable for clients whose primary objective is capital appreciation and whose secondary objective is dividend income.

Small Cap ValueThe Small Cap Value portfolio is focused on smaller businesses that generally have capitalizations below $3 billion. The portfolio is typically comprised of 30-35 holdings and is expected to result in low to moderate turnover. Because small cap stocks are generally more volatile than large cap stocks, the Small Cap Value portfolio is suitable for clients whose primary objective is capital appreciation.

Equity IncomeThe Equity Income portfolio is focused on businesses that range in market capitalization and collectively generate an above-average stream of dividend income, while also providing capital appreciation potential. The research process seeks to identify businesses that have the ability to either pay a high level of dividend income or grow the dividend stream over time. The portfolio is typically comprised of 30-35 holdings and is expected to result in low to moderate turnover. Equity Income is suitable for clients seeking total return from dividend income and capital appreciation.

Increasing Dividend Equity Acct.The Increasing Dividend Equity Account (IDEA) is focused on high-quality companies with long track records of distributing earnings to shareholders through dividends. The portfolio is selected from a universe of stocks meeting minimum criteria of paying and/or increasing dividends over the last 10 years and have market capitalizations greater than $1 billion. Also of importance is the anticipated dividend growth rate of the aggregate portfolio. The portfolio is typically comprised of approximately 49 holdings and is expected to result in low to moderate turnover. IDEA is suitable for clients primarily seeking capital appreciation, with total return from dividend income as a secondary objective.

IDEA PlusThe Increasing Dividend Equity Account (IDEA) Plus is a dividend-based equity strategy combined with a covered call option strategy on the S&P 500 Index. Approximately 75% of the portfolio is comprised of the IDEA portfolio which invests in high-quality companies that have paid and/or increased dividends over the last 10 years. The remaining 25% consists of an ETF position in the S&P 500 Index with a corresponding covered call position. The IDEA Plus portfolio is suitable for clients seeking cash flow with less volatility than the broader equity market and capital appreciation.

Value OpportunitiesThe Value Opportunities portfolio is a concentrated portfolio of businesses that range in market capitalization and have near-term (within 18 months) catalysts in which to unlock the value. The portfolio may have concentrations in both individual holdings and/or industries. It is typically comprised of 8-12 holdings and is expected to result in higher turnover of 75-100%. Value Opportunities is suitable for clients seeking an aggressive approach to generating capital appreciation.

All Cap Value is suitable for clients whose primary objective is capital appreciation and whose secondary objective is dividend income.
