 Educational Background



 


University of California

                  The University is governed by The Regents, which under Article IX, Section 9 of the California Constitution has "full powers of organization and governance" subject only to very specific areas of legislative control. The article states that "the university shall be entirely independent of all political and sectarian influence and kept free therefrom in the appointment of its Regents and in the administration of its affairs."

Board Membership
Article IX, Section 9 was drafted in 1878 after a decade of political conflict demonstrated the importance of sheltering the university from shifting political winds. The board consists of 26 members:

    18 regents are appointed by the governor for 12-year terms

    One is a student appointed by the Regents to a one-year term

    Seven are ex officio members -- the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Speaker of the Assembly, Superintendent of Public Instruction, president and vice president of the Alumni Associations of UC and the UC president. 

In addition, two faculty members -- the chair and vice chair of the Academic Council -- sit on the board as non-voting members.

Board Officers
The Governor is officially the president of the Board of Regents; however, in practice the presiding officer of the Regents is the Chairman of the Board, elected from among its body for a one-year term, beginning July 1. The current Chairman is Regent Sherry Lansing. The Vice Chairman is Regent Bruce Varner.

The Regents appoints Officers of The Regents: the General Counsel; the Chief Investment Officer; the Secretary and Chief of Staff; and the Chief Compliance and Audit Officer.

Former Regents
Here is a list of individuals who have served as Regents of the University of California: Former Regents

Committees and Meetings
The Regents operates through 10 standing committees: Compliance and Audit, Compensation, Educational Policy, Finance, Governance, Grounds and Buildings, Health Services, Investments, Long Range Planning, and Oversight of the Department of Energy Laboratories.

The Regents meets six times a year every other month in two-day meetings                




 


University of California Berkeley - Boalt Hall School of Law

                  The University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, commonly referred to as Berkeley Law and Boalt Hall, is one of 14 schools and colleges at the University of California, Berkeley. Berkeley Law is consistently ranked as one of the top law schools in the nation, with acceptance rates lower than every school except Yale and Stanford. The Department of Jurisprudence was founded at Berkeley in 1894. In 1912, the department was renamed the School of Jurisprudence, which was then renamed the School of Law in 1950.

The School was originally located in the center of the main UC Berkeley campus in the Boalt Memorial Hall of Law, built in 1911 with funds largely from Elizabeth Josselyn Boalt donated in memory of her late husband, John Henry Boalt. In 1951, the School moved to its current location in the new Boalt Hall, at the southeast corner of the campus, and the old Boalt Hall was renamed Durant Hall.

In April 2008, the law school rebranded itself from "Boalt Hall" to "Berkeley Law", in order to more closely tie the law school's name with the campus upon which it resides. The administration hopes that this move will further increase the law school's prestige, since people will now associate it with the Berkeley campus.
