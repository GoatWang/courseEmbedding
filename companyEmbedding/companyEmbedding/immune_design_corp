Immuno-oncology Pipeline


CMB305
Antigen-specific prime boost
 
Targeting Soft Tissue Sarcoma and other NY-ESO-1 tumors




CMB305
Antigen-specific prime boost

Prime-Boost Immuno-Oncology Agent
In vivo T cell activation
Combines two agents designed to target NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors via different mechanisms

About CMB305: CMB305 is a prime-boost approach designed to target tumors that express the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, such as soft tissue sarcoma, the lead indication we are studying in Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. NY-ESO-1 is expressed in a large number of solid and liquid tumors in varying degrees. CMB305 consists of a “prime” called LV305 from our ZVex platform dosed sequentially with a “boost” called from our GLAAS platform. Together, they are designed to induce a synergistic anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response targeting NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors. CMB305 may also generate memory CTLs, and therefore long-term immune surveillance, as well as enhance other immune anti-tumor mechanisms.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma Opportunity: in both our monotherapy single arm Phase 1 and combination randomized Phase 2 studies, we are focusing on two types of sarcoma where we believe there is significant unmet need: synovial sarcoma and Myxoid round cell liposarcoma. Synovial sarcoma is a cancer in the joints with a five-year and ten-year survival for people with Grade 3 tumors or metastatic disease of less than 25% and 15%, respectively, and Myxoid round cell liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that most often occurs in the deep-seated soft tissues of the extremities. Currently marketed treatments have high toxicity, with up to 37% of patients experiencing Grade 3/4 Adverse Events. By comparison, to date, both CMB305 and LV305 have a very favorable safety profile in Sarcoma patients. We believe CMB305’s potential benefit to patients will be the combination of a favorable safety profile with improved survival, and as such are focused on overall survival and safety as the primary endpoints of these studies.
Status: CMB305 is currently in several stages of clinical development, including a monotherapy Phase 1 trial and a fully-enrolled randomized Phase 2 trial, primarilyin patients with two subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma). In the combination study, patients receive either CMB305 combined with Genentech’s cancer immunotherapy, TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab, anti-PD-L1), or atezolizumab alone, pursuant to a collaboration with Genentech.
At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2017 Annual Meeting, we reported positive clinical and biomarker data for CMB305 monotherapy. In 25 soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients with recurrent disease treated with CMB305, median overall survival (mOS) had still not yet been reached, with an overall survival rate at 12 and 18 months of 83% and 76%, respectively. These data compare favorably to mOS for approved second line and later sarcoma agents, which is only 12.4-13.5 months, as well as a published mOS of 11.7 months for synovial sarcoma patients specifically; the largest patient population enrolled in this trial. A disease control rate (DCR) of 64% (16/25) was observed, including durable tumor growth arrest in patients who had evidence of disease progression at study entry. Also, CMB305 was well tolerated, and generated a strong and broad anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response in >50% of the patients, including evidence of antigen spreading – the induction of an immune response against other tumor antigens not targeted by CMB305. In addition, we presented data showing a statistically-significant association of an induced response and clinical benefit in a pooled set of patients treated with CMB305 or LV305. The immune biomarkers studied, including novel bio-markers derived from public TCRS (pTCRs), may guide regulatory strategy via the selection of patients more likely to have survival benefit on CMB305 therapy benchmarks. (See Presentations)
We have received Orphan Drug Designation in STS for both components of CMB305 in both the US and EU, and for CMB305 in the US. If the ongoing trials produce a sufficiently robust clinical benefit for patients, we plan to pursue soft tissue sarcoma as the first indication for which we intend to seek regulatory approval for CMB305. Please check the clinical trials page for more information.







G100
Potent Intratumoral TLR4 agonism
 
 Leverages Endogenous & Neo Antigens Follicular Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma




G100
Potent Intratumoral TLR4 agonism

Intratumoral immune activation of the tumor microenvironment
Designed to leverage endogenous antigens and create a systemic immune response
Generated from GLAAS®
 discovery platform

About G100: G100 is Immune Design’s first product candidate solely generated from the GLAAS® platform and is designed to leverage the range of endogenous antigens (including neoantigens) found in the tumor microenvironment to create a systemic anti-tumor immune response from local injection. At its core, G100 consists of Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA), a potent small synthetic molecule that selectively binds to the Toll-like Receptor-4 (TLR4) receptor. We believe that when G100 is administered with mechanisms that kill, or lyse, tumor cells (such as radiation), it may cause dendritic cells near the lysed tumor to activate and capture the wide range of released endogenous tumor antigens. G100 is designed to trigger a broad immune response against those newly-encountered antigens.
Status: G100 is being studied in a fully-enrolled randomized Phase 2 trial in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (FL) in combination with local radiation and Merck’s anti-PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab, pursuant to a clinical collaboration with Merck. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2017 Annual Meeting, we presented monotherapy data of nine patients who received G100 with radiation (no pembrolizumab) that showed 100% DCR rate, with 44% of the patients achieved a partial response (PR) based on WHO criteria, which requires at least a 50% tumor reduction to qualify as a PR. In addition, 50% of evaluable patients experienced shrinkage of untreated distal (abscopal) lesion. G100 was well tolerated, with no related Grade 3/4 AEs in all three dose levels tested, and tumor biopsies showed increased inflammatory responses and T cell infiltrates in abscopal, non-treated tumors. (See Presentations)
We have received Orphan Drug Designation in follicular FL for G100 in the US. If the ongoing trial in FL patients produces a sufficiently robust clinical benefit for patients, we may pursue FL as the first indication for which we intend to seek regulatory approval for G100. In addition, the accessibility of certain tumors makes them ideal for intratumoral dosing, and we plan to evaluate the potential of additional clinical studies in other tumors. Please check the clinical trials page for more information.







LA51
Next-generation ZVex®
 
Targeting multiple conserved and/or patient-specific Neo-antigens




LA51
Next-generation ZVex®

Novel, multi-payload dendritic cell targeting vector
In vivo T cell active immunotherapy
Designed to target multiple conserved antigens without antigen competition, as well as patient-specific neoantigens, with immunostimulatory molecules
Will be generated from the evolution of the ZVex discovery platform

About LA51: We intend LA51 and our other potential next-generation approaches to go beyond the current ZVex platform, with the ability to deliver multiple antigens without the risk of antigen competition, as well as immunostimulatory molecules. In addition to conserved antigens, these next-gen ZVex agents will be designed to produce personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapies, as well. In contrast to other approaches, we believe the new payload payload capacity and ability to induce a broad immune response will enable us to include a wide range of patient-specific epitopes, thereby addressing the shortcoming of other approaches that require a more narrow selection due to finite vector space and/or antigenic competition.
Status: We plan to designate the first next-gen product candidate, LA51, in 2017.

Merkel cell carcinoma 

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cancer associated with a polyomavirus and UV exposure. The reported incidence of MCC has almost tripled in the past 20 years due, in part, to improved diagnosis and an aging patient population with extensive sun exposure. The majority of patients present with localized disease in the skin, although the disease can readily spread to regional and distant sites. Researchers have demonstrated the importance of immune dysfunction in MCC, and that MCC establishes an immune suppressive local environment in order to thrive.

Immunotherapy Reach







Pipeline
Advancing first-in-class immunotherapy product candidates in oncology, as well as infectious and allergic diseases.






Science
Next-generation, productive ZVex® and GLAAS™ discovery engines are the source of multiple product candidates across several therapeutic areas.
Immuno-oncology
We leverage our cutting-edge platforms to produce product candidates and utilize distinct therapeutic approaches that, we believe, address the shortcomings of existing therapies and have the potential to treat a broad patient population either as individual therapies or in combination with other mechanisms of action. Our two primary product candidates, CMB305 and G100, are currently in multiple Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials.
Read More
Infectious and allergic DISEASES
ZVex® and GLAAS™ -based products have potential therapeutic utility outside of oncology, as well, and provide an opportunity for an innovative approach to develop improved therapeutics. We have been successfully executing a strategy to partner individual indications outside of oncology in infectious and allergic diseases, which provide potential downstream economics while preserving growth opportunity in the future.

Immuno-oncology Pipeline


CMB305
Antigen-specific prime boost
 
Targeting Soft Tissue Sarcoma and other NY-ESO-1 tumors




CMB305
Antigen-specific prime boost

Prime-Boost Immuno-Oncology Agent
In vivo T cell activation
Combines two agents designed to target NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors via different mechanisms

About CMB305: CMB305 is a prime-boost approach designed to target tumors that express the NY-ESO-1 tumor antigen, such as soft tissue sarcoma, the lead indication we are studying in Phase 1 and 2 clinical studies. NY-ESO-1 is expressed in a large number of solid and liquid tumors in varying degrees. CMB305 consists of a “prime” called LV305 from our ZVex platform dosed sequentially with a “boost” called from our GLAAS platform. Together, they are designed to induce a synergistic anti-tumor cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response targeting NY-ESO-1-expressing tumors. CMB305 may also generate memory CTLs, and therefore long-term immune surveillance, as well as enhance other immune anti-tumor mechanisms.
Soft Tissue Sarcoma Opportunity: in both our monotherapy single arm Phase 1 and combination randomized Phase 2 studies, we are focusing on two types of sarcoma where we believe there is significant unmet need: synovial sarcoma and Myxoid round cell liposarcoma. Synovial sarcoma is a cancer in the joints with a five-year and ten-year survival for people with Grade 3 tumors or metastatic disease of less than 25% and 15%, respectively, and Myxoid round cell liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that most often occurs in the deep-seated soft tissues of the extremities. Currently marketed treatments have high toxicity, with up to 37% of patients experiencing Grade 3/4 Adverse Events. By comparison, to date, both CMB305 and LV305 have a very favorable safety profile in Sarcoma patients. We believe CMB305’s potential benefit to patients will be the combination of a favorable safety profile with improved survival, and as such are focused on overall survival and safety as the primary endpoints of these studies.
Status: CMB305 is currently in several stages of clinical development, including a monotherapy Phase 1 trial and a fully-enrolled randomized Phase 2 trial, primarilyin patients with two subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (synovial sarcoma or myxoid/round-cell liposarcoma). In the combination study, patients receive either CMB305 combined with Genentech’s cancer immunotherapy, TECENTRIQ® (atezolizumab, anti-PD-L1), or atezolizumab alone, pursuant to a collaboration with Genentech.
At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2017 Annual Meeting, we reported positive clinical and biomarker data for CMB305 monotherapy. In 25 soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients with recurrent disease treated with CMB305, median overall survival (mOS) had still not yet been reached, with an overall survival rate at 12 and 18 months of 83% and 76%, respectively. These data compare favorably to mOS for approved second line and later sarcoma agents, which is only 12.4-13.5 months, as well as a published mOS of 11.7 months for synovial sarcoma patients specifically; the largest patient population enrolled in this trial. A disease control rate (DCR) of 64% (16/25) was observed, including durable tumor growth arrest in patients who had evidence of disease progression at study entry. Also, CMB305 was well tolerated, and generated a strong and broad anti-NY-ESO-1 immune response in >50% of the patients, including evidence of antigen spreading – the induction of an immune response against other tumor antigens not targeted by CMB305. In addition, we presented data showing a statistically-significant association of an induced response and clinical benefit in a pooled set of patients treated with CMB305 or LV305. The immune biomarkers studied, including novel bio-markers derived from public TCRS (pTCRs), may guide regulatory strategy via the selection of patients more likely to have survival benefit on CMB305 therapy benchmarks. (See Presentations)
We have received Orphan Drug Designation in STS for both components of CMB305 in both the US and EU, and for CMB305 in the US. If the ongoing trials produce a sufficiently robust clinical benefit for patients, we plan to pursue soft tissue sarcoma as the first indication for which we intend to seek regulatory approval for CMB305. Please check the clinical trials page for more information.







G100
Potent Intratumoral TLR4 agonism
 
 Leverages Endogenous & Neo Antigens Follicular Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma




G100
Potent Intratumoral TLR4 agonism

Intratumoral immune activation of the tumor microenvironment
Designed to leverage endogenous antigens and create a systemic immune response
Generated from GLAAS®
 discovery platform

About G100: G100 is Immune Design’s first product candidate solely generated from the GLAAS® platform and is designed to leverage the range of endogenous antigens (including neoantigens) found in the tumor microenvironment to create a systemic anti-tumor immune response from local injection. At its core, G100 consists of Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA), a potent small synthetic molecule that selectively binds to the Toll-like Receptor-4 (TLR4) receptor. We believe that when G100 is administered with mechanisms that kill, or lyse, tumor cells (such as radiation), it may cause dendritic cells near the lysed tumor to activate and capture the wide range of released endogenous tumor antigens. G100 is designed to trigger a broad immune response against those newly-encountered antigens.
Status: G100 is being studied in a fully-enrolled randomized Phase 2 trial in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (FL) in combination with local radiation and Merck’s anti-PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab, pursuant to a clinical collaboration with Merck. At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2017 Annual Meeting, we presented monotherapy data of nine patients who received G100 with radiation (no pembrolizumab) that showed 100% DCR rate, with 44% of the patients achieved a partial response (PR) based on WHO criteria, which requires at least a 50% tumor reduction to qualify as a PR. In addition, 50% of evaluable patients experienced shrinkage of untreated distal (abscopal) lesion. G100 was well tolerated, with no related Grade 3/4 AEs in all three dose levels tested, and tumor biopsies showed increased inflammatory responses and T cell infiltrates in abscopal, non-treated tumors. (See Presentations)
We have received Orphan Drug Designation in follicular FL for G100 in the US. If the ongoing trial in FL patients produces a sufficiently robust clinical benefit for patients, we may pursue FL as the first indication for which we intend to seek regulatory approval for G100. In addition, the accessibility of certain tumors makes them ideal for intratumoral dosing, and we plan to evaluate the potential of additional clinical studies in other tumors. Please check the clinical trials page for more information.







LA51
Next-generation ZVex®
 
Targeting multiple conserved and/or patient-specific Neo-antigens




LA51
Next-generation ZVex®

Novel, multi-payload dendritic cell targeting vector
In vivo T cell active immunotherapy
Designed to target multiple conserved antigens without antigen competition, as well as patient-specific neoantigens, with immunostimulatory molecules
Will be generated from the evolution of the ZVex discovery platform

About LA51: We intend LA51 and our other potential next-generation approaches to go beyond the current ZVex platform, with the ability to deliver multiple antigens without the risk of antigen competition, as well as immunostimulatory molecules. In addition to conserved antigens, these next-gen ZVex agents will be designed to produce personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapies, as well. In contrast to other approaches, we believe the new payload payload capacity and ability to induce a broad immune response will enable us to include a wide range of patient-specific epitopes, thereby addressing the shortcoming of other approaches that require a more narrow selection due to finite vector space and/or antigenic competition.
Status: We plan to designate the first next-gen product candidate, LA51, in 2017.

Merkel cell carcinoma 

Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare and aggressive cancer associated with a polyomavirus and UV exposure. The reported incidence of MCC has almost tripled in the past 20 years due, in part, to improved diagnosis and an aging patient population with extensive sun exposure. The majority of patients present with localized disease in the skin, although the disease can readily spread to regional and distant sites. Researchers have demonstrated the importance of immune dysfunction in MCC, and that MCC establishes an immune suppressive local environment in order to thrive.

Overview of Product Design and Development Services
Whether you are a first-time inventor, a small start-up or an established company, Enhance can complement your business by delivering inspirational product design and development that will drive your bottom line.
 
 
 




Industrial Design
Taking an invention or product concept into reality is a core concern of our industrial design services.  Our mission is to optimize function, value and appearance for the mutual benefit of the product user and the manufacturer.  This means we seek to design both an aesthetically pleasing product, but also one that is commercially feasible.
 
 
 



Engineering and Prototyping
Getting samples for presentations or proof of concept is a crucial step to test how a product will function, as well as survey interest from potential customers or licensees. Enhance has the capabilities of making you a part through the use of the best technologies in rapid prototyping, from fused deposition modeling (FDM), stereolithography (SLA), and more.
 
 
 



Manufacturing Sourcing
Finding a source to manufacture a quality product at low prices and with reasonable terms is one of the most challenging aspects to commercializing a product. Sourcing is of utmost strategic importance and can make or break a product’s success. Enhance can help you navigate the complicated maze of locating and working with a factory overseas or in the US.
 
 
 
 




Marketing
From professionally designed sell sheets to product animation demonstrations or even full video production, Enhance can prepare the materials to make an impact in your presentation. From retailers to customers, licensees to investors, our work will give your product a professional appearance that will capture attention.
 
 
 



Licensing
Licensing your invention idea involves collaborating with companies well positioned to commercialize your product and pay a royalty. Enhance can leverage the product development to tailor a design package that attracts companies who will license your invention and pay you royalties.
 
 
 



Patents
Patent searches provide inventors with critical industry information and Provisional Patent Applications can be the first step to protecting your invention. Enhance has a streamlined and professional process that utilizes a registered patent attorney.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Harnessing the Immune System to Fight Disease

AboutImmune Design 



We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company with next-generation in vivo approaches designed to enable the body’s immune system to fight disease. Although we believe our approaches have broad potential across multiple therapeutic areas, we are focused in oncology and have engineered our technologies to activate the immune system’s natural ability to create tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells, or CTLs, to fight cancer. Our two primary product candidates, CMB305 and G100, utilize distinct immuno-oncology approaches that, we believe, address the shortcomings of existing therapies and have the potential to treat a broad patient population either as individual therapies or in combination with other mechanisms of action.
Our immuno-oncology product candidates are being developed in two separate approaches: one that targets specific antigens and/or epitopes (such as CMB305 and in our neoantigen collaboration); and an alternative approach that leverages the endogenous antigens found in the tumor microenvironment via intratumoral immunization (such as G100). The specific antigen approach uses selected antigens that are also present in the patient’s tumor so that the immune system will be educated to recognize the tumor antigen and kill tumor cells expressing the antigen. The intratumoral immunization approach, in contrast, does not require pre-identifying a selected antigen present in the tumor. It instead relies on treatments such as chemotherapy or local radiation to lyse tumors and release endogenous antigens, which are then captured by neighboring G100-activated dendritic cells, and is intended to generate a broad and varied immune response. Although they have distinct mechanisms of action, we designed both CMB305 and G100 to convert “cold” tumors, or those without CTLs, to “hot” tumors, or those with CTLs specific for the antigens expressed by the tumor.
While our primary focus is immuno-oncology, we believe that our platforms also have therapeutic potential in infectious and allergic diseases, and have multiple collaborations in place with global pharmaceutical companies leveraging the GLAAS platform. We look to our partnerships to provide potential downstream economics while preserving growth opportunities in the future.

Prospect Profile: Immune Design Corp. | PharmSource

Prospect Profile: Immune Design Corp.
by Ryan Worthen
Prospect Profile highlights a newly funded bio/pharmaceutical company. This includes important insights into the featured company’s product pipeline, manufacturing and business relationships, and likely sourcing opportunities.
Immune Design Corp. is a U.S. public pharmaceutical company that develops therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of infectious and malignant disease. As reported in the July 31, 2014 issue of the PharmSource Lead Sheet, Immune Design raised $60 million in the completion of an IPO.
Corporate Highlights

Immune Design Corp. was incorporated in Delaware in February 2008.
Corporate Headquarters: Seattle, Washington – 11,000 square feet of office and laboratory space.
Facility: South San Francisco, CA – 2,058 square feet of office space.
As of June 19, 2014, Immune Design had 27 employees.

Sourcing Opportunities

Immune Design plans to use the proceeds to fund Phase II trials of CMB305, including completion of a randomized trial in a high-incidence tumor and an exploratory trial comparing LV305 and CMB305 in the same tumor types; to fund an additional Phase I trial of G100 in a second indication; and for working capital and general corporate purposes, including potential future development programs, early-stage R&D and continued development of the DCVex and GLAAS platform technologies.
The company has no internal manufacturing capabilities and relies on third-party manufacturers to produce bulk drug substance and formulated drug products as well as fill/finish required for clinical trials. The company plans to continue to rely upon CMOs to manufacture commercial quantities of product candidates.
Immune Design does not have a long-term commercial supply arrangement in place with any contract manufacturers at this time.
The company relies on CROs to conduct all clinical trials.
Immune design has no internal sales or marketing capability and may rely on alliances with others possessing such capabilities to commercialize its products.

Business Relationships

In October 2010, Immune Design entered into three separate license agreements with MedImmune pursuant to which the company granted MedImmune a worldwide, sub-licensable, exclusive license to use Immune Design’s Glucopyranosyl Lipid Adjuvant (GLA) technology, which has activity as a TLR4 agonist, and to develop and sell vaccines in three different infectious disease indications. Under the license agreements, MedImmune is obligated to develop and obtain regulatory approval for a licensed product in certain markets, and to market and sell licensed products in any country where it obtains regulatory approval.
In October 2011, Immune Design and Sanofi entered into an early-stage research collaboration to investigate the biological and immunological properties of GLA in vitro and in allergy disease models. Sanofi may select lead candidates for further development.
In May 2013, Immune Design entered into a nonexclusive license agreement granting Medicago a right to research, develop, and commercialize GLA in the field of pandemic influenza. Medicago paid an upfront payment of $0.5 million and is obligated to make up to $9.5 million in milestone payments.
