About Us

Celadon, Inc. is a group of highly skilled engineers who are focused on pushing towards the development and execution of new medical imaging systems. In 2009, the Celadon group began its exploration into the use of electromagnetics to produce healthcare diagnostic images when it was established as the Independent Research and Development (IR&D) division of Ellumen, Inc., a certified small business headquartered in Arlington, VA. Ellumen’s history and roots are well established in both the commercial and federal healthcare sectors which has enabled it to leverage a variety of existing IT and engineering expertise, including extensive experience with system design, development, medical imaging techniques and algorithms, and management of large scale healthcare environments. This industry leading expertise coupled with a lack of creative solutions in the healthcare imaging field directly led to the formation of the Celadon IR&D division.  
The Celadon IR&D division has been specifically tasked by the Ellumen executive board with developing microwave imaging systems which utilize electromagnetics in order to generate high-quality internal images of both organic and inorganic bodies. Over the years, Celadon has since expanded its research efforts into complementary areas including antenna design, high performance computing (HPC), parallel computations, vacuum electronics, microwave and millimeter-wave circuits, and computational intelligence with the goal of developing products and technologies that improve the current imaging capabilities of clinicians while minimizing the risk of harm to patients.

Executives in the department are in charge of telecommunications, network administration, systems operations, and implementation of IT projects.

The company's TruckersB2B program, which provides services to smaller trucking companies, has its own IT operations. 

Celadon's IT group maintains partnerships with ALK Technologies (maker of the PC*Miller trucking and logistics software) and Manhattan Associates.

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
Celadon cofounders Stephen Russell and Leonard Bennett had neither employees nor equipment when they started the Indiana-based company, but they did have one major contract to transport automotive parts to a new Chrysler plant in Mexico. Russell and Bennett named their new company Celadon after reading about celadon pottery, an ancient green-glazed stoneware dating back to the Koryo dynasty (918-1392 A.D.). They hoped their company would be distinctive like the pottery. Celadon did $8 million in business during its first year and was considered a pioneer of the commerce trail between the United States and Mexico.
NAFTA[edit]
The passing of the National American Free Trade Act in 1995 was a major break for Celadon, which was in a position to capitalize on the explosion in trade between the United States and Mexico. According to the original NAFTA, trucks from Mexico could enter the United States and move freely within the states bordering Mexico, and even as far north as the California-Oregon border. However, the United States blocked NAFTA just as it was about to go into effect. While the United States contended it had "safety concerns," critics claimed the move was politically connected to the powerful Teamsters Union, which worried that allowing low-paid Mexican truck drivers into the country would threaten U.S. jobs. NAFTA was eventually passed, but drivers were prohibited from hauling their loads to their Mexican destinations. Instead, they had to hand off their loads at border-town interchange points, and Mexican truck drivers took over for the final leg of the run.
Celadon quickly adapted to NAFTA's provisions. It cultivated its relationships with over 15 Mexican trucking companies and allowed these companies to drive its trucks to their destinations within Mexico. Many in the industry feared Celadon's trucks would be confiscated in Mexico, but Celadon hauled shipment after shipment without incident. It credited its solid relationships with the Mexican trucking companies for its success. Celadon became known as the primary NAFTA carrier. The company later acquired the Mexican trucking company Transportacion de Jaguar to assist with cargo transfer at the Mexican border.
Privatization Attempt[edit]
After several years of answering to the public, Russell considered the IPO a mistake for Celadon. "Being a private company, you can focus on the long term without worrying about specific quarterly earnings," he explained in the Indiana Business Journal in 1998. Russell also felt Celadon's stock was "unappreciated" on Wall Street. In 1998, Larendo Acquisition Company, a subsidiary of the New York Investment firm Odyssey, planned to acquire Celadon for $259 million, but backed out because it was unable to secure financing. News of the deal falling through caused a 32 percent drop in Celadon's stock.

Celadon Group, Inc. is a truckload shipping company located in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. It is one of the ten largest truckload carriers in North America. Celadon was founded in 1985 and employs over 4,000 individuals. Through its subsidiaries, Celadon provides long-haul and regional freight service across Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
Celadon cofounders Stephen Russell and Leonard Bennett had neither employees nor equipment when they started the Indiana-based company, but they did have one major contract to transport automotive parts to a new Chrysler plant in Mexico. Russell and Bennett named their new company Celadon after reading about celadon pottery, an ancient green-glazed stoneware dating back to the Koryo dynasty (918-1392 A.D.). They hoped their company would be distinctive like the pottery. Celadon did $8 million in business during its first year and was considered a pioneer of the commerce trail between the United States and Mexico.
NAFTA[edit]
The passing of the National American Free Trade Act in 1995 was a major break for Celadon, which was in a position to capitalize on the explosion in trade between the United States and Mexico. According to the original NAFTA, trucks from Mexico could enter the United States and move freely within the states bordering Mexico, and even as far north as the California-Oregon border. However, the United States blocked NAFTA just as it was about to go into effect. While the United States contended it had "safety concerns," critics claimed the move was politically connected to the powerful Teamsters Union, which worried that allowing low-paid Mexican truck drivers into the country would threaten U.S. jobs. NAFTA was eventually passed, but drivers were prohibited from hauling their loads to their Mexican destinations. Instead, they had to hand off their loads at border-town interchange points, and Mexican truck drivers took over for the final leg of the run.
Celadon quickly adapted to NAFTA's provisions. It cultivated its relationships with over 15 Mexican trucking companies and allowed these companies to drive its trucks to their destinations within Mexico. Many in the industry feared Celadon's trucks would be confiscated in Mexico, but Celadon hauled shipment after shipment without incident. It credited its solid relationships with the Mexican trucking companies for its success. Celadon became known as the primary NAFTA carrier. The company later acquired the Mexican trucking company Transportacion de Jaguar to assist with cargo transfer at the Mexican border.
Privatization Attempt[edit]
After several years of answering to the public, Russell considered the IPO a mistake for Celadon. "Being a private company, you can focus on the long term without worrying about specific quarterly earnings," he explained in the Indiana Business Journal in 1998. Russell also felt Celadon's stock was "unappreciated" on Wall Street. In 1998, Larendo Acquisition Company, a subsidiary of the New York Investment firm Odyssey, planned to acquire Celadon for $259 million, but backed out because it was unable to secure financing. News of the deal falling through caused a 32 percent drop in Celadon's stock.

Celadon Group, Inc. is a truckload shipping company located in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. It is one of the ten largest truckload carriers in North America. Celadon was founded in 1985 and employs over 4,000 individuals. Through its subsidiaries, Celadon provides long-haul and regional freight service across Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

History[edit]
Beginnings[edit]
Celadon cofounders Stephen Russell and Leonard Bennett had neither employees nor equipment when they started the Indiana-based company, but they did have one major contract to transport automotive parts to a new Chrysler plant in Mexico. Russell and Bennett named their new company Celadon after reading about celadon pottery, an ancient green-glazed stoneware dating back to the Koryo dynasty (918-1392 A.D.). They hoped their company would be distinctive like the pottery. Celadon did $8 million in business during its first year and was considered a pioneer of the commerce trail between the United States and Mexico.
NAFTA[edit]
The passing of the National American Free Trade Act in 1995 was a major break for Celadon, which was in a position to capitalize on the explosion in trade between the United States and Mexico. According to the original NAFTA, trucks from Mexico could enter the United States and move freely within the states bordering Mexico, and even as far north as the California-Oregon border. However, the United States blocked NAFTA just as it was about to go into effect. While the United States contended it had "safety concerns," critics claimed the move was politically connected to the powerful Teamsters Union, which worried that allowing low-paid Mexican truck drivers into the country would threaten U.S. jobs. NAFTA was eventually passed, but drivers were prohibited from hauling their loads to their Mexican destinations. Instead, they had to hand off their loads at border-town interchange points, and Mexican truck drivers took over for the final leg of the run.
Celadon quickly adapted to NAFTA's provisions. It cultivated its relationships with over 15 Mexican trucking companies and allowed these companies to drive its trucks to their destinations within Mexico. Many in the industry feared Celadon's trucks would be confiscated in Mexico, but Celadon hauled shipment after shipment without incident. It credited its solid relationships with the Mexican trucking companies for its success. Celadon became known as the primary NAFTA carrier. The company later acquired the Mexican trucking company Transportacion de Jaguar to assist with cargo transfer at the Mexican border.
Privatization Attempt[edit]
After several years of answering to the public, Russell considered the IPO a mistake for Celadon. "Being a private company, you can focus on the long term without worrying about specific quarterly earnings," he explained in the Indiana Business Journal in 1998. Russell also felt Celadon's stock was "unappreciated" on Wall Street. In 1998, Larendo Acquisition Company, a subsidiary of the New York Investment firm Odyssey, planned to acquire Celadon for $259 million, but backed out because it was unable to secure financing. News of the deal falling through caused a 32 percent drop in Celadon's stock.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
