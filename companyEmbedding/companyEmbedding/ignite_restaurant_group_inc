	Headquartered in Houston, TX, Ignite Restaurant Group, Inc. owns and operates two restaurant brands: Joe's Crab Shack and Brick House Tavern + Tap. Each brand offers a variety of high-quality, chef-inspired food and beverages in distinctive, casual, high-energy atmosphere. The Ignite brands provide guests with memorable, matchless dining experiences.

	Founded in 1991, Joe's Crab Shack is an established, national chain of casual seafood restaurants. The menu offers a variety of unique, high quality seafood items, with an emphasis on crab and Southern flavors. Joe's is a fun, family-friendly restaurant that encourages guests to "strap on a bib, order your favorite bucket of crab or steampot, and unwind & enjoy with the best of them." Unique steampots and buckets of crab combined with signature cocktails like the Shark Bite and Category 5 Hurricane are a few of the most popular items on the innovative and "crabcentric" menu. The guests at Joe's create lasting memories dining on picnic tables located on outdoor patios, many of which are equipped with playgrounds.

	Brick House Tavern + Tap, founded in 2008, is a polished casual restaurant brand focused on elevated American fare prepared fresh by our executive chefs. Brick House is ahead of the curve in innovative menu and beverage development, featuring over 70 varieties of beer. Several local & craft selections provide guests a truly differentiated spin on a "gastro pub". The contemporary interior features unique seating and dining with 360 degree TV viewing for sports enthusiasts. Brick House strikes a balance between providing guests with an elevated experience while providing personalized hospitality. Brick House was recently listed as the #1 "up and comer" full-service, varied-menu restaurant business by Technomic, a leading restaurant industry consulting and research firm, and a top ten Breakout Brand from Nation's Restaurant News.

                Ignite Restaurant Group enters Chapter 11 with bidder lined up
            



                Kelly Investment Group affiliate offers $50 million for chain
            



Ignite Restaurant Group Inc., the operator of the Joe’s Crab Shack and Brick House Tavern & Tap chains, filed for bankruptcy with an eye toward a possible sale to an affiliate of Kelly Investment Group.Ignite has seen sales decline as the U.S. dining sector faces drops in customer traffic. The company listed estimated total debts as of April 30 of  $197.3 million in Chapter 11 papers filed Tuesday in Houston federal court. Assets totaled $153.4 million.Ignite announced in April that Robert S. Merritt had resigned as chief executive officer and left the board. Jonathan Tibus, a managing director at turnaround firm Alvarez & Marsal, was chosen to replace him.








“The debtors have continued to experience declining financial performance and declines in comparable restaurant sales and income from operations at Joe’s and Brick House,” Tibus said in a court filing. “The debtors have closed underperforming restaurants and implemented cost reduction measures to help mitigate the effect of these declines and improve their financial position and liquidity.”Ignite began looking around for a buyer last year, but as its condition deteriorated, viable offers dried up. In June, Ignite lined up Kelly affiliate KRG Acquisitions Co. as a “stalking horse” to open bidding in a court-supervised auction. KRG’s offer consists of $50 million and assumption of liabilities.Industry WoesThe broader U.S. restaurant industry is suffering headwinds on multiple fronts. Eateries are relying more heavily on discounts and specials to attract diners, crimping profit margins. And a historic bout of food deflation has turned grocery stores into a bigger bargain. That’s made consumers more likely to eat meals at home.




Chain restaurants also are losing market share to mom-and-pop places -- a shift for the industry. Sales for independent restaurants are expected to grow about 5 percent through 2020, while chains will climb just 3 percent, according to Pentallect Inc., a research firm in Chicago.Ignite operates 137 Joe’s and Brick House restaurants in 32 states, with “large numbers” in Texas, Florida and California, plus three franchises in the United Arab Emirates, according to court papers. It employs 8,400 people, including 5,500 part-time workers. The first Joe’s opened in Houston in 1991.




The case is In re Ignite Restaurant Group Inc., 17-33550, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston).— With assistance by Lauren Coleman-Lochner, and Leslie Patton

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
