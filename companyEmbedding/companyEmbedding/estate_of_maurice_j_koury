In brief
29 UNC students study abroad on scholarships
Carolina awarded more than $74,000 in privately funded, need- and merit-based scholarships to 29 undergraduates for study abroad during spring 2008 semester.
Recipients represent majors including environmental science, German, history, business administration and Latin American studies. They studied in cities around the world, including Havana, Cuba; Barcelona, Spain; Wollongong, Australia; Cochabamba, Bolivia; and Prague, Czech Republic. The UNC Study Abroad Office in the College of Arts and Sciences offers more than 320 study abroad programs in more than 70 countries. Approximately 1,200 Carolina undergraduates go abroad each year.
“We were excited to offer new scholarship opportunities this [past spring] semester, made possible by the generosity of Carolina alumni,” said Bob Miles, associate dean for study abroad and international exchanges in the college. “Increasing the amount of financial assistance available to our students is even more important now, given the weakness of the U.S. dollar, increases in the cost of airfare and other factors that are raising the cost of studying abroad.”
The scholarships awarded for spring programs are supported by 12 endowment funds established by private donors. Visit giving.unc.edu/news/2008/abroad.htm to view a list of donors and funds created.
Kenan Charitable Trust gives $250,000 to PlayMakers
The William R. Kenan Jr. Charitable Trust of Chapel Hill has donated $250,000 to UNC’s PlayMakers RepertoryCompany to support its artistic and educational programs. The gift assists the professional theater company with expenses ranging from actors’ salaries, scenery and costumes to education and outreach programs.
“The Kenan Trust made the gift in recognition of the important contribution that PlayMakers makes to the cultural fabric of the University community,” said Richard Krasno, executive director of the William R. Kenan Jr. Charitable Trust.
PlayMakers, now in its 32nd season, generates about 40 percent of its annual operating expenses through ticket sales, making private support critical to its growth and vitality.
“We are immensely grateful to the William R. Kenan Jr. Charitable Trust for its commitment to our mission and our work,” said Joseph Haj, PlayMakers’ producing artistic director. “The trust’s belief in our efforts to bring PlayMakers ever closer to the University and to the community at large is deeply empowering, and I am proud to have their faith in our efforts.”
Mellon Foundation funds interdisciplinary civil rights scholarship
A $937,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation of New York will support a new collaboration on civil rights between Carolina and the University of North Carolina Press.
The three-year grant will support “Publishing the Long Civil Rights Movement,” a project that, through print and digital publications, will underscore one of Carolina’s longstanding academic priorities: interdisciplinary civil rights scholarship. Principal investigators are Kate Douglas Torrey, director of the UNC Press; Jacquelyn Dowd Hall, director of the Southern Oral History Program in the Center for the Study of the American South; Julius Chambers, director of the Center for Civil Rights in the School of Law; and Richard Szary, associate university librarian for special collections.
The grant is part of a Mellon Foundation program intended to advance humanistic scholarship by developing new ways of connecting the publishing activities of university presses with the academic priorities of their universities.
Carolina Women’s Leadership Council honors two UNC faculty for mentoring
The Carolina Women’s Leadership Council on Feb. 29 honored UNC professors Jane Brown and Jo Anne Earp with the Faculty Mentoring Award. The award includes a $5,000 stipend and recognizes the significant efforts of faculty to guide, mentor and lead students or junior faculty members as they make career decisions, embark on research challenges and enrich their lives through public service, teaching and educational opportunities.
Brown, the James L. Knight Professor at the School of Journalism and Mass Communication, received the award for faculty-to-faculty mentoring. One nominator said of Brown that she has the “rare quality of really caring about junior faculty, being inclusive in her interactions with students and faculty, and providing sound advice and guidance.” Earp, a professor of health behavior and health education at the School of Public Health, received the award for faculty-to-student mentoring. One nominator deemed Earp an individual who “makes no distinction in people’s rank or position. Instead, what she sees is the potential in people, and then she sees it as her job to help them see—and realize—that potential as well.”
The awards are funded by an endowment established by the Carolina Women’s Leadership Council, a volunteer committee and a nationwide network of women committed to supporting the University and students’ educational experiences. Along with providing financial support, members volunteer their time and share their expertise, champion UNC in their regions and serve on boards that further the University’s mission. The Carolina Women’s Leadership Council has raised more than $260,000 to endow the mentoring awards as an effort to bolster faculty support.
UNC names residence hall in honor of Maurice Koury
UNC has renamed a south campus residence hall in honor of Burlington businessman and alumnus Maurice John Koury, one of the University’s most involved and generous contributors of both service and philanthropy. Formerly known as Ehringhaus South since its 2002 completion, the four-story, state-of–the-art building was dedicated as Maurice J. Koury Hall on April 9.
Koury Hall houses 263 students in a nearly 73,000-squarefoot space that features suite-style rooms that include two double bedrooms and a shared, semiprivate bathroom. Koury Hall is similar to three other south campus residence halls that were completed with housing revenue bonds in 2002 at a cost of $47 million, or roughly $12 million per building.
A Burlington native, born of Lebanese immigrant parents, Koury came to UNC in 1949 and joined his brother Ernest in managing Carolina Hosiery. Today, he serves as president of Carolina Hosiery Mills, Inc., and also has business interests in the development of hotels and commercial properties.
Koury has been significantly involved with and supportive of both the University’s academic and athletic pursuits. In 1987, he endowed the Edna J. Koury Distinguished Professorship in the College of Arts and Sciences as a memorial to his mother. He has donated funds for the Maurice Koury Auditorium in Kenan-Flagler Business School and has endowed funds for dental research in the School of Dentistry. Koury has given generously to support programs in the Division of Student Affairs and also made a leadership gift to the George Watts Hill Alumni Center. During his second term as president of the Educational Foundation in 1983-84, Koury led the successful fund-raising drive to finance the Dean E. Smith Center. The natatorium adjacent to the Smith Center is also named for him.
Koury served two terms on the University’s Board of Trustees, was on the Board of Visitors, and was a member of the Medical Foundation of North Carolina, Inc., which supports the School of Medicine. He also was an officer in the General Alumni Association and a member of the Morehead Scholarship Committee.
His honors from Carolina include the Distinguished Service Medal of the General Alumni Association (1994), the William Richardson Davie Award (1995) and an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree (2001).
 
Kenan Trust gift to honors will add faculty, help nearly double size of program
A $6 million gift from the William R. Kenan Jr. Charitable Trust will nearly double the number of students invited to the College of Arts and Sciences’ Honors Program.
The gift, which adds faculty to teach honors courses, qualifies for a $3 million matching grant from the North Carolina Distinguished Professors Endowment Trust, bringing the total value of the gift to $9 million. The Kenan Trust gift creates six $1 million endowments, each augmented by the state match of $500,000, and will support a minimum of six assistant or associate professors who will be designated as William R. Kenan Jr. Fellows or William R. Kenan Jr. Scholars, respectively, in the College of Arts and Sciences.
“This gift to the Honors Program reflects the desire of the Kenan Trust to pay tribute to Chancellor Moeser for the leadership he has provided to Carolina over the past eight years, and to his desire to double the number of participants in the Honors Program,” said Richard M. Krasno, executive director of the Kenan Trust. “We also want to signal our confidence in new Chancellor-elect H. Holden Thorp, who has been a tremendous champion for the Honors Program as dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.”
The $6 million gift matches private support from two recent major gifts.
In September 2007, an anonymous donor gave $5 million to fund five new professorships named for alumni Peter Thacher Grauer and William Burwell Harrison. State matching funds will add $2.5 million,  making this a $7.5 million endowment. In December 2007, the Morehead-Cain Foundation created the Mary H. Cain Distinguished Professorship in Art History, resulting in a $2 million endowment, including state match, that will add four honors courses in art history. When combined, private gifts and state matching grants from the three donors total $18.5 million in endowed support for the program.
“The Kenan Trust gift comes at a time when a deciding factor for students who choose Carolina over distinguished peer universities has been the nationally acclaimed Honors Program,” said James Leloudis, associate dean for honors. “A limited capacity to serve all qualified students has caused the program to lose hundreds of talented applicants to other schools.”
Former social worker gives $1.4 million for poverty professorship, scholarships
Retired social services worker and School of Social Work alumna Melvarene Adair has established a charitable gift annuity that directs nearly $1.4 million to the School of Social Work—one of the largest gifts in the school’s history.
The money—to be supplemented with $500,000 in state matching funds—will be used to create a $1 million endowment for The Johnson-Howard-Adair Distinguished Professorship. About $394,000 will go to an existing scholarship, which was created by Adair’s son, Kenneth Howard, in his mother’s honor.
The Howard-Johnson-Adair professorship will be among the largest professorships established at a school of social work, and the Adair Scholarships will support master of social work students in perpetuity.
Adair’s experiences in the 1950s as a young social worker in some of North Carolina’s most rural communities led her to focus the professorship towards a scholar or distinguished teacher interested “in the impact and influence of poverty on individuals, families and communities.”
At that time, Adair—who earned a master’s degree in social work from UNC in 1976—spent much of her time making home visits to determine how much financial help or “welfare” households would receive. She had not yet fully grasped the significant impact she had on the individuals’ and families’ lives with whom she worked. “I didn’t understand that these dollars meant so much more to them than they did to me,” she said as she recalled one family who cooked their meals in the fireplace over an open flame. “I didn’t understand how needy they were. I think at the time, I was thinking more about saving the taxpayers’ money. I’d be more generous today.”
Indeed, Adair has been generous and hopes her gift will ultimately help attract more students to the profession of social work. “I’ve gotten the impression that everybody wants to go into mental health because of the prestige, but I want [people] to realize that this is a good field, too,” she said.
Carolina’s School of Social Work is one of the nation’s leaders in social work research and education, and is consistently ranked among the top 10 schools of social work in the nation.
UNC alumnus creates second scholarship, honors family members
Dual Carolina graduate (B.S. ’58, J.D. ’61) Oliver W. “Al” Alphin of Durham and Surf City, N.C., has created a scholarship fund to honor his brother and sister-in-law, Reevis S. Alphin and Barbara Gilliam Alphin, both of Sanford, N.C.
The Reevis S. and Barbara Gilliam Alphin Scholarship Fund will provide need-based aid to students from Lee, Duplin or Pender counties. Reevis Alphin was born in Duplin County and is a UNC Class of 1951 graduate. He received his master’s degree from Duke University and his Ph.D. from the Medical College of Virginia. Barbara Gilliam Alphin is a native of Lee County and is a Class of 1954 graduate of the newly renamed Eshelman School of Pharmacy.
Oliver Alphin said he wanted to honor his brother and sister-in-law and the University, and help good students get a superior education. “My brother was the first in our family to attend UNC, but now [our family] has a total of 51 years at UNC and 19 degrees,” he said.
Stephen Cumbie named head of real estate development center at Kenan-Flagler
In 2007, the Leonard W. Wood Foundation for Excellence in Real Estate was established to support recruitment of faculty and a new executive director for the Center for Real Estate Development (CRED) at Kenan-Flagler Business School. In 2008, the school has named UNC alumnus Stephen M. Cumbie as executive director of CRED. Launched in 2001, CRED is part of the Frank Hawkins Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise. The center’s education, research and outreach in real estate development help business leaders create and manage property in ways that have a positive impact and sustainable results.
Cumbie is CEO of NVCommercial Incorporated, NVRetail and the Metro Realty Group, commercial real estate investment, development and services companies with projects in the Washington, D.C., and Denver metro areas.
Cumbie graduated in 1970 Phi Beta Kappa with a chemistry degree and earned an MBA in 1973. He succeeds Thomas H. Harvey III, who continues to serve as an adjunct professor of real estate developmentBRIEFS

the Shareholder Group, as now or hereinafter filed with the SEC
(“ Schedule 13D ”).

RECITALS

WHEREAS , the Parties desire to set forth certain
covenants and agreements to resolve their respective views
regarding various matters as to the Company, including the

hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

1. Board and Annual Meeting
Matters . The Parties covenant and agree that:

(a) On the date hereof, the Company
shall take all actions necessary to postpone the 2008 annual
meeting of shareholders of the Company (the “ 2008 Annual
Meeting ”).

(b) As promptly as practicable, but
no later than the first business day after the date of this
Agreement, the Board shall duly convene and hold a meeting of the

the Board, and (iii) the Board shall accept the resignations
described in Section 1(h) of each of the current

below).

(c) The newly constituted Board
(the “ New Board ”), consisting of the
Shareholder Nominees and the four incumbent directors, Walter Lee
Crouch, Jr., Becky Parker O’Daniell, Craig S. Relan and
Walter O. Winter (the “ Incumbent Nominees ”)
shall



form a special committee of the Board comprised
of two of the Shareholder Nominees and two of the Incumbent
Nominees to identify and select a ninth independent member of the
Board (the “ Selection Committee ”). The
Selection Committee shall act in good faith to select a qualified
independent director nominee (the “ Independent
Nominee ”) to serve as the ninth member of the Board as
soon as practical. The Selection Committee shall first solicit
recommendations from River Oaks Capital LLC and Banc Funds Company,
L.L.C., two of the Company’s institutional shareholders.
After receiving such recommendations, the Selection Committee may

discretion of the Selection Committee. The Selection Committee
shall give preference to residents of the state of North Carolina.
The selection of the Independent Nominee by a majority or unanimous
vote of the Selection Committee shall be final and binding on all
Parties. Upon such selection by the Selection Committee and
agreement by the Independent Nominee, the New Board shall appoint
the Independent Nominee to the Board.

(d) The New Board shall be
responsible for determining the date of the postponed 2008 Annual
Meeting and the New Board shall recommend and nominate the
Shareholder Nominees, the Incumbent Nominees and the Independent
Nominee, if one has been selected (collectively, the “
Combined Slate ”), to stand for election at the 2008
Annual Meeting.

(e) In the event that the
Independent Nominee is included in the Combined Slate to stand for
election at the 2008 Annual Meeting, the Board shall be classified
as follows: (i) Walter Lee Crouch, Jr., Becky Parker
O’Daniell and Scott C. Sullivan shall be nominated as Class I

the same individuals that comprise the Board. James S. Mahan III
shall be appointed to serve as Chairman of the Bank
Board.

(g) To the extent practicable and
consistent with Nasdaq and SEC rules, each committee of each of the
Board and the Bank Board shall have a equal number of Shareholder
Nominees and Incumbent Nominees. Neither the Board nor the Bank
Board shall form an executive committee without the approval of at
least two-thirds of their respective directors.

(h) No later than the date on which
the New Board is appointed, each of the current directors of each
of the Company and the Bank not forming a part of the Combined

service of a Continuing Shareholder Group Director for any reason
shall be filled by a nominee designated to the Board by a committee
of the Board constituted solely of the Continuing Shareholder Group

created by the cessation of service of a Continuing Incumbent
Director for any reason shall be filled by a nominee designated to

Committee, as the case may be.

(j) The Board shall nominate and

later than five (5) business days after his request for
reimbursement is made to the Company, reimburse Mr. Koury for

BURLINGTON - Maurice J. Koury, a benefactor to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a serial investor in North Carolina banks, has fired off a letter to the managers of Wilmington's Cape Fear Bank, telling them it's time to give investors an exit.
"I write to you today to express my dissatisfaction with your stewardship of Cape Fear Bank Corporation," Koury writes in the Sept. 26 letter to CEO John Cameron Coburn and other officials of the publicly traded bank.





 


In nine years, Koury says, shareholders have seen a 43 percent return on their investment, based on the bank's Sept. 14 close of $9.10 a share, even as the CEO's base salary, before bonus and options, rose by 385 percent, to $250,000.
"I cannot understand increasing the compensation and benefits ... while the shareholders of the company continue to receive no dividends and watch our stock price decline," Koury writes. "I believe that it is time for the company to retain a qualified financial advisor to explore the company's strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including a sale."
Koury included a copy of his letter in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing that reports his stock holdings in Cape Fear. Those filings show that he has purchased more than 21,000 shares in the bank since late July and currently owns a total of 189,620 shares, or 5 percent of Cape Fear stock.
Coburn, asked for a response, confirmed he had received Koury's letter. "I always welcome comment from shareholders," Coburn says. "Our board will consider it thoroughly and comment at the appropriate time."
As for Cape Fear's financial performance, he adds, "We have a long-term plan for success that we believe will create results for our shareholders."
From its opening in June 1998 until October 2006, Cape Fear was known as the Bank of Wilmington. The name change was made to emphasize the institution's new commitment to counties - Brunswick and Pender - in the lower Cape Fear River region. The headquarters remains in Wilmington, in New Hanover County.





 


As of June 30, the bank had seven offices in the three counties, a staff of 99 and total assets of $441 million, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Return on equity - a number that reveals how much profit a bank is generating with shareholder commitments - dropped from 8 percent to 6.8 percent for the 12 months ending June 30, according to the FDIC. A median bank ROE is considered 10.22 percent, while superior is 12.30 percent and higher.
A native of Burlington who was born in 1929, Koury owns Carolina Hosiery Mills Inc., has developed hotels and served as a member of the UNC Board of Trustees. His fundraising efforts on behalf of UNC helped get the Dean E. Smith Center and the school's George Watts Hill Alumni Center off the ground.
He was a 10 percent stakeholder in Burlington's 1st State Bank, which was acquired by Raleigh's Capital Bank in early 2006.
In 2005, Koury was a vocal and public opponent of Smithfield-based KS Bank's plan to go private to avoid higher accounting costs. In the mind of Koury, who later accepted a buyout offer from KS managers, the plan would have limited shareholder transparency into bank performance.
"He's a man who says what he thinks," says Koury spokesman Milt Petty, adding that Koury wouldn't be taking follow-up questions regarding Cape Fear. "He said everything he has to say in the letter."

When an agreement is made without adjudication during an impending lawsuit, a settlement agreement lays out the terms of agreement between the parties. The parties (''Plaintiff'') and (''Defendant'') will come to an agreement on how they will cease the actions of the lawsuit.Settlement agreements enable opposing parties to bypass a lengthy court process by agreeing to specific terms and conditions which may include relief to plaintiff, method of payment (if any), attorney fees and other incurred costs.These agreements almost always contain confidentiality agreements, wherein the plaintiff of the lawsuit agrees to not disclose any details concerning the nature of the settlement to the press or other individuals.  A settlement agreement may be used in a divorce case or civil lawsuit.
