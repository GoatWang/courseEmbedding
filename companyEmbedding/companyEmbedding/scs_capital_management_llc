 Educational Background



Bachelor of Science Degree in Economics 


University of Pennsylvania - The Wharton School

                  The Wharton School is the business school of the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Wharton was the world’s first collegiate business school and the first business school in the United States. It was established in 1881 through a donation of Joseph Wharton.                





 Career History

SCS Capital Management LLC


                  SCS Capital Management designs an asset allocation strategy for each client based on the client’s overall wealth management plan. The strategy takes considers the client’s risk tolerance and return objectives to design a portfolio that combines lower return, lower risk investment classes, such as high quality bonds, with higher return seeking asset classes such as public and private equity investments. Most of the portfolio is invested with external investment managers and in SCS funds. The firm may also purchase securities directly to implement a portion of a wealth management program.SCS uses commercially available and proprietary databases to track investment managers in traditional and alternative asset classes. SCS recommends unaffiliated third party investment managers that specialize in the major asset classes, including cash management, fixed income, large-, mid- and small-cap stocks, international securities and alternative investments such as private equity and hedge funds.SCS' funds-of-hedge funds programs are designed to preserve and grow capital by producing absolute returns with reduced volatility and low correlation relative to the equity markets. SCS seeks to achieve strong relative performance through an intensive manager selection process while risk is managed through careful portfolio construction and diversification. The SCS invests fund assets among top tier hedge funds managed by new and established external managers. SCS may also invest a portion of certain funds' assets directly in securities and other instruments.In addition to traditional hedge fund strategies, SCS broadly classifies external managers into three categories; Growth, Uncorrelated and Defensive. Growth managers typically have long net exposure to markets. Uncorrelated managers focus on security selection for their returns and do not exhibit a directional bias. Defensive managers construct portfolios designed to offer protection by producing outsized returns in down markets.

Our Culture
Core Belief
If we put the interests of our clients first, everything else will fall into place. Our commitment to this singular philosophy is stronger than ever. It is evident in our unconflicted, consultative, client-centric culture, in the way we understand the expectations and needs of our clients, and in our passion to do our jobs with only the highest standards of excellence.
Client Alignment
Establishing a foundation of trust is the first step in offering successful financial strategy and investment management, and that kind of trust can only exist if we always avoid conflicts of interest with our clients. The only revenues we derive are advisory fees from our clients. We do not receive compensation from brokers or investment management firms to whom we allocate client capital.
Team Must Be Superior
We must attract and retain the industry's most talented professionals. Leading investment and financial strategy professionals choose SCS because we provide them with the environment, time, resources and advanced technology they need to do their best work and to address the best interests of the clients we serve. We believe that our culture and employee-ownership structure creates a more stable team than brokers and private banks.
A Strategic, Consultative Approach
Our clients will be more successful when our relationship is consultative, and when appropriate, comprehensive. We don't believe in a "one-size-fits-all" approach to investing. Our philosophy focuses on identifying the individual objectives of each client and applying our proven investment skills to achieve successful results. For Family Offices and Private Clients, it is not possible to optimize a family's after-tax wealth without integrating the investment strategy with their tax circumstances and the estate plan. For our institutional clients, we are both a strategic partner, providing a broad set of perspectives and resources, as well as being one of their investment managers. 
Never Accept Status Quo
We are dedicated to the continuous improvement of how we serve our clients. We think of it as a culture of curiosity. Great ideas that solve our clients' issues may be found within or outside our firm. Our insights and relationships with the leading minds in the investment management field allow us to gain critical exposure to a broad range of ideas. This elite "idea flow" accrues directly to our clients' benefit.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
