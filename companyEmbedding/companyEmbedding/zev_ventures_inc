	Market-Linked Step Up Notes Linked to One or More Equity Securities




	 





	




	 





	Market-Linked Step Up Notes (the 

	notes

	) are unsecured senior notes issued by Bank of America Corporation. Any payments due on the
	notes, including any repayment of principal, will be subject to the credit risk of Bank of America Corporation.






	 





	




	 





	The notes do not guarantee the return of principal at maturity, and we will not pay interest on the notes. Instead, the return on the notes will be
	based on the performance of an underlying 

	Market Measure

	, which will be the common equity securities of a company other than us and our affiliates (the 

	Underlying Stock

	). The Market Measure may also consist of a
	

	Basket

	 of two or more Underlying Stocks.






	 





	




	 





	The notes provide an opportunity to receive the greater of a fixed return or a return based on the positive performance of the Market Measure. However,
	you will be exposed to any negative performance of the Market Measure below the Threshold Value (as defined below) on a 1-to-1 basis. If specified in the applicable term sheet, your notes may be subject to an automatic call, which will limit your
	return to a fixed amount if the notes are called.






	 





	




	 





	If the value of the Market Measure does not change or increases from its Starting Value to its Ending Value up to the Step Up Value (each as defined
	below), you will receive at maturity a cash payment per unit (the 

	Redemption Amount

	) that equals the principal amount plus the Step Up Payment (as defined below). If the Ending Value is greater than the Step Up Value, you will
	receive a return on the notes equal to the percentage increase in the value of the Market Measure from the Starting Value to the Ending Value or, if applicable, a multiple of that percentage.






	 





	




	 





	If the value of the Market Measure decreases from its Starting Value to its Ending Value but not below the Threshold Value, then the Redemption Amount
	will equal the principal amount. However, if the Ending Value is less than the Threshold Value, you will be subject to 1-to-1 downside exposure to the decrease in the value of the Market Measure below the Threshold Value. In such a case, you may
	lose all or a significant portion of the principal amount of your notes.






	 





	




	 





	If specified in the applicable term sheet, your notes may be subject to an automatic call. In that case, the notes will be automatically called if the
	Observation Level on any Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Level (each as defined below). If called, you will receive a cash payment per unit (the 

	Call Amount

	) that equals the principal amount plus the
	applicable Call Premium (as defined below).






	 





	




	 





	This product supplement describes the general terms of the notes, the risk factors to consider before investing, the general manner in which they may
	be offered and sold, and other relevant information.






	 





	




	 





	For each offering of the notes, we will provide you with a pricing supplement (which we refer to as a 

	term sheet

	) that will describe
	the specific terms of that offering, including the specific Market Measure, the Step Up Value, the Step Up Payment, the Threshold Value, certain risk factors, and if the notes are subject to an automatic call, the Call Level, the Call Amount and the
	Call Premium for each Observation Date. The term sheet will identify, if applicable, any additions or changes to the terms specified in this product supplement.






	 





	




	 





	The notes will be issued in denominations of whole units. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable term sheet, each unit will have a principal
	amount of $10. The term sheet may also set forth a minimum number of units that you must purchase.






	 





	




	 





	Unless otherwise specified in the applicable term sheet, the notes will not be listed on a securities exchange or quotation system.






	 





	




	 





	One or more of our affiliates, including Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (

	MLPF&S

	), may act as our
	selling agents to offer the notes and will act in a principal capacity in such role.






	 


	 




	The notes are unsecured and are not savings
	accounts, deposits, or other obligations of a bank. The notes are not

	guaranteed by Bank of America, N.A. or any other bank, are not

	insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the 



	FDIC



	) or any other
	governmental agency and involve investment risks. Potential purchasers of the notes should consider the information in Risk Factors beginning on page PS-7 of this product supplement, page S-5 of the accompanying Series L prospectus
	supplement, and page 9 of the accompanying prospectus.



	You may lose all or a significant portion of your investment in the notes.









	None of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the 



	SEC



	), any state securities commission, or any other regulatory body has approved or disapproved of these securities
	or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this product supplement, the prospectus supplement, or the prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.

	SUMMARY





	The information in this Summary section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed explanation set forth elsewhere in
	this product supplement, the prospectus supplement, and the prospectus, as well as the applicable term sheet. Neither we nor MLPF&S have authorized any other person to provide you with any information different from the information set
	forth in these documents. If anyone provides you with different or inconsistent information about the notes, you should not rely on it.







	Key Terms:




	 














	General:





	  





	The notes are senior debt securities issued by Bank of America Corporation, and are not guaranteed or insured by the FDIC or secured
	by collateral. They rank equally with all of our other unsecured senior debt from time to time outstanding.

	Any payments due on the notes, including any repayment of principal, are subject to our credit risk.




	 



	The return on the notes will be based on the performance of a Market Measure and
	there is no guaranteed return of principal at maturity. Therefore, you may lose all or a significant portion of your investment if the notes are not called, if applicable, and the value of the Market Measure decreases from the Starting Value to an
	Ending Value that is less than the Threshold Value.



	 



	Each issue of the
	notes will mature on the date set forth in the applicable term sheet, unless, if applicable, the notes are automatically called on an earlier date. You should be aware that if the automatic call feature applies to your notes, it may shorten the term
	of an investment in the notes, and you must be willing to accept that your notes may be called prior to maturity.



	 



	You will not receive interest payments.














	Market Measure:





	  





	The common equity securities (an 

	Underlying Stock

	) of a company (the 

	Underlying Company

	)
	represented either by a class of equity securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 

	Exchange Act

	), or by American Depositary Receipts (

	ADRs

	) registered under the Exchange
	Act.



	 



	The Market Measure may consist of a group, or
	

	Basket

	, of Underlying Stocks. We refer to each Underlying Stock included in any Basket as a 

	Basket Stock

	. If the Market Measure to which your notes are linked is a Basket, the Basket Stocks will be set forth in
	the applicable term sheet.














	Market Measure Performance:





	  





	The performance of the Market Measure will be measured according to the percentage change of the Market Measure from its Starting
	Value to its Ending Value or Observation Level, if applicable.



	 



	Unless
	otherwise specified in the applicable term sheet:



	 



	The 

	Starting
	Value

	 will be the price of the Underlying Stock on the date when the notes are priced for initial sale to the public (the 

	pricing date

	), determined as set forth in the applicable term sheet.



	 



	If the Market Measure consists of a Basket, the Starting Value will be equal to 100.
	See Description of the NotesBasket Market Measures.



	 



	The
	

	Threshold Value

	 will be a value of the Market Measure that equals a specified percentage (100% or less) of the Starting Value. The Threshold Value will be determined on the pricing date and set forth in the term sheet. If the
	Threshold Value is equal to 100% of the Starting Value, you will be exposed to any decrease in the value of the Market Measure from the Starting Value to the Ending Value on a 1-to-1 basis, and you may lose all of your investment in the
	notes.








	 






	 






	PS-3




	 









	Table of Contents



















	  





	The 

	Ending Value

	 will equal the Closing Market Price (as defined below) of the Underlying Stock on the calculation
	day multiplied by its Price Multiplier on that day (each as defined below).



	 



	If the applicable term sheet specifies that the notes will be subject to an automatic call:



	 



	The 

	Call Level

	 will be a value of the Market Measure that equals
	a specified percentage of the Starting Value.



	 



	The 

	Observation
	Level

	 will equal the Closing Market Price of the Underlying Stock on the applicable Observation Date multiplied by its Price Multiplier on that day. The 

	Observation Dates

	 will be set forth in the applicable term sheet,
	subject to postponement in the event of Market Disruption Events. The final Observation Date will be prior to the calculation day. See Description of the NotesAutomatic Calls.



	 



	If a Market Disruption Event (as defined below) occurs and is continuing on the
	calculation day or an Observation Date, if applicable, or if certain other events occur, the calculation agent will determine the Ending Value or Observation Level, if applicable, as set forth in the section Description of the NotesThe
	Starting Value, the Observation Level and the Ending ValueEnding Value and Automatic Call.



	 



	If the Market Measure consists of a Basket, the Ending Value will be the value of the Basket on the calculation day, and if applicable, each Observation Level will be the value of the Basket on the
	applicable Observation Date, determined as described in Description of the NotesBasket Market MeasuresObservation Level or Ending Value of the Basket.














	Price Multiplier:





	  




	Unless otherwise set forth in the term sheet, the 

	Price Multiplier

	 for each Underlying Stock will be 1, and will be subject to adjustment for certain corporate
	events relating to an Underlying Stock described below under Description of the NotesAnti-Dilution Adjustments.













	Step Up Value:





	  




	A value of the Market Measure that is a specified percentage (over 100%) of the Starting Value, as set forth in the applicable term sheet.













	Step Up Payment:





	  




	A dollar amount that will be equal to a percentage of the principal amount. This percentage will equal the percentage by which the Step Up Value is greater than the Starting
	Value. The Step Up Payment will be determined on the pricing date and set forth in the applicable term sheet.













	Redemption Amount at Maturity:





	  





	At maturity, you will receive a Redemption Amount that is greater than the principal amount if the value of the Market Measure does
	not change or increases from the Starting Value to the Ending Value. If the value of the Market Measure decreases from the Starting Value to the Ending Value but not below the Threshold Value, then the Redemption Amount will equal the principal
	amount. If the Ending Value is less than the Threshold Value, you will be subject to 1-to-1 downside exposure to the decrease in the value of the Market Measure below the Threshold Value, and will receive a Redemption Amount that is less than the
	principal amount and, if the Threshold Value is equal to 100% of the Starting Value, could be zero.



	 




	Any payments due on the notes, including any repayment of principal, are subject to our credit risk as issuer of the notes.








	 






	 






	PS-4




	 









	Table of Contents



















	  





	The Redemption Amount, denominated in U.S. dollars, will be calculated as follows:



	 





	 



	If specified in the applicable term sheet, your
	notes may provide at maturity a leveraged return if the Ending Value is greater than the Step Up Value. In this case, a Participation Rate (defined below) will be specified in the term sheet.














	Automatic Call:





	  




	If specified in the applicable term sheet, your notes may be subject to an automatic call. In that case, the notes will be automatically called on an Observation Date if the
	Observation Level of the Market Measure on that Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Level. If not called, see Redemption Amount at Maturity above.













	Call Amount:





	  




	If your notes are subject to an automatic call and are called on an Observation Date, you will receive the Call Amount applicable to that Observation Date. The Call Amount will
	be equal to the principal amount per unit plus the applicable 

	Call Premium

	. Each Call Premium will be a percentage of the principal amount based on the period of time elapsed between the settlement date and the applicable
	Observation Date and will be set forth in the applicable term sheet. The Call Amount, if payable, will be payable on the applicable 

	Call Settlement Date

	 set forth in the applicable term sheet.













	Participation Rate:





	  




	The Participation Rate, if applicable, is the rate at which investors participate in any increase in the value of the Market Measure if the Ending Value is greater than the Step
	Up Value.













	Principal at Risk:





	  




	You may lose all or a significant portion of the principal amount of the notes. Further, if you sell your notes prior to maturity, you may find that the market value per note is
	less than the price that you paid for the notes.













	Calculation Agent:





	  




	The calculation agent will make all determinations associated with the notes. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable term sheet, we expect to appoint our affiliate,
	MLPF&S, or one of our other affiliates, to act as calculation agent for the notes. See the section entitled Description of the NotesRole of the Calculation Agent.













	Selling Agents:





	  




	One or more of our affiliates, including MLPF&S, will act as our selling agents in connection with each offering of the notes and will receive a commission or an underwriting
	discount based on the number of units of the notes sold. None of the selling agents is your fiduciary or advisor solely as a result of the making of any

	offering of the notes, and you should not rely upon this product supplement, the term sheet, or the accompanying prospectus or prospectus supplement as investment advice or a
	recommendation to purchase the notes.













	Listing:





	  




	Unless otherwise specified in the applicable term sheet, the notes will not be listed on a securities exchange or quotation system.






	This product supplement relates only to the notes and does not relate to any Underlying Stock described
	in any term sheet. You should read carefully the entire prospectus, prospectus supplement, and product supplement, together with the applicable term sheet, to understand fully the terms of your notes, as well as the tax and other considerations
	important to you in making a decision about whether to invest in any notes. In particular, you should review carefully the section in this product supplement entitled Risk Factors, which highlights a number of risks of an investment in
	the notes, to determine whether an investment in the notes is appropriate for you. If information in this product supplement is inconsistent with the prospectus or prospectus supplement, this product supplement will supersede those documents.
	However, if information in any term sheet is inconsistent with this product supplement, that term sheet will supersede this product supplement. For example, we may offer notes in which the Step Up Payment will be paid if the Ending Value equals or
	exceeds the Threshold Value. You should carefully review the applicable term sheet to understand the specific terms of your notes.




	Neither we nor any selling agent is making an offer to sell the notes in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted.




	Certain capitalized terms used and not defined in this product supplement have the meanings ascribed to them in the prospectus supplement
	and prospectus. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this product supplement to we, us, our, or similar references are to Bank of America Corporation.




	You are urged to consult with your own attorneys and business and tax advisors before making a decision to purchase any notes.

	RISK FACTORS






	Your investment in the notes is subject to investment risks, many of which differ from those of a conventional debt security. Your
	decision to purchase the notes should be made only after carefully considering the risks, including those discussed below, in light of your particular circumstances. The notes are not an appropriate investment for you if you are not knowledgeable
	about the material terms of the notes or investments in equity or equity-based securities in general.






	General Risks Relating to the
	Notes






	Your investment may result in a loss; there is no guaranteed return of principal.

	There is no fixed
	principal repayment amount on the notes at maturity. The return on the notes will be based on the performance of the Market Measure and therefore, you may lose all or a significant portion of your investment if the value of the Market Measure
	decreases from the Starting Value to an Ending Value that is less than the Threshold Value. If the Ending Value is less than the Threshold Value, then you will receive a Redemption Amount at maturity that will be less than the principal amount of
	your notes and, if the Threshold Value is equal to 100% of the Starting Value, the Redemption Amount could be zero.





	Your
	return on the notes may be less than the yield on a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity.

	There will be no periodic interest payments on the notes as there would be on a conventional fixed-rate or
	floating-rate debt security having the same maturity. Any return that you receive on the notes may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased a conventional debt security with the same maturity date. As a result, your investment in the
	notes may not reflect the full opportunity cost to you when you consider factors, such as inflation, that affect the time value of money.





	Your investment return is limited to the return represented by the Call Premium, if applicable, and may be less than a comparable investment directly in the Market Measure.

	If the notes are subject
	to an automatic call, and if the Observation Level of the Market Measure on an Observation Date is equal to or greater than the specified Call Level, we will automatically call the notes. If the notes are automatically called, your return will be
	limited to the applicable Call Premium, regardless of the extent of the increase in the value of the Market Measure.




	In
	addition, unless otherwise set forth in the applicable term sheet and this product supplement under Description of the NotesAnti-Dilution Adjustments, the Ending Value and the Observation Levels, if applicable, will not reflect the
	value of dividends paid, or distributions made, on an Underlying Stock, or any other rights associated with an Underlying Stock. Your return on the notes will not reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of an Underlying
	Stock.





	Reinvestment Risk.

	 If the notes are subject to an automatic call and are automatically called prior to
	maturity, the term of the notes will be shorter. There is no guarantee that you would be able to reinvest the proceeds from an investment in the notes at a comparable return for a similar level of risk in the event the notes are called prior to
	maturity.





	Payments on the notes are subject to our credit risk, and actual or perceived changes in our creditworthiness
	are expected to affect the value of the notes.

	The notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result, your receipt of any payments on the notes is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment date,
	regardless of whether the Market Measure increases from the Starting Value to the Ending Value, or the Observation Level, if applicable. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be on the applicable payment date. If we
	become unable to meet our




	 




	PS-7







	Table of Contents




	financial obligations as they become due, you may not receive the amounts payable under the terms of the notes.




	In addition, our credit ratings are an assessment by ratings agencies of our ability to pay our obligations. Consequently, our perceived creditworthiness and actual or anticipated decreases in our credit
	ratings or increases in the spread between the yield on our securities and the yield on U.S. Treasury securities (the 

	credit spread

	) prior to the maturity date may adversely affect the market value of the notes. However, because
	your return on the notes depends upon factors in addition to our ability to pay our obligations, such as the value of the Market Measure, an improvement in our credit ratings will not reduce the other investment risks related to the notes.





	The initial estimated value of the notes considers certain assumptions and variables and relies in part on certain
	forecasts about future events, which may prove to be incorrect.

	The initial estimated value of the notes, which will be set forth in the applicable term sheet, is an estimate only, determined as of a particular point in time by reference to our
	and our affiliates pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables, including our credit spreads, our internal funding rate on the pricing date, mid-market terms on hedging transactions, expectations on interest
	rates, and volatility, price-sensitivity analysis, and the expected term of the notes. These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events, which may prove to be incorrect.





	The public offering price you pay for the notes will exceed the initial estimated value.

	If you attempt to sell the notes prior to
	maturity, their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and lower than the initial estimated value. This is due to, among other things, changes in the value of the Market Measure, our internal funding rate, and the inclusion in
	the public offering price of the underwriting discount and an expected hedging related charge. These factors, together with various credit, market and economic factors over the term of the notes, are expected to reduce the price at which you may be
	able to sell the notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the notes in complex and unpredictable ways.




	The
	initial estimated value does not represent a minimum or maximum price at which we, MLPF&S or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase your notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The value of your notes at any time
	after issuance will vary based on many factors that cannot be predicted with accuracy, including the performance of the Market Measure, our creditworthiness and changes in market conditions.





	We cannot assure you that there will be a trading market for your notes.

	If a secondary market exists, we cannot predict how the
	notes will trade, or whether that market will be liquid or illiquid. The development of a trading market for the notes will depend on various factors, including our financial performance and changes in the value of the Market Measure. The number of
	potential buyers of your notes in any secondary market may be limited. There is no assurance that any party will be willing to purchase your notes at any price in any secondary market.




	We anticipate that one or more of the selling agents will act as a market-maker for the notes that it offers, but none of them is
	required to do so and may cease to do so at any time. Any price at which a selling agent may bid for, offer, purchase, or sell any of the notes may be higher or lower than the applicable public offering price, and that price may differ from the
	values determined by pricing models that it may use, whether as a result of dealer discounts, mark-ups, or other transaction costs. These bids, offers, or transactions may affect the prices, if any, at which the notes might otherwise trade in the
	market. In addition, if at any time any




	 




	PS-8







	Table of Contents




	selling agent were to cease acting as a market-maker for any issue of the notes, it is likely that there would be significantly less liquidity in that secondary market. In such a case, the price
	at which those notes could be sold likely would be lower than if an active market existed.




	Unless otherwise stated in the
	term sheet, we will not list the notes on any securities exchange. Even if an application were made to list your notes, we cannot assure you that the application will be approved or that your notes will be listed and, if listed, that they will
	remain listed for their entire term. The listing of the notes on any securities exchange will not necessarily ensure that a trading market will develop, and if a trading market does develop, that there will be liquidity in the trading market.





	Payments on the notes will not reflect changes in the value of the Market Measure other than on the calculation day or the
	Observation Dates, if applicable.

	Changes in the value of the Market Measure during the term of the notes other than on the calculation day, or the Observation Dates, if applicable, will not be reflected in the calculation of the amount payable
	on the notes. To make that calculation, the calculation agent will refer only to the value of the Market Measure on the calculation day, or the Observation Dates, if applicable. No other values of the Market Measure will be taken into account. As a
	result, even if the value of the Market Measure has increased at certain times during the term of the notes, your notes will not be called, if applicable, if the Observation Level on each Observation Date is less than the Call Level, and you will
	receive a Redemption Amount that is less than the principal amount if the Ending Value is less than the Threshold Value.





	If your notes are linked to a Basket, changes in the prices of one or more of the Basket Stocks may be offset by changes in the prices
	of one or more of the other Basket Stocks.

	The Market Measure of your notes may be a Basket. In such a case, changes in the prices of one or more of the Basket Stocks may not correlate with changes in the prices of one or more of the other
	Basket Stocks. The prices of one or more Basket Stocks may increase, while the prices of one or more of the other Basket Stocks may decrease or not increase as much. Therefore, in calculating the value of the Market Measure at any time, increases in
	the price of one Basket Stock may be moderated or wholly offset by decreases or lesser increases in the prices of one or more of the other Basket Stocks. If the weightings of the applicable Basket Stocks are not equal, adverse changes in the prices
	of the Basket Stocks which are more heavily weighted could have a greater impact upon your notes.





	If you attempt to sell
	the notes prior to maturity, their market value, if any, will be affected by various factors that interrelate in complex ways, and their market value may be less than the principal amount.

	The limited protection against the risk of losses
	provided by the Threshold Value, if any, will only apply if you hold the notes to maturity. You have no right to have your notes redeemed at your option prior to maturity. If you wish to liquidate your investment in the notes prior to maturity, your
	only option would be to sell them. At that time, there may be an illiquid market for your notes or no market at all. Even if you were able to sell your notes, there are many factors outside of our control that may affect their market value, some of
	which, but not all, are stated below. The impact of any one factor may be offset or magnified by the effect of another factor. The following paragraphs describe a specific factors expected impact on the market value of the notes, assuming all
	other conditions remain constant.



	 





	 




	




	 






	Value of the Market Measure.

	We anticipate that the market value of the notes prior to maturity generally will depend to a significant extent on
	the value of the Market Measure. In general, it is expected that the market value of the notes will decrease as the value of the Market Measure decreases, and increase as the value of the Market Measure increases. However, as the value of the Market
	Measure increases or decreases, the







	 




	PS-9







	Table of Contents






	 





	market value of the notes is not expected to increase or decrease at the same rate. If you sell your notes when the value of the Market Measure is less than, or not sufficiently above, the
	Starting Value, then you may receive less than the principal amount of your notes.







	In addition, if the
	notes are subject to an automatic call, because the amount payable on the notes upon an automatic call will not exceed the applicable Call Amount, we do not expect that the notes will trade in any secondary market prior to any Observation Date at a
	price that is greater than the applicable Call Amount.



	 





	 




	




	 






	Volatility of the Market Measure.

	Volatility is the term used to describe the size and frequency of market fluctuations. Increases or decreases
	in the volatility of the Market Measure may have an adverse impact on the market value of the notes. Even if the value of the Market Measure increases after the applicable pricing date, if you are able to sell your notes before their maturity date,
	you may receive substantially less than the amount that would be payable on any Call Settlement Date, if applicable, or at maturity based on that value because of the anticipation that the value of the Market Measure will continue to fluctuate until
	the calculation day.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Economic and Other Conditions Generally.

	The general economic conditions of the capital markets in the United States, as well as geopolitical
	conditions and other financial, political, regulatory, and judicial events and related uncertainties that affect stock markets generally, may affect the value of the Market Measure and the market value of the notes.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Interest Rates.

	We expect that changes in interest rates will affect the market value of the notes. In general, if U.S. interest rates increase,
	we expect that the market value of the notes will decrease, and conversely, if U.S. interest rates decrease, we expect that the market value of the notes will increase. In general, we expect that the longer the amount of time that remains until
	maturity, the more significant the impact of these changes will be on the value of the notes. The level of interest rates also may affect the U.S. economy and any applicable market outside of the U.S., and, in turn, the value of the Market Measure,
	and, thus, the market value of the notes may be adversely affected. If any Underlying Stock is an ADR, the level of interest rates in the relevant foreign country may affect the economy of that foreign country and, in turn, the value of the ADR,
	and, thus, the market value of the notes may be adversely affected.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Dividend Yields.

	In general, if the cumulative dividend yield on any Underlying Stock increases, we anticipate that the market value of the
	notes will decrease; conversely, if that dividend yield decreases, we anticipate that the market value of your notes will increase.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Our Financial Condition and Creditworthiness.

	Our perceived creditworthiness, including any increases in our credit spreads and any actual or
	anticipated decreases in our credit ratings, may adversely affect the market value of the notes. In general, we expect the longer the amount of time that remains until maturity, the more significant the impact will be on the value of the notes.
	However, a decrease in our credit spreads or an improvement in our credit ratings will not necessarily increase the market value of the notes.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Time to Maturity or, if Applicable, Next Observation Date.

	There may be a disparity between the market value of the notes prior to maturity, or
	if applicable, prior to an







	 




	PS-10







	Table of Contents






	 





	Observation Date, and their value at maturity or as of the next Observation Date, if applicable. This disparity is often called a time value, premium, or
	discount, and reflects expectations concerning the value of the Market Measure during the term of the notes. As the time to maturity, or if applicable, the next Observation Date, decreases, this disparity may decrease, such that the
	value of the notes will approach the expected Redemption Amount to be paid at maturity, or if applicable, the Call Amount to be paid at the next Call Settlement Date.








	Trading and hedging activities by us and our affiliates may affect your return on the notes and their market value.

	We and our
	affiliates, including the selling agents, may buy or sell shares of any Underlying Stock, futures or options contracts on any Underlying Stock, or other listed or over-the counter derivative instruments linked to any Underlying Stock. We may execute
	such purchases or sales for our own accounts, for business reasons, or in connection with hedging our obligations under the notes. These transactions could affect the value of an Underlying Stock in a manner that could be adverse to your investment
	in the notes. On or before the applicable pricing date, any purchases by us, our affiliates or others on our behalf may increase the value of an Underlying Stock. Consequently, the value of that Underlying Stock may decrease subsequent to the
	pricing date of an issue of the notes, adversely affect the market value of the notes.




	We, or one or more of our affiliates,
	including the selling agents, may also engage in hedging activities that could increase the value of the Market Measure on the applicable pricing date. In addition, these activities may decrease the market value of your notes prior to maturity,
	including on the calculation day, or if applicable, on each Observation Date, and may adversely affect the payments on the notes. We or one or more of our affiliates, including the selling agents, may purchase or otherwise acquire a long or short
	position in the notes, and may hold or resell the notes. For example, the selling agents may enter into these transactions in connection with any market making activities in which they engage. We cannot assure you that these activities will not
	adversely affect the value of the Market Measure, the market value of your notes prior to maturity, or the payments on the notes.





	Our trading, hedging and other business activities may create conflicts of interest with you.

	We or one or more of our affiliates, including the selling agents, may engage in trading activities
	related to an Underlying Stock that are not for your account or on your behalf. We or one or more of our affiliates, including the selling agents, also may issue or underwrite other financial instruments with returns based upon the applicable
	Underlying Stock. These trading and other business activities may present a conflict of interest between your interest in the notes and the interests we and our affiliates, including the selling agents, may have in our proprietary accounts, in
	facilitating transactions, including block trades, for our or their other customers, and in accounts under our or their management. These trading and other business activities, if they influence the value of the Market Measure or secondary trading
	in your notes, could be adverse to your interests as a beneficial owner of the notes.




	We expect to enter into arrangements or
	adjust or close out existing transactions to hedge our obligations under the notes. We or our affiliates also may enter into hedging transactions relating to other notes or instruments that we issue, some of which may have returns calculated in a
	manner related to that of a particular issue of the notes. We may enter into such hedging arrangements with one of our subsidiaries or affiliates. Such a party may enter into additional hedging transactions with other parties relating to the notes
	and the applicable Underlying Stock. This hedging activity is expected to result in a profit to those engaging in the hedging activity, which could be more or less than initially expected, or the hedging activity could also result in a loss. We or
	our affiliates will price these hedging transactions with the intent to realize a profit, regardless of whether the value of the notes




	 




	PS-11







	Table of Contents




	increases or decreases. Any profit in connection with such hedging activities will be in addition to any other compensation that we and our affiliates, including the selling agents, receive for
	the sale of the notes, which creates an additional incentive to sell the notes to you.





	There may be potential conflicts of
	interest involving the calculation agent. We have the right to appoint and remove the calculation agent.

	One of our affiliates will be the calculation agent for the notes and, as such, will determine the Starting Value, the Step Up Value, the
	Threshold Value, the Ending Value, the Redemption Amount, and if applicable, the Call Level and each Observation Level and whether the notes will be called. Under some circumstances, these duties could result in a conflict of interest between its
	status as our affiliate and its responsibilities as calculation agent. These conflicts could occur, for instance, in connection with the calculation agents determination as to whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred, or in connection
	with judgments that it would be required to make if certain corporate events occur with respect to any Underlying Stock. See the sections entitled Description of the NotesMarket Disruption Events and Anti-Dilution
	Adjustments. The calculation agent will be required to carry out its duties in good faith and use its reasonable judgment. However, because we expect to control the calculation agent, potential conflicts of interest could arise.





	The U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes are uncertain, and may be adverse to a holder of the notes.

	No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addresses the characterization of the notes or securities similar to the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax
	consequences of an investment in the notes are not certain. Under the terms of the notes, you will have agreed with us to treat the notes as single financial contracts, as described under U.S. Federal Income Tax SummaryGeneral. If
	the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) were successful in asserting an alternative characterization for the notes, the timing and character of gain or loss with respect to the notes may differ. No ruling will be requested from the IRS
	with respect to the notes and no assurance can be given that the IRS will agree with the statements made in the section entitled U.S. Federal Income Tax Summary.




	You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of investing in the notes.





	Risks Relating to an Underlying Stock






	You must rely on your own evaluation of the merits of an investment linked to any applicable Underlying Stock.

	In the ordinary course of business, our affiliates may have expressed views on
	expected movements in an Underlying Stock, and may do so in the future. These views or reports may be communicated to our clients and clients of our affiliates. However, these views are subject to change from time to time. Moreover, other
	professionals who deal in markets relating to an Underlying Stock may at any time have significantly different views from those of our affiliates. For these reasons, you are encouraged to derive information concerning an Underlying Stock from
	multiple sources, and you should not rely on the views expressed by our affiliates.





	You will have no rights as a security
	holder, you will have no rights to receive any shares of any Underlying Stock, and you will not be entitled to dividends or other distributions by any Underlying Company.

	The notes are our debt securities. They are not equity instruments, shares
	of stock, or securities of any other issuer. Investing in the notes will not make you a holder of any Underlying Stock. You will not have any voting rights, any rights to receive dividends or other distributions, or any other rights with respect to
	any Underlying Stock. As a result, the return on your notes may not reflect the return you would




	 




	PS-12







	Table of Contents




	realize if you actually owned shares of any Underlying Stock and received the dividends paid or other distributions made in connection with them. Your notes will be paid in cash and you have no
	right to receive delivery of shares of any Underlying Stock.





	If shares of an Underlying Company are also listed on a
	foreign exchange, your return may be affected by factors affecting international securities markets.

	The value of securities traded outside of the U.S. may be adversely affected by a variety of factors relating to the relevant securities
	markets. Factors which could affect those markets, and therefore the return on your notes, include:





	 





	 




	




	 






	Market Volatility.

	The relevant foreign securities markets may be more volatile than U.S. or other securities markets and may be affected by
	market developments in different ways than U.S. or other securities markets.






	 





	 




	




	 






	Political, Economic, and Other Factors.

	The prices and performance of securities of companies in foreign countries may be affected by political,
	economic, financial, and social factors in those regions. Direct or indirect government intervention to stabilize a particular securities market and cross-shareholdings in companies in the relevant foreign markets may affect prices and the volume of
	trading in those markets. In addition, recent or future changes in government, economic, and fiscal policies in the relevant jurisdictions, the possible imposition of, or changes in, currency exchange laws, or other laws or restrictions, and
	possible fluctuations in the rate of exchange between currencies, are factors that could negatively affect the relevant securities markets. The relevant foreign economies may differ from the U.S. economy in economic factors such as growth of gross
	national product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment, resources, and self-sufficiency.







	In particular,
	many emerging nations are undergoing rapid change, involving the restructuring of economic, political, financial and legal systems. Regulatory and tax environments may be subject to change without review or appeal, and many emerging markets suffer
	from underdevelopment of capital markets and tax systems. In addition, in some of these nations, issuers of the relevant securities face the threat of expropriation of their assets and/or nationalization of their businesses. The economic and
	financial data about some of these countries may be unreliable.





	We do not control any Underlying Company and have not
	verified any disclosure made by any Underlying Company.

	We or our affiliates currently, or in the future, may engage in business with any Underlying Company, and we or our affiliates may from time to time own securities of any Underlying
	Company. However, neither we nor any of our affiliates, including the selling agents, have the ability to control any actions of any Underlying Company or have undertaken any independent review of, or made any due diligence inquiry with respect to,
	any Underlying Company. You should make your own investigation into any Underlying Stock.





	Our business activities relating
	to any Underlying Company may create conflicts of interest with you.

	We and our affiliates, including the selling agents, at the time of any offering of the notes or in the future, may engage in business with any Underlying Company, including
	making loans to, equity investments in, or providing investment banking, asset management, or other services to that company, its affiliates, and its competitors.




	In connection with these activities, we or our affiliates may receive information about those companies that we will not divulge to you or other third parties. One or more of our affiliates have
	published, and in the future may publish, research reports on one or more of




	 




	PS-13







	Table of Contents




	these companies. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding your notes. Any of
	these activities may affect the value of the Market Measure and, consequently, the market value of your notes. We, or any of our affiliates, do not make any representation to any purchasers of the notes regarding any matters whatsoever relating to
	any Underlying Company. Any prospective purchaser of the notes should undertake an independent investigation of any Underlying Company to a level that, in its judgment, is appropriate to make an informed decision regarding an investment in the
	notes. The selection of an Underlying Stock does not reflect any investment recommendations from us or our affiliates.





	An
	Underlying Company will have no obligations relating to the notes and we will not perform any due diligence procedures with respect to any Underlying Company.

	An Underlying Company will not have any financial or legal obligation with respect to
	the notes or the amounts to be paid to you, including any obligation to take our needs or the needs of noteholders into consideration for any reason, including taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of an Underlying Stock or the
	value of the notes. An Underlying Company will not receive any of the proceeds from any offering of the notes, and will not be responsible for, or participate in, the offering of the notes. No Underlying Company will be responsible for, or
	participate in, the determination or calculation of the amount receivable by holders of the notes.




	Neither we nor any selling
	agent will conduct any due diligence inquiry with respect to any Underlying Stock in connection with an offering of the notes. Neither we nor any selling agent has made any independent investigation as to the completeness or accuracy of publicly
	available information regarding any Underlying Company or as to the future performance of any Underlying Stock. Any prospective purchaser of the notes should undertake such independent investigation of any Underlying Company as in its judgment is
	appropriate to make an informed decision with respect to an investment in the notes.





	The payment on the notes will not be
	adjusted for all corporate events that could affect an Underlying Company.

	The Price Multiplier, the relevant Observation Level, if applicable, the Ending Value, the payment on the notes, and other terms of the notes may be adjusted for the
	specified corporate events affecting any Underlying Stock, as described in the section entitled Description of the NotesAnti-Dilution Adjustments. However, these adjustments do not cover all corporate events that could affect the
	market price of an Underlying Stock, such as offerings of common shares for cash or in connection with certain acquisition transactions. The occurrence of any event that does not require the calculation agent to adjust the applicable Price
	Multiplier or the amount paid to you on the notes may adversely affect the Closing Market Price of an Underlying Stock, an Observation Level, if applicable, the Ending Value and the payment on the notes, and, as a result, the market value of the
	notes.





	Risks Relating to Underlying Stocks that Are ADRs






	The value of an ADR may not accurately track the value of the common shares of the related Underlying Company.

	If an Underlying
	Stock is an ADR, each ADR will represent shares of the relevant Underlying Company. Generally, the ADRs are issued under a deposit agreement that sets forth the rights and responsibilities of the depositary, the Underlying Company and the holders of
	the ADRs. The trading patterns of the ADRs will generally reflect the characteristics and valuations of the underlying common shares; however, the value of the ADRs may not completely track the value of those shares. There are important differences
	between the rights of holders of ADRs and the rights of holders of the underlying common shares. In addition, trading volume and pricing on the applicable non-U.S. exchange may, but




	 




	PS-14







	Table of Contents




	will not necessarily, have similar characteristics as the ADRs. For example, certain factors may increase or decrease the public float of the ADRs and, as a result, the ADRs may have less
	liquidity or lower market value than the underlying common shares.





	Exchange rate movements may adversely impact the value
	of an Underlying Stock that is an ADR.

	If an Underlying Stock is an ADR, the market price of the Underlying Stock will generally track the U.S. dollar value of the market price of the underlying common shares. Therefore, if the value of the
	related foreign currency in which the underlying common shares are traded decreases relative to the U.S. dollar, the market price of the Underlying Stock may decrease while the market price of the underlying common shares remains stable or
	increases, or does not decrease to the same extent. As a result, changes in, and the volatility of, the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the relevant non-U.S. currency could have a negative impact on the value of the Underlying Stock and
	consequently, the value of your notes and the amount payable on the notes.





	Adverse trading conditions in the applicable
	non-U.S. market may negatively affect the value of an Underlying Stock that is an ADR.

	Holders of an Underlying Companys ADRs may usually surrender the ADRs in order to receive and trade the underlying common shares. This provision permits
	investors in the ADRs to take advantage of price differentials between markets. However, this provision may also cause the market prices of the applicable Underlying Stock to more closely correspond with the values of the common shares in the
	applicable non-U.S. markets. As a result, a market outside of the United States for the underlying common shares that is not liquid may also result in an illiquid market for the ADRs, which may negatively impact the value of such ADRs and,
	consequently, the value of your notes.





	Delisting of an Underlying Stock that is an ADR may adversely
	affect the value of the notes.

	If an Underlying Stock that is an ADR is no longer listed or admitted to trading on a U.S. securities exchange registered under the Exchange Act or included in the OTC Bulletin Board Service operated by the
	Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (

	FINRA

	), or if the ADR facility between the Underlying Company and the ADR depositary is terminated for any reason, the Market Measure for the notes will be deemed to be the Underlying
	Companys common equity securities rather than the ADRs, and the calculation agent will determine the price of the Market Measure by reference to those common shares, as described below under Description of the NotesDelisting of
	ADRs or Termination of ADR Facility. Replacing the original ADRs with the underlying common shares may adversely affect the value of the notes and the payment on the notes.








	Other Risk Factors Relating to an Underlying Stock





	The applicable term sheet may set forth additional risk factors as to an Underlying Stock that you should review prior to purchasing the notes.

	USE OF PROCEEDS





	We will use the net proceeds we receive from each sale of the notes for the purposes described in the accompanying prospectus under
	Use of Proceeds. In addition, we expect that we or our affiliates may use a portion of the net proceeds to hedge our obligations under the notes.

	DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES






	General





	Each issue of
	the notes will be part of a series of medium-term notes entitled Medium-Term Notes, Series L that will be issued under the Senior Indenture, as amended and supplemented from time to time. The Senior Indenture is described more fully in
	the prospectus and prospectus supplement. The following description of the notes supplements and, to the extent it is inconsistent with, supersedes the description of the general terms and provisions of the notes and debt securities set forth under
	the headings Description of the Notes in the prospectus supplement and Description of Debt Securities in the prospectus. These documents should be read in connection with the applicable term sheet.




	The maturity date of the notes and the aggregate principal amount of each issue of the notes will be stated in the term sheet. If any
	scheduled payment date for the notes is not a business day, we will make the required payment on the next business day, and no interest will accrue as a result of such delay.




	We will not pay interest on the notes. The notes do not guarantee the return of principal at maturity. The notes will be payable only in U.S. dollars.




	Unless subject to an automatic call and automatically called prior to the maturity date, or redeemed under the limited circumstances set
	forth below, the notes will mature on the date set forth in the applicable term sheet. Prior to the maturity date, the notes are not redeemable at the option of any holder. The notes are not subject to any sinking fund.




	We will issue the notes in denominations of whole units. Unless otherwise set forth in the applicable term sheet, each unit will have a
	principal amount of $10. The CUSIP number for each issue of the notes will be set forth in the applicable term sheet. You may transfer the notes only in whole units.





	Payment at Maturity





	If the notes are not subject to an automatic call or
	if the notes are subject to an automatic call but are not called, then at maturity, subject to our credit risk as issuer of the notes, you will receive a Redemption Amount, denominated in U.S. dollars. In no event will the Redemption Amount be less
	than zero. The 

	Redemption Amount

	 will be calculated as follows:



	 





	 




	




	 





	If the Ending Value is greater than the Step Up Value, then the Redemption Amount will equal:






	 






	If specified in the applicable term sheet, at maturity, your notes may provide a leveraged return if
	the Ending Value is greater than the Step Up Value. In this case, a Participation Rate will be specified in the term sheet.



	 





	 




	




	 





	If the Ending Value is equal to or greater than the Starting Value but is equal to or less than the Step Up Value, then the Redemption Amount will
	equal:







	 




	PS-17







	Table of Contents




	Principal Amount + Step Up Payment



	 





	 




	




	 





	If the Ending Value is less than the Starting Value, but is equal to or greater than the Threshold Value, then the Redemption Amount will equal the
	principal amount.






	 





	 




	




	 





	If the Ending Value is less than the Threshold Value, then the Redemption Amount will equal:






	 






	The Redemption Amount will not be less than zero.




	The 

	Step Up Value

	 will be a value of the Market Measure that is a specified percentage (over 100%) of the Starting
	Value, as set forth in the applicable term sheet.




	The 

	Step Up Payment

	 will be a dollar amount that will be
	equal to a percentage of the principal amount. This percentage will equal the percentage by which the Step Up Value is greater than the Starting Value. The Step Up Payment will be determined on the pricing date and set forth in the applicable term
	sheet.




	The 

	Threshold Value

	 will be a value of the Market Measure that equals a specified percentage of the
	Starting Value, which will be less than or equal to 100%. The Threshold Value will be determined on the pricing date and set forth in the term sheet. If the Threshold Value is equal to 100% of the Starting Value, then the Redemption Amount for the
	notes will be less than the principal amount if there is any decrease in the value of the Market Measure from the Starting Value to the Ending Value, and you may lose all of your investment in the notes.




	The 

	Participation Rate

	 if applicable, is the rate at which investors participate in any increase in the value of the
	Market Measure.




	Each term sheet will provide examples of Redemption Amounts based on a range of hypothetical Ending Values.




	The term sheet will set forth information as to the specific Market Measure, including information as to the historical
	prices of the Underlying Stock or Underlying Stocks. However, historical prices of any Underlying Stock are not indicative of its future performance or the performance of your notes.




	An investment in the notes does not entitle you to any ownership interest, including any voting rights, in any Underlying Stock, nor
	dividends paid or other distributions made by any Underlying Company.





	Automatic Call





	If specified in the applicable term sheet, the notes may be subject to an automatic call. In that case, the notes will be called, in
	whole but not in part, if the Observation Level of the Market Measure on any Observation Date is greater than or equal to the Call Level set forth in the applicable term sheet.




	 




	PS-18







	Table of Contents




	The 

	Call Level

	 will be a value of the Market Measure that equals a
	specified percentage of the Starting Value.




	The 

	Observation Dates

	 will be set forth in the applicable term
	sheet, subject to postponement in the event of Market Disruption Events. The final Observation Date will be prior to the calculation day.




	If the notes are called on an Observation Date, for each unit of notes that you own, we will pay you the Call Amount applicable to that Observation Date on the Call Settlement Date. The 

	Call
	Amount

	 will be equal to the principal amount plus the applicable Call Premium. The 

	Call Premium

	 will be a percentage of the principal amount and will be set forth in the applicable term sheet.




	The Observation Dates and the relevant Call Amounts and Call Premiums will be specified in the applicable term sheet.




	If the notes are automatically called on an Observation Date, we will redeem the notes and pay the applicable Call Amount on the
	applicable Call Settlement Date. Each 

	Call Settlement Date

	 will occur on approximately the fifth business day after the applicable Observation Date, subject to postponement as described below.




	If there is a Market Disruption Event on a scheduled Observation Date, the relevant Observation Date will be the immediately succeeding
	trading day on which a Market Disruption Event does not occur; provided that the Closing Market Price of the Underlying Stock for the relevant Observation Date will not be determined on a date later than the fifth scheduled trading day after the
	scheduled Observation Date, and if there is a Market Disruption Event on that date, the calculation agent will determine the Closing Market Price of the Underlying Stock for the relevant Observation Date (or, if not determinable, estimate) in a
	commercially reasonable manner on that fifth scheduled trading day.




	If, due to a Market Disruption Event or otherwise, a
	scheduled Observation Date is postponed, the Call Settlement Date, if applicable, will be approximately the fifth business day following the Observation Date as postponed, unless otherwise specified in the applicable term sheet.




	Unless otherwise specified in the applicable term sheet, a business day is any day other than a day on which banking
	institutions in New York, New York are authorized or required by law, regulation, or executive order to close or a day on which transactions in U.S. dollars are not conducted.





	The Starting Value, the Observation Level and the Ending Value






	Starting Value





	The 

	Starting Value

	 will be the price of the Underlying Stock on the pricing date, determined as set forth in the term sheet.




	If the Market Measure consists of a Basket, the Starting Value will be equal to 100. See Basket Market Measures.




	 




	PS-19







	Table of Contents





	Observation Level





	The 

	Observation Level

	 will equal the Closing Market Price of the Underlying Stock on the relevant Observation Date
	multiplied by its Price Multiplier on that day.





	Ending Value





	The 

	Ending Value

	 will be the Closing Market Price of the Underlying Stock on the calculation day multiplied by its
	Price Multiplier on that day.




	If the Market Measure consists of a Basket, the Observation Levels, if applicable, and the
	Ending Value of the Basket will be determined as described in Basket Market Measures.




	The
	

	calculation day

	 means a trading day shortly before the maturity date. The calculation day will be set forth in the term sheet.




	A 

	trading day

	 means a day on which trading is generally conducted (or was scheduled to have been generally conducted, but for the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event) on the New
	York Stock Exchange (the 

	NYSE

	), the NASDAQ Stock Market, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and in the over-the-counter market for equity securities in the United States, or any successor exchange or market, or in the case of a
	security traded on one or more non-U.S. securities exchanges or markets, on the principal

	non-U.S.

	securities exchange or market for such security.




	The 

	Closing Market Price

	 for one share of any Underlying Stock (or one unit of any other security for which a Closing
	Market Price must be determined) on any trading day means any of the following:



	 





	 




	




	 





	if the Underlying Stock (or such other security) is listed or admitted to trading on a national securities exchange, the last reported sale price,
	regular way (or, in the case of The NASDAQ Stock Market, the official closing price), of the principal trading session on that day on the principal U.S. securities exchange registered under the Exchange Act on which the Underlying Stock (or such
	other security) is listed or admitted to trading;






	 





	 




	




	 





	if the Underlying Stock (or such other security) is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange but is included in the OTC
	Bulletin Board, the last reported sale price of the principal trading session on the OTC Bulletin Board on that day;






	 





	 




	




	 





	if the Underlying Stock (or such other security) is issued by a foreign issuer and its closing price cannot be determined as set forth in the two
	bullet points above, and the Underlying Stock (or such other security) is listed or admitted to trading on a non-U.S. securities exchange or market, the last reported sale price, regular way, of the principal trading session on that day on the
	primary non-U.S. securities exchange or market on which the Underlying Stock (or such other security) is listed or admitted to trading (converted to U.S. dollars using such exchange rate as the calculation agent, in its sole discretion, determines
	to be commercially reasonable); or






	 





	 




	




	 





	if the Closing Market Price cannot be determined as set forth in the prior bullets, the mean, as determined by the calculation agent, of the bid prices
	for the Underlying Stock (or such other security) obtained from as many dealers in that security (which may







	 




	PS-20







	Table of Contents






	 





	include us, MLPF&S and/or any of our other affiliates), but not exceeding three, as will make the bid prices available to the calculation agent. If no such bid price can be obtained, the
	Closing Market Price will be determined (or, if not determinable, estimated) by the calculation agent in its sole discretion in a commercially reasonable manner.







	If there is a Market Disruption Event on the scheduled calculation day, the calculation day will be the immediately succeeding trading
	day during which no Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing; provided that the Closing Market Price of the Underlying Stock for the calculation day will be determined (or, if not determinable, estimated) by the calculation agent in a
	commercially reasonable manner on a date no later than the second scheduled trading day prior to the maturity date, regardless of the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event on that day.




	The initial 

	Price Multiplier

	 for an Underlying Stock will be one, unless otherwise set forth in the applicable term
	sheet. The Price Multiplier will be subject to adjustment for certain corporate events relating to an Underlying Stock described below under Anti-Dilution Adjustments.





	Market Disruption Events





	As to any Underlying Stock, a 

	Market
	Disruption Event

	 means any of the following events, as determined by the calculation agent in its sole discretion:



	 





	 




	(A)




	the suspension of or material limitation of trading, in each case, for more than two consecutive hours of trading, or during the one-half hour period preceding the
	close of trading, of the shares of the Underlying Stock (or the successor to the Underlying Stock) on the primary exchange where such shares trade, as determined by the calculation agent (without taking into account any extended or after-hours
	trading session);





	 





	 




	(B)




	the suspension of or material limitation of trading, in each case, for more than two consecutive hours of trading, or during the one-half hour period preceding the
	close of trading, on the primary exchange that trades options contracts or futures contracts related to the shares of the Underlying Stock (or successor to the Underlying Stock) as determined by the calculation agent (without taking into account any
	extended or after-hours trading session), in options contracts or futures contracts related to the shares of the Underlying Stock; or





	 





	 




	(C)




	the determination that a scheduled Observation Date, if applicable, or the scheduled calculation day is not a trading day by reason of an extraordinary event,
	occurrence, declaration, or otherwise.






	For the purpose of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has
	occurred:



	 





	 




	(1)




	a limitation on the hours in a trading day and/or number of days of trading will not constitute a Market Disruption Event if it results from an announced change in the
	regular business hours of the relevant exchange;





	 





	 




	(2)




	a decision to permanently discontinue trading in the shares of the Underlying Stock (or successor Underlying Stock) or the relevant futures or options contracts
	relating to such shares will not constitute a Market Disruption Event;






	 




	PS-21







	Table of Contents






	 




	(3)




	a suspension in trading in a futures or options contract on the shares of the Underlying Stock (or successor Underlying Stock), by a major securities market by reason
	of (a) a price change violating limits set by that securities market, (b) an imbalance of orders relating to those contracts, or (c) a disparity in bid and ask quotes relating to those contracts, will each constitute a suspension of
	or material limitation on trading in futures or options contracts relating to the Underlying Stock;





	 





	 




	(4)




	subject to paragraph (3) above, a suspension of or material limitation on trading on the relevant exchange will not include any time when that exchange is closed
	for trading under ordinary circumstances; and





	 





	 




	(5)




	for the purpose of clause (A) above, any limitations on trading during significant market fluctuations under NYSE Rule 80B, or any applicable rule or
	regulation enacted or promulgated by the NYSE or any other

	self-regulatory

	organization or the SEC of similar scope as determined by the calculation agent, will be considered material.







	Anti-Dilution Adjustments





	As to any Underlying Stock, the calculation agent, in its sole discretion, may adjust the Price Multiplier (and as a result, the relevant Observation Level, if applicable, and the Ending Value), and any
	other terms of the notes (such as the Starting Value), if an event described below occurs after the pricing date and on or before the calculation day and if the calculation agent determines that such an event has a diluting or concentrative effect
	on the theoretical value of the shares of the Underlying Stock or successor Underlying Stock.




	The Price Multiplier resulting
	from any of the adjustments specified below will be rounded to the eighth decimal place with five one-billionths being rounded upward. No adjustments to the Price Multiplier will be required unless the adjustment would require a change of at least
	0.1% in the Price Multiplier then in effect. Any adjustment that would require a change of less than 0.1% in the Price Multiplier which is not applied at the time of the event may be reflected at the time of any subsequent adjustment that would
	require a change of the Price Multiplier. The required adjustments specified below do not cover all events that could affect the Underlying Stock.




	No adjustments to the Price Multiplier or any other terms of the notes will be required other than those specified below. However, the calculation agent may, at its sole discretion, make additional
	adjustments to the Price Multiplier or any other terms of the notes to reflect changes to the Underlying Stock if the calculation agent determines that the adjustment is appropriate to ensure an equitable result.




	The calculation agent will be solely responsible for the determination of any adjustments to the Price Multiplier or any other terms of
	the notes and of any related determinations with respect to any distributions of stock, other securities or other property or assets, including cash, in connection with any corporate event described below; its determinations and calculations will be
	conclusive absent a determination of a manifest error.




	No adjustments are required to be made for certain other events, such
	as offerings of common equity securities by the Underlying Company for cash or in connection with the occurrence of a partial tender or exchange offer for the Underlying Stock by the Underlying Company.




	 




	PS-22







	Table of Contents




	Following an event that results in an adjustment to the Price Multiplier or any of the other
	terms of the notes, the calculation agent may (but is not required to) provide holders of the notes with information about that adjustment as it deems appropriate, depending on the nature of the adjustment. Upon written request by any holder of the
	notes, the calculation agent will provide that holder with information about such adjustment.





	Anti-Dilution Adjustments to
	Underlying Stocks that Are Common Equity





	The calculation agent, in its sole discretion and as it deems reasonable, may
	adjust the Price Multiplier and other terms of the notes, and hence the Ending Value and, if applicable, an Observation Level, as a result of certain events related to an Underlying Stock, which include, but are not limited to, the following:





	Stock Splits and Reverse Stock Splits.

	If an Underlying Stock is subject to a stock split or reverse stock split, then
	once such split has become effective, the Price Multiplier will be adjusted such that the new Price Multiplier will equal the product of:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the prior Price Multiplier; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the number of shares that a holder of one share of the Underlying Stock before the effective date of the stock split or reverse stock split would have
	owned immediately following the applicable effective date.







	For example, a two-for-one stock split would
	ordinarily change a Price Multiplier of one into a Price Multiplier of two. In contrast, a one-for-two reverse stock split would ordinarily change a Price Multiplier of one into a Price Multiplier of one-half.





	Stock Dividends.

	If an Underlying Stock is subject to (i) a stock dividend (i.e., an issuance of additional shares of
	Underlying Stock) that is given ratably to all holders of the Underlying Stock or (ii) a distribution of additional shares of the Underlying Stock as a result of the triggering of any provision of the organizational documents of the Underlying
	Company, then, once the dividend has become effective and the Underlying Stock is trading ex-dividend, the Price Multiplier will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date such that the new Price Multiplier will equal the prior Price Multiplier

	plus

	the product of:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the prior Price Multiplier; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the number of additional shares issued in the stock dividend with respect to one share of the Underlying Stock;







	provided that no adjustment will be made for a stock dividend for which the number of shares of the Underlying Stock paid or distributed is based on a
	fixed cash equivalent value, unless such distribution is an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below).




	For example, a stock
	dividend of one new share for each share held would ordinarily change a Price Multiplier of one into a Price Multiplier of two.





	Extraordinary Dividends.

	There will be no adjustments to the Price Multiplier to reflect any cash dividends or cash distributions
	paid with respect to an Underlying Stock other than Extraordinary Dividends, as described below, and distributions described under the section entitled Reorganization Events below.




	 




	PS-23







	Table of Contents




	An 

	Extraordinary Dividend

	 means, with respect to a cash dividend or other
	distribution with respect to an Underlying Stock, a dividend or other distribution that the calculation agent determines, in its sole discretion, is not declared or otherwise made according to the Underlying Companys then existing policy or
	practice of paying such dividends on a quarterly or other regular basis. If an Extraordinary Dividend occurs, the Price Multiplier will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date so that the new Price Multiplier will equal the product of:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the prior Price Multiplier; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Market Price per share of the Underlying Stock on the trading day preceding the ex-dividend date and
	the denominator of which is the amount by which the Closing Market Price per share of the Underlying Stock on that preceding trading day exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount.







	The 

	Extraordinary Dividend Amount

	 with respect to an Extraordinary Dividend will equal:



	 





	 




	




	 





	in the case of cash dividends or other distributions that constitute regular dividends, the amount per share of the Underlying Stock of that
	Extraordinary Dividend minus the amount per share of the immediately preceding non-Extraordinary Dividend for that share; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	in the case of cash dividends or other distributions that do not constitute regular dividends, the amount per share of the Underlying Stock of that
	Extraordinary Dividend.







	To the extent an Extraordinary Dividend is not paid in cash, the value of the
	non-cash component will be determined by the calculation agent, whose determination will be conclusive. A distribution on the Underlying Stock described in the section Issuance of Transferable Rights or Warrants or
	clause (a), (d) or (e) of the section entitled Reorganization Events below that also constitutes an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment under those respective sections.





	Issuance of Transferable Rights or Warrants.

	If an Underlying Company issues transferable rights or warrants to all holders of
	record of the Underlying Stock to subscribe for or purchase the Underlying Stock, including new or existing rights to purchase the Underlying Stock under a shareholder rights plan or arrangement, then the Price Multiplier will be adjusted on the
	trading day immediately following the issuance of those transferable rights or warrants so that the new Price Multiplier will equal the prior Price Multiplier plus the product of:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the prior Price Multiplier; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the number of shares of the Underlying Stock that can be purchased with the cash value of those warrants or rights distributed on one share of the
	Underlying Stock.







	 




	PS-24







	Table of Contents




	The number of shares that can be purchased will be based on the Closing Market Price of the
	Underlying Stock on the date the new Price Multiplier is determined. The cash value of those warrants or rights, if the warrants or rights are traded on a registered national securities exchange, will equal the closing price of that warrant or
	right. If the warrants or rights are not traded on a registered national securities exchange, the cash value will be determined by the calculation agent and will equal the average of the bid prices obtained from three dealers at 3:00 p.m., New York
	time on the date the new Price Multiplier is determined, provided that if only two of those bid prices are available, then the cash value of those warrants or rights will equal the average of those bids and if only one of those bids is available,
	then the cash value of those warrants or rights will equal that bid.





	Reorganization Events





	If after the pricing date and on or prior to the calculation day, as to any Underlying Stock:



	 





	 




	(a)




	there occurs any reclassification or change of the Underlying Stock, including, without limitation, as a result of the issuance of tracking stock by the Underlying
	Company;





	 





	 




	(b)




	the Underlying Company, or any surviving entity or subsequent surviving entity of the Underlying Company (a 

	Successor Entity

	), has been subject to a
	merger, combination, or consolidation and is not the surviving entity;





	 





	 




	(c)




	any statutory exchange of securities of the Underlying Company or any Successor Entity with another corporation occurs, other than under clause (b) above;





	 





	 




	(d)




	the Underlying Company is liquidated or is subject to a proceeding under any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, or other similar law;





	 





	 




	(e)




	the Underlying Company issues to all of its shareholders securities of an issuer other than the Underlying Company, including equity securities of an affiliate of the
	Underlying Company, other than in a transaction described in clauses (b), (c), or (d) above;





	 





	 




	(f)




	a tender or exchange offer or going-private transaction is consummated for all the outstanding shares of the Underlying Company;





	 





	 




	(g)




	there occurs any reclassification or change of the Underlying Stock that results in a transfer or an irrevocable commitment to transfer all such outstanding shares of
	the Underlying Stock to another entity or person;





	 





	 




	(h)




	the Underlying Company or any Successor Entity is the surviving entity of a merger, combination, or consolidation, that results in the outstanding Underlying Stock
	(other than Underlying Stock owned or controlled by the other party to such transaction) immediately prior to such event collectively representing less than 50% of the outstanding Underlying Stock immediately following such event; or





	 





	 




	(i)




	the Underlying Company ceases to file the financial and other information with the SEC in accordance with Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act (an event in clauses
	(a) through (i), a 

	Reorganization Event

	),






	 




	PS-25







	Table of Contents




	then, on or after the date of the occurrence of a Reorganization Event, the calculation agent shall, in its
	sole discretion, make an adjustment to the Price Multiplier or any other terms of the notes as the calculation agent, in its sole discretion, determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on the notes of that Reorganization Event
	(including adjustments to account for changes in volatility, expected dividends, stock loan rate, or liquidity relevant to the Underlying Stock or to the notes), which may, but need not, be determined by reference to the adjustment(s) made in
	respect of such Reorganization Event by an options exchange to options on the relevant Underlying Stock traded on that options exchange and determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the calculation agent determines that no adjustment that
	it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the calculation agent may cause the maturity date of the notes to be accelerated to the fifth business day following the date of that determination and the amount payable to you on
	the notes will be calculated as though the date of early repayment were the stated maturity date of the notes and as though the calculation day were the fifth trading day prior to the date of acceleration.




	If the Underlying Company ceases to file the financial and other information with the SEC in accordance with Section 13(a) of the
	Exchange Act, as contemplated by clause (i) above, and the calculation agent determines in its sole discretion that sufficiently similar information is not otherwise available to you, then the calculation agent may cause the maturity date of
	the notes to be accelerated to the fifth business day following the date of that determination and the amount payable to you on the notes will be calculated as though the date of early repayment were the stated maturity date of the notes, and as
	though the calculation day were the fifth trading day prior to the date of acceleration. If the calculation agent determines that sufficiently similar information is available to you, the Reorganization Event will be deemed to have not occurred.





	Alternative Anti-Dilution and Reorganization Adjustments





	The calculation agent may elect at its discretion to not make any of the adjustments to the Price Multiplier or to the other terms of the
	notes described in this section, but may instead make adjustments, in its discretion, to the Price Multiplier or any other terms of the notes (such as the Starting Value and if applicable, the Call Level) that will reflect the adjustments to the
	extent practicable made by the Options Clearing Corporation on options contracts on an Underlying Stock or any successor common stock. For example, if the Underlying Stock is subject to a two-for-one stock split, and the Options Clearing Corporation
	adjusts the strike prices of the options contract on the Underlying Stock by dividing the strike price by two, then the calculation agent may also elect to divide the Starting Value by two. In this case, the Price Multiplier will remain one. This
	adjustment would have the same economic effect on holders of the notes as if the Price Multiplier had been adjusted.





	Anti-Dilution
	Adjustments to Underlying Stocks that Are ADRs





	For purposes of the anti-dilution adjustments set forth above, if an
	Underlying Stock is an ADR (an 

	Underlying ADR

	), the calculation agent will consider the effect of any of the relevant events on the Underlying ADR, and adjustments will be made as if the Underlying ADR was the Underlying Stock
	described above. For example, if the stock represented by the Underlying ADR is subject to a two-for-one stock split, and assuming an initial Price Multiplier of 1, the Price Multiplier for the Underlying ADR would be adjusted so that it equals two.
	Unless otherwise specified in the applicable term sheet, with respect to the notes linked to an Underlying ADR (or an Underlying Stock issued by a non-U.S. Underlying Company), the term dividend means the dividends paid to holders of the
	Underlying ADR (or the Underlying Stock issued by the non-U.S. Underlying Company), and such dividends may reflect the netting of




	 




	PS-26







	Table of Contents




	any applicable foreign withholding or similar taxes that may be due on dividends paid to a U.S. person.




	The calculation agent may determine not to make an adjustment if:



	 





	 




	(A)




	holders of the Underlying ADR are not eligible to participate in any of the events that would otherwise require anti-dilution adjustments as set forth above if the
	notes had been linked directly to the common shares of the Underlying Company represented by the Underlying ADR; or





	 





	 




	(B)




	to the extent that the calculation agent determines that the Underlying Company or the depositary for the ADRs has adjusted the number of common shares of the
	Underlying Company represented by each share of the Underlying ADR, so that the market price of the Underlying ADR would not be affected by the corporate event.






	If the Underlying Company or the depositary for the ADRs, in the absence of any of the events described above, elects to adjust the number of common shares of the Underlying Company represented by each
	share of the Underlying ADR, then the calculation agent may make the appropriate anti-dilution adjustments to reflect such change. The depositary for the ADRs may also make adjustments in respect of the ADRs for share distributions, rights
	distributions, cash distributions and distributions other than shares, rights, and cash. Upon any such adjustment by the depositary, the calculation agent may adjust the Price Multiplier or other terms of the notes as the calculation agent
	determines commercially reasonable to account for that event.





	Delisting of ADRs or Termination of ADR Facility





	If an Underlying ADR is no longer listed or admitted to trading on a U.S. securities exchange registered under the Exchange Act or
	included in the OTC Bulletin Board Service operated by FINRA, or if the ADR facility between the Underlying Company and the ADR depositary is terminated for any reason, then, on and after the date that the Underlying ADR is no longer so listed or
	admitted to trading or the date of such termination, as applicable (the 

	termination date

	), the Market Measure for the notes will be deemed to be the Underlying Companys common equity securities rather than the Underlying
	ADR. The calculation agent will determine the price of the Market Measure by reference to those common shares. Under such circumstances, the calculation agent may modify any terms of the notes as it deems necessary, in its sole discretion, to ensure
	an equitable result. On and after the termination date, for all purposes, the Closing Market Price of the Underlying Companys common shares on their primary exchange will be converted to U.S. dollars using such exchange rate as the calculation
	agent, in its sole discretion, determines to be commercially reasonable.





	Underlying Stock





	Any information regarding any Underlying Stock or any Underlying Company will be derived from publicly available documents. Any
	Underlying Stock will be registered under the Exchange Act. Information provided to or filed with the SEC by any Underlying Company can be located at the SECs facilities or through the SECs website, www.sec.gov. Neither we nor any
	selling agent will have independently verified the accuracy or completeness of any of the information or reports of an Underlying Company.




	The selection of an Underlying Stock is not a recommendation to buy or sell the Underlying Stock. Neither we nor any of our subsidiaries or affiliates makes any representation to any purchaser of the
	notes as to the performance of any Underlying Stock.

	Basket Market Measures





	If the Market Measure to which your notes are linked is a Basket, the Basket Stocks will be set forth in the term sheet. We will assign each Basket Stock a weighting (the 

	Initial Component
	Weight

	) so that each Basket Stock represents a percentage of the Starting Value of the Basket on the pricing date. We may assign the Basket Stocks equal Initial Component Weights, or we may assign the Basket Stocks unequal Initial
	Component Weights. The Initial Component Weight for each Basket Stock will be stated in the term sheet.





	Determination of
	the Component Ratio for Each Basket Stock





	The 

	Starting Value

	 of the Basket will be equal to 100. We
	will set a fixed factor (the 

	Component Ratio

	) for each Basket Stock on the pricing date, based upon the weighting of that Basket Stock. The Component Ratio for each Basket Stock will equal:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the Initial Component Weight (expressed as a percentage) for that Basket Stock, multiplied by 100;

	divided by







	 





	 




	




	 





	the Closing Market Price of that Basket Stock on the pricing date.







	Each Component Ratio will be rounded to eight decimal places.




	The Component Ratios will be calculated in this way so that the Starting Value of the Basket will equal 100 on the pricing date. The Component Ratios will not be revised subsequent to their determination
	on the pricing date, except that the calculation agent may in its good faith judgment adjust the Component Ratio of any Basket Stock in the event that Basket Stock is materially changed or modified in a manner that does not, in the opinion of the
	calculation agent, fairly represent the value of that Basket Stock had those material changes or modifications not been made.




	The following table is for illustration purposes only, and does not reflect the actual composition, Initial Component Weights, or
	Component Ratios, which will be set forth in the term sheet.

	This column sets forth the

	hypothetical

	Closing Market Price of each Basket Stock on the

	hypothetical

	pricing date.








	(2)




	The

	hypothetical

	Component Ratio for each Basket Stock equals its Initial Component Weight (expressed as a percentage) multiplied by 100, and then divided
	by the Closing Market Price of that Basket Stock on the

	hypothetical

	pricing date, with the result rounded to eight decimal places.







	Observation Level or Ending Value of the Basket





	The 

	Ending
	Value

	 of the Basket will be the value of the Basket on the calculation day and, if applicable, the 

	Observation Level

	 of the Basket will be the value of the Basket on the relevant Observation Date. The value of the Basket
	will equal the sum of the products of the Closing Market Price of each Basket Stock on a trading day multiplied by its Price Multiplier on that day, and the Component Ratio for each Basket Stock. The value of the Basket will vary based on the
	increase or decrease in the price of each Basket Stock. Any increase in the price of a Basket Stock (assuming no change in the price of the other Basket Stock or Basket Stocks) will result in an increase in the value of the Basket. Conversely, any
	decrease in the price of a Basket Stock (assuming no change in the price of the other Basket Stock or Basket Stocks) will result in a decrease in the value of the Basket.




	Unless otherwise specified in the term sheet, if, for any Basket Stock (an 

	Affected Basket Stock

	), a Market Disruption Event occurs on the scheduled calculation day or, if applicable,
	on an Observation Date (in either case, such day being a 

	non-calculation day

	), the calculation agent will determine the prices of the Basket Stocks for that non-calculation day, and as a result, the Ending Value or, the relevant
	Observation Level, if applicable, as follows:



	 





	 




	




	 





	The Closing Market Price of each Basket Stock that is not an Affected Basket Stock will be its Closing Market Price on that non-calculation day.






	 





	 




	




	 





	The Closing Market Price of each Basket Stock that is an Affected Basket Stock for the applicable non-calculation day will be determined in the same
	manner as described in the second to last paragraph of subsection Automatic Call or The Starting Value, the Observation Level and the Ending ValueEnding Value, as applicable, provided that references to
	Underlying Stock will be references to Basket Stock.







	 




	PS-29







	Table of Contents




	For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred as to any Basket
	Stock, Market Disruption Event will have the meaning stated above in Market Disruption Events.





	Role of the
	Calculation Agent





	The calculation agent has the sole discretion to make all determinations regarding the notes as
	described in this product supplement, including determinations regarding the Starting Value, the Step Up Value, the Threshold Value, the Ending Value, the Price Multiplier, the Closing Market Price, the Redemption Amount, any Market Disruption
	Events, a successor Underlying Stock, business days, trading days, non-calculation days, and if applicable, the Call Level, the Observation Level of the Market Measure on each Observation Date, and whether the notes will be called. Absent manifest
	error, all determinations of the calculation agent will be conclusive for all purposes and final and binding on you and us, without any liability on the part of the calculation agent.




	We expect to appoint MLPF&S or one of our other affiliates as the calculation agent for each issue of the notes. However, we may
	change the calculation agent at any time without notifying you. The identity of the calculation agent will be set forth in the applicable term sheet.





	Same-Day Settlement and Payment





	The notes will be delivered in book-entry
	form only through The Depository Trust Company against payment by purchasers of the notes in immediately available funds. We will pay the amounts payable on the notes in immediately available funds so long as the notes are maintained in book-entry
	form.





	Events of Default and Acceleration





	Events of default are defined in the Senior Indenture. Subject to the provisions of the following paragraph, if such event occurs and is continuing, unless otherwise stated in the term sheet, the amount
	payable to a holder of the notes upon any acceleration permitted under the Senior Indenture will be equal to the payment described under the caption Payment at Maturity, determined as if the date of acceleration were the maturity
	date of the notes and as if the fifth trading day prior to the date of acceleration were the calculation day.




	If the notes
	are subject to an automatic call, and an event of default occurs on or prior to the final Observation Date (i.e., not during the period from after that Observation Date to the original maturity date of the notes), then the payment on the notes will
	be determined as described under the caption Automatic Call, as if the next scheduled Observation Date were five trading days prior to the date of acceleration; provided that the applicable Observation Level as of that date is
	greater than or equal to the Call Level. In such a case, the calculation agent shall pro-rate the applicable Call Premium and Call Amount according to the period of time elapsed between the settlement date of the notes and the date of acceleration.
	For the avoidance of doubt, if the Observation Level of the Market Measure as of that date is less than the Call Level, the payment on the notes will be calculated as set forth in the prior paragraph.




	If a bankruptcy proceeding is commenced in respect of us, your claim may be limited under applicable bankruptcy law. In case of a
	default in payment of the notes, whether at their maturity or upon acceleration, they will not bear a default interest rate.

	SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION





	One or more of our affiliates may act as our selling agent for any offering of the notes. The selling agents may act on either a
	principal basis or an agency basis, as set forth in the applicable term sheet. Each selling agent will be a party to a distribution agreement described in the Supplemental Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest) beginning on page
	S-15 of the accompanying prospectus supplement.




	Each selling agent will receive an underwriting discount or commission that
	is a percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the notes sold through its efforts, which will be set forth in the applicable term sheet. You must have an account with the applicable selling agent in order to purchase the notes.




	None of the selling agents is acting as your fiduciary or advisor solely as a result of the making of any offering of the notes, and you
	should not rely upon this product supplement, the term sheet, or the accompanying prospectus or prospectus supplement as investment advice or a recommendation to purchase any notes. You should make your own investment decision regarding the notes
	after consulting with your legal, tax, and other advisors.




	MLPF&S and any of our other affiliates may use this product
	supplement, the prospectus supplement, and the prospectus, together with the applicable term sheet, in a market-making transaction for any notes after their initial sale.

	U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX SUMMARY





	The following summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations of the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of the notes
	is based upon the advice of Morrison & Foerster LLP, our tax counsel. The following discussion supplements, and to the extent inconsistent supersedes, the discussions under U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations in the
	accompanying prospectus and under U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations in the accompanying prospectus supplement and is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
	amended (the 

	Code

	), regulations promulgated under the Code by the U.S. Treasury Department (

	Treasury

	) (including proposed and temporary regulations), rulings, current administrative interpretations and official
	pronouncements of the IRS, and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that
	a court would not sustain, a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below. This summary does not include any description of the tax laws of any state or local governments, or of any foreign government, that may be applicable to a
	particular holder. If the tax consequences associated with the notes are different than those described below, they will be described in the applicable term sheet.




	This summary is directed solely to U.S. Holders and Non-U.S. Holders that, except as otherwise specifically noted, will purchase the notes upon original issuance and will hold the notes as capital assets
	within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code, which generally means property held for investment, and that are not excluded from the discussion under U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations in the accompanying prospectus.





	You should consult your own tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring, owning,
	and disposing of the notes, as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local, foreign, or other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or other tax laws.






	General





	Although there
	is no statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addressing the characterization of the notes, we intend to treat the notes for all tax purposes as single financial contracts with respect to the Market Measure and under the terms of
	the notes, we and every investor in the notes agree, in the absence of an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary, to treat the notes in accordance with such characterization. This discussion assumes that the notes constitute
	single financial contracts with respect to the Market Measure for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the notes did not constitute single financial contracts, the tax consequences described below would be materially different.





	This characterization of the notes is not binding on the IRS or the courts. No statutory, judicial, or administrative authority
	directly addresses the characterization of the notes or any similar instruments for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and no ruling is being requested from the IRS with respect to their proper characterization and treatment. Due to the absence of
	authorities on point, significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes are not certain, and no assurance can be given that the IRS or any court will agree with the characterization and tax treatment
	described in this product supplement. Accordingly, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the notes, including possible alternative characterizations.





	 




	PS-33







	Table of Contents




	Unless otherwise stated, the following discussion is based on the characterization described
	above. The discussion in this section assumes that there is a significant possibility of a significant loss of principal on an investment in the notes.




	We will not attempt to ascertain whether the issuer of any Underlying Stock would be treated as a passive foreign investment company (

	PFIC

	), within the meaning of
	Section 1297 of the Code, or a United States real property holding corporation, within the meaning of Section 897(c) of the Code. If the issuer of any Underlying Stock were so treated, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences
	could possibly apply to a holder of the notes. You should refer to information filed with the SEC by the issuer of any Underlying Stock and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you, if any, if the issuer of any Underlying
	Stock is or becomes a PFIC or is or becomes a United States real property holding corporation.





	U.S. Holders





	Upon receipt of a cash payment at maturity or upon a sale, call or exchange of the notes prior to maturity, a U.S. Holder generally will
	recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the U.S. Holders tax basis in the notes. A U.S. Holders tax basis in the notes will equal the amount paid by that holder to acquire them. This capital
	gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder held the notes for more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.





	Alternative Tax Treatments

	. Due to the absence of authorities that directly address the proper tax treatment of the notes,
	prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding all possible alternative tax treatments of an investment in the notes. In particular, if the notes have a term that exceeds one year, the IRS could seek to subject the notes to
	the Treasury regulations governing contingent payment debt instruments. If the IRS were successful in that regard, the timing and character of income on the notes would be affected significantly. Among other things, a U.S. Holder would be required
	to accrue original issue discount every year at a comparable yield determined at the time of issuance. In addition, any gain realized by a U.S. Holder at maturity, or upon a sale, call or exchange, of the notes generally would be treated
	as ordinary income, and any loss realized at maturity would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the U.S. Holders prior accruals of original issue discount, and as capital loss thereafter. If the notes have a term of one year or less,
	a U.S. Holder who uses the accrual method of accounting generally should be required to accrue any original issue discount on the notes on a straight-line basis. At maturity, or upon a sale, call or exchange, a U.S. Holder using either a cash or
	accrual method of accounting generally should recognize taxable gain (all or a portion of which may be treated as ordinary income) or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and such holders tax basis in the
	notes.




	The IRS released Notice 2008-2 (

	Notice

	) which sought comments from the public on the taxation of
	financial instruments currently taxed as prepaid forward contracts. This Notice addresses instruments such as the notes. According to the Notice, the IRS and Treasury are considering whether a holder of an instrument such as the notes
	should be required to accrue ordinary income on a current basis, regardless of whether any payments are made prior to maturity. It is not possible to determine what guidance the IRS and Treasury will ultimately issue, if any. Any such future
	guidance may affect the amount, timing and character of income, gain, or loss in respect of the notes, possibly with retroactive effect.




	The IRS and Treasury are also considering additional issues, including whether additional gain or loss from such instruments should be treated as ordinary or capital, whether




	 




	PS-34







	Table of Contents




	foreign holders of such instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals, whether Section 1260 of the Code, concerning certain constructive ownership
	transactions, generally applies or should generally apply to such instruments, and whether any of these determinations depend on the nature of the underlying asset.




	In addition, proposed Treasury regulations require the accrual of income on a current basis for contingent payments made under certain notional principal contracts. The preamble to the regulations states
	that the wait and see method of accounting does not properly reflect the economic accrual of income on those contracts, and requires current accrual of income for some contracts already in existence. While the proposed regulations do not
	apply to prepaid forward contracts, the preamble to the proposed regulations expresses the view that similar timing issues exist in the case of prepaid forward contracts. If the IRS or Treasury publishes future guidance requiring current economic
	accrual for contingent payments on prepaid forward contracts, it is possible that you could be required to accrue income over the term of the notes.




	Because of the absence of authority regarding the appropriate tax characterization of the notes, it is also possible that the IRS could seek to characterize the notes in a manner that results in tax
	consequences that are different from those described above. For example, the IRS could possibly assert that any gain or loss that a holder may recognize at maturity or upon sale or exchange of the notes should be treated as ordinary.




	It is possible that the IRS could assert that a U.S. Holders holding period in respect of the notes should end on the applicable
	calculation day, even though such holder will not receive any amounts in respect of the notes prior to the redemption or maturity of the notes. In such case, if the applicable calculation day is not in excess of one year from the original issue
	date, a U.S. Holder may be treated as having a holding period in respect of the notes equal to one year or less, in which case any gain or loss such holder recognizes at such time would be treated as short-term capital gain or loss.





	Non-U.S. Holders





	A
	Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax on any gain from the sale or exchange or the notes or their settlement at maturity, provided that the Non-U.S. Holder complies with applicable certification
	requirements and that the payment is not effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Holder of a U.S. trade or business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, gain from the sale or exchange of the notes or their settlement at maturity may be
	subject to U.S. federal income tax if that Non-U.S. Holder is a non-resident alien individual and is present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the settlement at maturity, sale, call or exchange and certain other conditions
	are satisfied.




	If a Non-U.S. Holder of the notes is engaged in the conduct of a trade or business within the U.S. and if gain
	realized on the settlement at maturity, sale or exchange of the notes, is effectively connected with the conduct of such trade or business (and, if certain tax treaties apply, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-U.S.
	Holder in the U.S.), the Non-U.S. Holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such gain on a net income basis in the same manner as if it were a U.S. Holder. Such Non-U.S. Holders should read the material under the heading
	U.S. Holders, for a description of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the notes. In addition, if such Non-U.S. Holder is a foreign corporation, it may also be subject to a branch profits
	tax equal to 30% (or such lower rate provided by any applicable tax treaty) of a portion of its




	 




	PS-35







	Table of Contents




	earnings and profits for the taxable year that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the U.S., subject to certain adjustments.




	A dividend equivalent payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the U.S. and such payments generally would be
	subject to a 30% (or a lower rate under an applicable treaty) U.S. withholding tax if paid to a Non-U.S. Holder. Under Treasury regulations, certain payments (including deemed payments) that are contingent upon or determined by reference to actual
	or estimated U.S. source dividends with respect to certain equity-linked instruments, whether explicitly stated or implicitly taken into account in computing one or more of the terms of such instruments, may be treated as dividend equivalents.
	However, this withholding on dividend equivalent payments, if any, will not apply to equity-linked instruments issued before January 1, 2016. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding, we (or the
	applicable paying agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.




	As discussed above, alternative characterizations of the notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes are possible. Should an alternative characterization, by reason of change or clarification of the law,
	by regulation or otherwise, cause payments as to the notes to become subject to withholding tax, we will withhold tax at the applicable statutory rate. As discussed above, the IRS has indicated in the Notice that it is considering whether income in
	respect of instruments such as the notes should be subject to withholding tax. Prospective Non-U.S. Holders of the notes should consult their own tax advisors in this regard.





	U.S. Federal Estate Tax.

	Under current law, while the matter is not entirely clear, individual Non-U.S. Holders, and entities whose property is potentially includible in those individuals
	gross estates for U.S. federal estate tax purposes (for example, a trust funded by such an individual and with respect to which the individual has retained certain interests or powers), should note that, absent an applicable treaty benefit, the
	notes are likely to be treated as U.S. situs property, subject to U.S. federal estate tax. These individuals and entities should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal estate tax consequences of investing in the notes.





	Backup Withholding and Information Reporting





	Please see the discussion under U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations  Taxation of Debt Securities  Backup Withholding and Information Reporting in the accompanying prospectus for
	a description of the applicability of the backup withholding and information reporting rules to payments made on the notes.





	Foreign
	Account Tax Compliance Act





	The IRS has announced that withholding under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (as
	discussed in the prospectus supplement) on payments of gross proceeds from a sale or redemption of the notes will only apply to payments made after December 31, 2018.

	ERISA CONSIDERATIONS





	Each fiduciary of a pension, profit-sharing, or other employee benefit plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
	1974 (

	ERISA

	) (a 

	Plan

	), should consider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in the context of the Plans particular circumstances before authorizing an investment in the notes. Accordingly, among other factors,
	the fiduciary should consider whether the investment would satisfy the prudence and diversification requirements of ERISA and would be consistent with the documents and instruments governing the Plan.




	The fiduciary investment considerations summarized above generally apply to employee benefit plans maintained by private-sector employers
	and to individual retirement accounts and other arrangements subject to Section 4975 of the Code, but generally do not apply to governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA), certain church plans (as defined in
	Section 3(33) of ERISA), and foreign plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA). However, these other plans may be subject to similar provisions under applicable federal, state, local, foreign, or other regulations, rules, or laws
	(

	similar laws

	). The fiduciaries of plans subject to similar laws should also consider the foregoing issues in general terms as well as any further issues arising under the applicable similar laws.




	In addition, we and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates may be each considered a party in interest within the meaning of ERISA, or
	a disqualified person (within the meaning of the Code), with respect to many Plans, as well as many individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans (also 

	Plans

	). Prohibited transactions within the meaning of ERISA or the Code would
	likely arise, for example, if the notes are acquired by or with the assets of a Plan with respect to which we or any of our affiliates is a party in interest, unless the notes are acquired under an exemption from the prohibited transaction rules. A
	violation of these prohibited transaction rules could result in an excise tax or other liabilities under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code for such persons, unless exemptive relief is available under an applicable statutory or
	administrative exemption.




	Under ERISA and various prohibited transaction class exemptions (

	PTCEs

	) issued
	by the U.S. Department of Labor, exemptive relief may be available for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the purchase, holding, or disposition of the notes. Those exemptions are PTCE 96-23 (for certain transactions determined
	by in-house asset managers), PTCE 95-60 (for certain transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTCE 91-38 (for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds), PTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions involving
	insurance company separate accounts), PTCE 84-14 (for certain transactions determined by independent qualified asset managers), and the exemption under Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code for certain
	arms-length transactions with a person that is a party in interest solely by reason of providing services to Plans or being an affiliate of such a service provider (the 

	Service Provider Exemption

	).




	Because we may be considered a party in interest with respect to many Plans, the notes may not be purchased, held, or disposed of by any
	Plan, any entity whose underlying assets include plan assets by reason of any Plans investment in the entity (a 

	Plan Asset Entity

	) or any person investing plan assets of any Plan, unless such purchase, holding, or
	disposition is eligible for exemptive relief, including relief available under PTCE 96-23, 95-60, 91-38, 90-1, or 84-14 or the Service Provider Exemption, or such purchase, holding, or disposition is otherwise not prohibited. Any purchaser,
	including any fiduciary purchasing on behalf of a Plan, transferee or holder of the notes will be deemed to have represented, in its corporate and its fiduciary capacity, by its purchase and holding of the notes that either (a) it is not a Plan
	or a Plan Asset Entity and is not purchasing such notes on behalf of or with plan assets of any Plan or any plan subject to similar laws or (b) its purchase, holding, and disposition are eligible for




	 




	PS-37







	Table of Contents




	exemptive relief or such purchase, holding, and disposition are not prohibited by ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or similar laws.




	Further, any person acquiring or holding the notes on behalf of any plan or with any plan assets shall be deemed to represent on behalf
	of itself and such plan that (x) the plan is paying no more than, and is receiving no less than, adequate consideration within the meaning of Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA in connection with the transaction or any redemption of the notes,
	(y) none of us, MLPF&S, or any other selling agent directly or indirectly exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders investment advice or otherwise acts in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the assets of the plan within
	the meaning of ERISA and (z) in making the foregoing representations and warranties, such person has applied sound business principles in determining whether fair market value will be paid, and has made such determination acting in good faith.




	In addition, any purchaser, that is a Plan or a Plan Asset Entity or that is acquiring the notes on behalf of a Plan or a
	Plan Asset Entity, including any fiduciary purchasing on behalf of a Plan or Plan Asset entity, will be deemed to have represented, in its corporate and its fiduciary capacity, by its purchase and holding of the notes that (a) none of us,
	MLPF&S, or any of our other affiliates is a 

	fiduciary

	 (under Section 3(21) of ERISA, or under any final or proposed regulations thereunder, or with respect to a governmental, church, or foreign plan under any similar
	laws) with respect to the acquisition, holding or disposition of the notes, or as a result of any exercise by us or our affiliates of any rights in connection with the notes, (b) no advice provided by us or any of our affiliates has formed a
	primary basis for any investment decision by or on behalf of such purchaser in connection with the notes and the transactions contemplated with respect to the notes, and (c) such purchaser recognizes and agrees that any communication from us or
	any of our affiliates to the purchaser with respect to the notes is not intended by us or any of our affiliates to be impartial investment advice and is rendered in its capacity as a seller of such notes and not a fiduciary to such purchaser.
	Purchasers of the notes have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase, holding, and disposition of the notes do not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or any similar regulations applicable to governmental
	or church plans, as described above.




	This discussion is a general summary of some of the rules which apply to benefit plans
	and their related investment vehicles. This summary does not include all of the investment considerations relevant to Plans and other benefit plan investors such as governmental, church, and foreign plans and should not be construed as legal advice
	or a legal opinion. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing the
	notes on behalf of or with plan assets of any Plan or other benefit plan investor consult with their legal counsel prior to directing any such purchase.

(1) Admin/Professional Fees may include, but are not limited to, postage,        
    telephone services, overnight delivery services, legal fees, accounting fees,
    costs to become a publicly reporting company and other general operating     
    expenses. Any line item amounts not expended completely shall be held in

    expenditures as required for ongoing operations.

The market for resale of sporting event tickets is constantly changing and may
have seasonal shifts and are highly dependent upon the performance of a given
team within their regional market. As such, it is difficult to determine
consistent projections for demand for ticket sales. Because of these
uncertainties, the Use of Proceeds, as laid forth above are general estimates
based upon our understanding of the current markets. As some sports seasons wind
down and others begin, we will adjust according to market demand. If demand is
low, we may have to allocate additional funds toward marketing and advertising.

The funds from this Offering will not be used to pay Zev Turetsky for his
services to the Company, whether provided prior to, during, or subsequent to the
Offering. There can be no assurance that the Company will raise any funds
through this Offering and if a limited amount of funds are raised, the Company
will use such funds according to their best judgment in accordance with the “Use
of Proceeds” chart. This discretion is not unlimited and any such change in the
use of proceeds as discussed above would be restricted to a proportionate
reduction in funds allocated to each specific item listed, and would not differ
materially from the “Use of Proceeds” chart above. To the extent our offering
proceeds do not cover any professional fees incurred by the Company, we
anticipate paying for any such expenses out of any additional funding or
revenues we receive.

If we require additional funding, we will seek such funds from friends, family,
and business acquaintances in order to continue our operations. As with any form
of financing, there are uncertainties concerning the availability of such funds
on terms acceptable to us, as we have not received any firm commitments or
indications of interest from our friends, family members, or business
acquaintances regarding potential investments in our Company.


Barrier to entry in the industry is extremely low and there are many
competitors. Before we launch our own website for the purpose of selling our
tickets, our primary competition will be other ticket resellers on StubHub. Once
we successfully launch our website, our competition will consist of companies
such as StubHub, Ticketliquidator.com, Ticketnetwork.com, Ticketsnow.com, and
Vividseats.com.

For events that fail to sell out, we will also compete with primary ticket
vendors, such as TicketMaster.

As a small company compared to some of our competitors, they have significantly
greater financial and marketing resources. They may have a greater advantage to
negotiate higher commissions because of their more recognizable brand. There are
no assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be successful.


Company Description
Zev Ventures, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 22, 2014.
The Company purchases sporting events tickets in bulk directly from ticket
vendors such as Ticketmaster and the sports franchises and sports associations
directly. The Company intends to focus primarily on tickets


 offered by the
following sports leagues: Major League Baseball (“MLB”), the National Basketball
Association (“NBA”), the National Hockey League (“NHL”), and the National
Football League (“NFL”). Teams in these leagues sell their tickets for below
market price in order to insure games are sold out and to maintain customer 
loyalty. We intend to capitalize on this market inefficiency by reselling
tickets purchased from primary vendors at the price actually commanded by the
market on StubHub, a ticket resale marketplace.
