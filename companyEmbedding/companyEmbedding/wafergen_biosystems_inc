We estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$18.00 million. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $20.76
million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

If our net proceeds from this offering exceed $15.0 million, we will be
contractually required to use approximately $1.3 million of the net proceeds
from this offering to repay a $1.25 million secured promissory note owing to
IntegenX Inc. (the “IntegenX Note”). We issued the IntegenX Note as part of the
purchase price for our January 2014 acquisition of IntegenX’s next generation
sequencing business, including the Apollo 324TM instrument and the PrepXTM
reagents.

We intend to use the rest of the net proceeds from this offering for general
corporate and working capital purposes, including commercialization activities
intended to increase revenues from sales of our target enrichment and other
products.


We believe the industry leaders in the markets in which we compete are LIFE,
Fluidigm Corporation, Illumina, Agilent Technologies, Inc. and PerkinElmer,
Inc.. Other companies known to be currently serving the genetic analysis market
include Affymetrix, Inc., GE Healthcare (a business segment of General Electric
Company), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Eppendorf AG, Beckman Coulter, Inc.,
Luminex Corporation, Cepheid, Pacific Biosciences of California, Inc.,
NanoString Technologies, Inc., Sequenom, Inc., RainDance Technologies, Inc.,
Qiagen N.V., Biometra Biomedizinische Analytik GmbH, Enzo Biochem, Inc., Idaho
Technologies, Inc. and the Roche family of companies. The marketplace for gene
expression technologies is highly competitive, with many of the major players
already controlling significant market share, many of which have significantly
greater financial, technology, and other resources than we do. Illumina is the
leader in microarrays and LIFE is the market leader for real-time PCR. These two
companies also have a commanding market share in NGS. We believe gene expression
is a growing market and this market is driven by the need for real-time PCR
performance for discovery, and a higher throughput platform for validation, to
overcome the limitations of microarrays and real time PCR technologies that are
currently used for discovery and validation respectively. WaferGen’s SmartChip
Real Time PCR System is presently the only platform that offers a single 
solution for both biomarker discovery and validation with low running costs, 
simplified workflow and fast results. Our competitors could compete with us by 
developing new products similar to our SmartChip System. Even though we believe
that we have created a unique solution, this does not mean that our competitors
will not develop effective products to compete with our products.


Company Description
Since we commenced operations in 2003, we have been engaged in the development
of systems for gene expression quantification, genotyping and stem cell
research. Since 2008, our primary focus has been on the development, manufacture
and marketing of our SmartChip System, a genetic analysis platform


 used for
profiling and validating molecular biomarkers in the life sciences and
pharmaceutical drug discovery industries. Since the beginning of 2014, following
an acquisition, we now also sell the Apollo 324™ product line used in library
preparation for next-generation sequencing (“NGS”). Our combined product lines
now offer one-stop shopping for NGS sample preparation and validation solutions
that enable NGS instruments (such as MiSeqTM from Illumina and PGMTM from Thermo
Fisher) to produce better results in terms of accuracy, while at the same time
simplifying the workflow in a cost efficient manner.

Our SmartChip products are aimed at researchers who perform genetic analysis,
primarily at pharmaceutical and biotech companies, academic and private research
centers and diagnostics companies involved in biomarker discovery and genetic
research. Many scientists believe that much of the work to seek new therapeutic
solutions will be directed at understanding the expression level of key relevant
segments of DNA (i.e. genes and other regulatory elements), as well as the
changes in their sequence (i.e. mutations such as single nucleotide
polymorphisms (“SNPs”)). Gene expression is fundamental to the understanding of
many disease processes and hence, drug efficacy. For example, in the field of
oncology (cancer treatment), greater understanding of gene expression in certain
types of cancerous cells has led to the discovery of specific disease biomarkers
that will allow clinicians to provide more accurate diagnosis, prognosis and
treatment options for their patients. Increasingly, researchers are focusing
their attention on studying physiological phenomena at the molecular level and
are consequently committing their research budgets to acquiring research tools
that help them develop personalized therapies.

We are primarily focused on marketing a flexible, open format genetic analysis
system, the WaferGen SmartChip System, which provides a range of high throughput
capabilities including mRNA, microRNA and lncRNA expression level measurement,
as well as SNP genotyping. In August 2010, we formally launched our first
generation SmartChip 5K System, which was an innovative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (“real-time PCR”) tool enabling scientists to study thousands of
genes simultaneously clustered in gene specific pathways. The results of such
studies are potentially leading to the discovery and validation of clinically
relevant disease signatures. We believe that the SmartChip System is well suited
for the large and growing genomics markets, including for researchers seeking to
confirm and expand on discoveries made with the growing use of NGS. In
July 2012, we launched the SmartChip MyDesign System, which is the
second-generation instrument with significantly upgraded capabilities. First,
the new system allows customers to dispense their own assays into a SmartChip,
which gives them much greater flexibility and faster experiment turnaround time.
Second, we have enabled SNP genotyping on the SmartChip by validating
appropriate chemistries and supplying the requisite software. The SmartChip
System’s high density, nanoliter-scale format can provide throughput levels that
facilitate the development of life science clinical research solutions at a
fraction of the time and cost currently possible with existing competing
systems.

Most recently, our R&D efforts have been concentrated on the commercialization
of the SmartChip Target Enrichment (“TE”) System. This new product is designed
to perform a critical sample preparation step prior to targeted NGS. The
targeted sequencing is aimed at deciphering the nucleic acid sequence of a
certain portion of the genome (the targets), for example a set of genes of
interest, as opposed to the whole genome. In order to limit the sequencing to
the targets of interest, scientists are using various techniques including PCR
to treat the nucleic acid samples prior to sequencing. WaferGen is using its
SmartChip consumable to conduct massively parallel individual PCR reactions for
TE. This approach offers certain advantages over existing chemistries and
platforms. Although these advantages could help us successfully compete in the
high potential emerging market for clinical sequencing, we face considerable
competition, including the competing sample preparation kits from NGS instrument
manufacturers such as Illumina, Inc. (“Illumina”) and Life Technologies
Corporation (“LIFE,” now a division of Thermo Fisher).

We employ a business model that primarily generates revenue from the sale of
instruments (i.e. the SmartChip System or Apollo 324TM instrument) and a
recurring revenue stream from the sale of consumables (i.e. the SmartChip Panels
or PrepXTM reagents), similar to the “razor and razor blade” business model.

	WaferGen Bio-systems Reports Results for Third Quarter 2016









	Year-to-Date Revenues Represent 44% Growth over First Nine Months of 2015









	FREMONT, California – November 8, 2016


	 –


	WaferGen Bio-systems, Inc.


	 (NASDAQ: WGBS),


	a life sciences company focused on developing and commercializing technology platforms for genomic solutions,


	 announced today its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016.









	Key Recent Highlights


















	•






	The special shareholder meeting to vote on the proposed merger with Takara Bio USA Holdings Inc. was adjourned and rescheduled to November 15, 2016. Proxies received to date have been strongly in favor of the merger proposal but approval of a majority of all outstanding shares is necessary for this proposal to be approved.





















	•






	Product sales through our new Japanese distribution partner, Takara, since they were engaged in June 2016, have exceeded sales through our prior distributor during 2015.





















	•






	Quarterly product revenue increased 27% over the same quarter last year.





















	•






	Placed four ICELL8™ Single-Cell Systems in the third quarter of 2016.





















	•






	Closed on September 30, 2016, with $5.1 million in cash, which WaferGen believes is sufficient to fund operations into 2017.












	“We are pleased with the continued growth of WaferGen revenues which is being spurred by new applications for our ICELL8, SmartChip and Apollo systems. We are on track to achieve consolidated 2016 revenues exceeding $9 million and provide stockholders more clarity of the benefit they will receive from the merger with Takara Bio USA Holdings, Inc.,” said Rollie Carlson, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of WaferGen. “We have placed twelve


	ICELL8 Single-Cell Systems since our initial launch in October of 2015, and are pleased with our sales outlook in the fourth quarter.




	We are maintaining our full-year 2016 revenue guidance of $10 million to $12 million.”









	Third Quarter Ended September 30, 2016









	Total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $2.4 million, compared to approximately $2.0 million for the prior year period, which included $125,000 of license and royalty revenue related to an agreement which was terminated in early 2016. The increase of $509,000 in product revenue was primarily attributable to increases for the three months ended September 30, 2016, in sales of WaferGen’s SmartChip Systems, with revenue up 62% from the comparable 2015 period, mainly due to ICELL8 sales. Sales of SmartChip consumables and of the Apollo business products also increased, with revenue up 14% and 9%, respectively, from the comparable 2015 period


	.





















	Gross profit and gross profit margin related to product sales in the third quarter of 2016 were approximately $1.3 million and 53%, respectively, compared to gross profit and gross profit margin related to product sales of approximately $1.0 million and 55%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2015.  The decline in gross margin is mainly due to an increase in the percentage of revenue derived from the sale of systems, which afford lower margins than consumables.









	Operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased by $243,000 to $4.8 million, compared to $4.6 million for the same period of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses increased $312,000 to approximately $1.7 million, compared to approximately $1.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses decreased $168,000 to approximately $2.2 million, compared to approximately $2.4 million for the same quarter in 2015. General and administrative expenses increased $99,000 to $880,000, compared to $781,000 in the third quarter of 2015.









	Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $3.7 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to a net loss of approximately $3.5 million, or $0.61 per share, in the same period of 2015.









	Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016









	Total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, comprising product, license and royalty revenue, was approximately $6.8 million, compared to approximately $4.8 million for the prior year period.


	This includes license and royalty revenue of $42,000 in the 2016 period, compared to $375,000 in the prior year period, under an agreement that terminated at the end of January 2016.




	Product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $6.8 million, compared to approximately $4.4 million for the prior year period. The increase of approximately $2.4 million in product revenue was primarily attributable to increases for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, in sales of WaferGen’s SmartChip Systems, with revenue up 175% from the comparable 2015 period, mainly due to ICELL8 sales. Sales of SmartChip consumables and of the Apollo business products also increased, with revenue up 16% and 27%, respectively, from the comparable 2015 period


	.











	Gross profit and gross profit margin related to product sales in the first nine months of 2016 were approximately $3.4 million and 50%, respectively, compared to gross profit and gross profit margin related to product sales of $2.5 million and 56%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2015.









	Operating expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, increased by approximately $1.4 million to $16.1 million, compared to $14.7 million for the same period of 2015. Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $1.5 million to approximately $5.3 million, compared to approximately $3.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses decreased $256,000 to approximately $6.9 million, compared to approximately $7.1 million for the same period in 2015. General and administrative expenses increased $238,000 to approximately $3.9 million, compared to approximately $3.6 million in the first nine months of 2015, the increase being due to substantial legal and professional costs incurred related to our pending merger with Takara.





















	Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $13.0 million, or $0.69 per share, compared to a net loss of approximately $12.1 million, or $2.13 per share, in the same period of 2015.









	At September 30, 2016, WaferGen had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $5.1 million.











	2016 Guidance




	WaferGen continues to expect its full-year 2016 revenue will be between $10.0 million and $12.0 million.

(WGBS), a life sciences company focused on developing and commercializing technology platforms for genomic solutions, announced today its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2016.Key Recent HighlightsThe special shareholder meeting to vote on the proposed merger with Takara Bio USA Holdings Inc. was adjourned and rescheduled to November 15, 2016.  Proxies received to date have been strongly in favor of the merger proposal but approval of a majority of all outstanding shares is necessary for this proposal to be approved.Product sales through our new Japanese distribution partner, Takara, since they were engaged in June 2016, have exceeded sales through our prior distributor during 2015.Quarterly product revenue increased 27% over the same quarter last year.Placed four ICELL8™ Single-Cell Systems in the third quarter of 2016.Closed on September 30, 2016, with $5.1 million in cash, which WaferGen believes is sufficient to fund operations into 2017."We are pleased with the continued growth of WaferGen revenues which is being spurred by new applications for our ICELL8, SmartChip and Apollo systems.  We are on track to achieve consolidated 2016 revenues exceeding $9 million and provide stockholders more clarity of the benefit they will receive from the merger with Takara Bio USA Holdings, Inc.," said Rollie Carlson, Ph.D., President and

FREMONT, Calif. and MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., May 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- WaferGen Bio-systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:   WGBS), a publicly held genomics technology company ("WaferGen"), and Takara Bio USA Holdings, Inc. ("TBUSH"), today announced that they have entered into a merger agreement pursuant to which TBUSH will acquire WaferGen.  TBUSH is a wholly owned subsidiary of Takara Bio Inc. (TSE: 4974), a leading global biotechnology and life science company ("Takara Bio"). Takara Bio USA, Inc. ("TBUSA," formerly known as Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) is a wholly owned subsidiary of TBUSH and is a guarantor under the merger agreement.








Under the terms of the merger agreement, TBUSH will acquire WaferGen for an aggregate cash purchase price that will be based on a multiple of WaferGen's 2016 calendar revenue and capped at $50.0 million, subject to the potential adjustments described below. The multiple will range between 1.0 times up to 3.5 times WaferGen's full year 2016 revenue.  If revenues exceed $9.0 million the multiple will be 3.5.  The aggregate purchase price as so determined will be used to pay for all outstanding securities of WaferGen, including options and warrants and other securities as well as outstanding shares.  The merger is expected to close after completion of WaferGen's audited financial statements in February or March of 2017, subject to the conditions set forth in the merger agreement.  
Highlights of the Merger

Adds ICELL8™ Single-Cell System, Smart Chip PCR™ and Apollo 324™ platforms to TBUSA's global reagent product mix 
Couples WaferGen's high throughput ICELL8™ Single-Cell System, introduced in Q4 2015, with TBUSA's single-cell reagents, which will provide best in class solutions for single-cell researchers worldwide 
Expands the access of WaferGen technology platforms to the global genomics market
"WaferGen's technologies and broad array of rapidly growing product offerings are providing a powerful set of tools for biological analysis at the molecular and single-cell level in the life sciences, pharmaceutical, and clinical laboratory industries," said Rollie Carlson, President and CEO of WaferGen.  "I'm confident that through this merger we will cement a leadership position in the genomics research market and our combined solutions will accelerate breakthrough scientific and medical discoveries worldwide."
"The combination of TBUSA's RNA-seq and T Cell Receptor (TCR) profiling technologies with WaferGen's ICELL8 platform for isolation and processing of single cells will significantly expand our offering in the fast-growing single-cell and immuno-sequencing markets, and give customers greater access to these products through our global and commercial reach," said Carol Lou, President of TBUSA. "WaferGen's technologies are highly complementary to our reagent portfolio and the combination presents new opportunities for us in genetic analysis including clinical and applied markets." 
The WaferGen acquisition will allow Takara Bio to augment and expand its worldwide commercial offerings in transcriptomics and create new market opportunities in other areas of genomics.  Takara Bio provides a wide range of life science products and services under the Takara®, Clontech®, and Cellartis® brands that assist discovery, translational and clinical scientists in the advancement of their work.  
Key Transaction Terms
Pursuant to the merger agreement, at the effective time of the merger, WaferGen's outstanding shares of Common Stock and Series 2 Convertible Preferred Stock will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Aggregate Consideration (determined pursuant to the merger agreement) divided by the aggregate amount of shares of WaferGen Common Stock, calculated on a fully diluted basis, taking into account the conversion or exercise of Preferred Stock, stock options and warrants that are "in the money," restricted stock units ("RSUs") and any other shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to derivative securities of WaferGen.
For purposes of determining the amount per share to be paid in connection with the merger, an assumed amount, determined solely for purposes of such calculation (the "Aggregate Consideration"), shall be determined pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the merger agreement, summarized as follows:

First, an amount (the "Revenue Multiple Amount") based upon WaferGen's consolidated revenues for the year ending December 31, 2016 (the "2016 Revenue") determined by multiplying the 2016 Revenue by (i) 1.0, if the 2016 Revenue is less than $3.0 million, (ii) 2.0, if the 2016 Revenue is equal to or greater than $3.0 million and less than $6.0 million, (iii) 2.5, if the 2016 Revenue is equal to or greater than $6.0 million and less than $9.0 million, or (iv) 3.5, if the 2016 Revenue is equal to or greater than $9.0 million. The Revenue Multiple Amount is capped at $50.0 million. 
Second, the Aggregate Consideration shall be reduced by any amounts paid to WaferGen under the Deposit Agreement (described below) that have not been returned to TBUSH in accordance with the Deposit Agreement and the merger agreement. 
Third, the Aggregate Consideration shall be reduced by an amount equal to (1) the increase, if any, in Indebtedness (as such term is defined in the merger agreement), plus (2) the increase, if any, in Certain Closing Related Costs (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) (including amounts payable pursuant to severance, retirement, termination or change of control provisions) plus (3) the increase, if any, in bonus payment obligations, in each case comparing the amount of such obligations at closing compared to the current amount of such obligations. 
Fourth, the Aggregate Consideration shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of certain Transaction Fees (as such term is defined in the merger agreement) paid by Takara Bio on behalf of WaferGen or otherwise not paid as of the effective time of the merger. 
Fifth, the Aggregate Consideration shall be reduced, to the extent applicable, by the aggregate amount of any unpaid costs incurred in connection with any issuance by the Company of debt or equity securities after the date of the merger agreement. 
To arrive at the amount per share to be paid in connection with the merger, an amount equal to (i) the aggregate exercise price of all "in the money" stock options plus (ii) the difference between the aggregate maximum exercise price of all "in the money" warrants and the aggregate amount potentially payable in respect of certain "BSV" warrants will be added to the Aggregate Consideration.  That sum will then be divided by the aggregate amount of shares of Common Stock, calculated on a fully diluted basis, taking into account the conversion or exercise of Preferred Stock, stock options and warrants that are "in the money," RSUs and any other shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to any other outstanding derivative securities of the Company.  The per share amount received by holders of Preferred Stock will be based on the number of shares of Common Stock into which a share of Preferred Stock is convertible.
Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement, WaferGen and TBUSH entered into a Deposit Agreement pursuant to which, following receipt of WaferGen stockholder approval of the merger agreement, TBUSH will pay to WaferGen (1) $2.5 million and (2) after January 1, 2017 and on or before January 17, 2017, an additional $2.5 million (collectively, the "Deposit Amount").  Each payment of the Deposit Amount is conditioned on WaferGen's remaining in compliance with the merger agreement and certain other conditions set forth in the Deposit Agreement.  In the event that the merger agreement is terminated, unless such termination is due to TBUSH's breach, WaferGen must return to TBUSH the amount of the Deposit Amount. WaferGen also has the right to return all or any portion of the Deposit Amount prior to the date ten business days prior to the closing of the merger.
The transaction is subject to closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement including, among other things, approval by WaferGen's stockholders, continuous maintenance by WaferGen of its Nasdaq listing and completion of WaferGen's 2016 audit.
