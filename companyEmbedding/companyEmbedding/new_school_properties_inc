Liberal Arts
Across The New School, our liberal arts programs offer bold ways to better the world through critical inquiry, engagement, and expression.  Here, all students can study liberal arts with both scholarly rigor and intellectual freedom, whether through dedicated focus at

                Media Studies and throughout our university, resonate with innovative entrepreneurial thinkers with a commitment to advancing progressive change.

The New School: A Progressive University in NYCOur University
Imagine a place where scholars, artists, and designers find the support they need to challenge convention and fearlessly create positive change in the world. 
Imagine an intellectual and creative haven that never has — and never will —
 settle for the status quo.
The New School is a progressive urban university where the walls between disciplines are dissolved, so that 
journalists can collaborate with designers, architects with social 
researchers, media specialists with activists, poets with musicians.  Our HistoryIn 1919, a few great minds imagined a school that would rethink the purpose of higher learning. The New School is an amalgamation of a world-famous design school, a premier liberal arts college, a renowned performing arts school, a legendary social research school, and other advanced degree programs, created to challenge and support freethinkers who want to change the world. No matter what your age or stage of life, you can find more to learn at The New School. With over 135 undergraduate and graduate degree programs, our university offers a more creatively inspired, rigorously relevant education than any other. Our university's urban academic centers in New York City, Paris, and Mumbai offer almost 10,000 students the chance to expand their knowledge and view of the world. We invite you to learn more about our one-of-a-kind university. Our SchoolsNo matter what area of study students pursue at The New School, they will discover a unique form of creative problem solving that will forever change the way they investigate and create. They will learn to relentlessly question convention, collaborate across disciplines, and take risks. They will immerse themselves in a world of critical analysis and intense scholarship. And ultimately, they will seek new ways to effect positive change. Here is how our five progressive colleges inspire world-changing creativity. Where will you find your place in the future?

Silicon Valley billionaires are sick of normal schools — so they've created this one

A new kind of school crafted by the minds and wallets of Silicon Valley influencers is going through a growth spurt.
AltSchool, an educational software developer and network of "micro-schools" with locations in California and New York, has raised $40 million in a new round of funding, according to an SEC filing.
The startup previously raised over $130 million from Silicon Valley giants including Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, and Andreessen Horowitz. 
In May 2015, Business Insider spent the day at AltSchool's Fort Mason location in San Francisco to see its revolutionary teaching style in action.

AltSchool is a network of "micro-schools," each enrolling between 35 and 120 students, that aims to bring education into the 21st century.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





Max Ventilla, former head of personalization at Google, left the company to found AltSchool in 2013. Today there are seven locations across the Bay Area and New York.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





The venture-backed school system is eyeing an expansion in Chicago in fall 2018. It also wants to bring its technology to new schools that operate outside its network.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





In 2015, we spent the day at AltSchool's Fort Mason location in a ritzy San Francisco neighborhood. At the time of our visit, tuition cost more than $20,000 a year.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





AltSchool divides students between the ages of 4 and 14 into three groups: lower elementary, upper elementary, and middle school. There are no traditional grade levels.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





A typical day at AltSchool begins with attendance. As kids arrive, they sign in to the school's attendance app on a dedicated iPad.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





The attendance app is one of many tools developed by an in-house product team, which includes former employees of Apple, Uber, Zynga, and Ventilla's alma mater, Google.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





Those products live on My.AltSchool, a digital platform that tracks everything from students' attendance and grades to food allergies and Personalized Learning Plans, or PLPs.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





The PLP is the foundation of the AltSchool experience. Teachers work with families and students to design a set of goals for the learner based on the student's interests, likes, strengths, and weaknesses.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





Each child receives a weekly "playlist" of individual and group activities that are aimed at achieving those goals. This student was writing an entry for his blog on coin collecting.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





This 8-year-old demonstrated a game of Pac-Man using MaKey MaKey — a simple circuit board that transforms everyday objects into touchable user interfaces.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





He attached alligator clips to mounds of clay and taped one clip to himself. When he tapped the clay and completed the circuit, the computer interpreted the input as arrow key actions.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





Teachers pick activities for their students by creating items in their playlists or searching the My.AltSchool library to find items that other teachers have made.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





This streamlined instruction time frees up the teacher to walk around the classroom and interact face-to-face with students.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





The lower elementary students spent the morning of my visit knocking a shared item off their playlists: "writing the news." These guys chronicled a recent trip to the park.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





Many of the younger kids wear headphones during playlist time to drown out distractions.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





Technology isn't necessary to complete all activities, but it is used to document students' work. This student used an iPad to take a picture of her news clipping and uploaded the image to her playlist.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





The classroom, like the tech, fosters AltSchool's individualized learning approach. Students sprawl across the room on carpets, beanbags, and even lofts of their own construction.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





Classrooms are treated like stations, rather than designated areas for different grade levels. Students move from room to room throughout the day. It's especially important for micro-schools to maximize space so that a four-room schoolhouse doesn't feel cramped.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





Craft and cleaning supplies are stored where the smaller kids can reach them, giving them a sense of agency.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





Cameras are also mounted at eye level for kids, so teachers can review successful lessons and "the steps leading up to those 'ah-ha' moments," head of school Kathleen Gibbons said. Some children use them as confessionals, sharing their secrets with the camera.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





After lunch and PE in the nearby park, students put aside their playlists and work on more integrated group projects.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





The middle-school students were tasked with a classroom redesign. This 11-year-old designed a parkour course. He was writing a parent permission slip on his Google Chromebook.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





His classmate learned from online tutorials how to use a 3D-modeling software, and she designed an urban-garden-inspired seating area for the second-floor deck. There was an obstacle course inside the benches for a class rabbit to tunnel through.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





Another student, who wants to be a veterinarian, lawyer, writer, and manga comic-book writer, grew an indoor tea garden. She said she loves how the assignments "bend to your ability."
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





The new $40 million in funding that AltSchool raised will enable the network to grow beyond a handful of schoolhouses in the Bay Area and New York.
Melia Robinson/Business Insider





If Silicon Valley's favorite elementary school has its way, personalization will remain king.
