Tamiami Angel Fund II invests in ZoneFlow Reactor Technologies
The Tamiami Angel Fund II (T2) has invested $750,000 in ZoneFlow Reactor Technologies, LLC, a company developing new reactor technologies used in the production processes for refining crude oil, producing ammonia and methanol, and reducing iron ore to iron.
The fund recently closed on the investment into its sixth portfolio company, allocating $250,000 in capital interest to ZoneFlow Tech and an additional $500,000 add-on commitment.
ZoneFlow Tech, founded in 2007, is currently testing its proprietary reactor technology designed to improve efficiency in the production of hydrogen and syngas by the steam methane reforming process. 
“We are very pleased to have a Fund like T2 decide to make a major investment in our company, and we treat that as a real compliment to our business plan and what we’ve accomplished to date,” said Bruce Boisture, CEO of ZoneFlow.
“T2’s investment will fund continued product development and testing,” said Gerald Lippes, a member of T2’s due diligence team.
Lippes said the team was impressed by ZoneFlow’s professional management, its knowledge of the industry and its use of financing.
“The company is in the manufacturing business, which gives us an interesting diversity for our fund,” said Timothy Cartwright, chairman of T2. “Most of our fund is invested in high-tech.”
ZoneFlow’s progress was another factor, with the company expecting to introduce its technology in the next few years.
“From the outset, we’ve been involved very heavily with engineering, production and catalyst companies in our industry as we’ve developed our product,” said Boisture. “We have also focused entirely on validation programs that range from joint development of specific product applications to pilot plant testing. The funding from T2, in addition to the capital raise, will allow us to pursue and execute the validation programs, the first of which commenced this month. We also executed the first round of preliminary tests on a separate major testing program that began a year ago.”
 “The company is pretty far along with what it wants to achieve,” Lippes said. “ZoneFlow is starting to test the technology and that’s why we invested. It’s a different product than what’s currently available in the marketplace so its success also depends on the response from the industry.”
The potential game-changing technology has far-reaching applications in a large market, including crude oil refining, making ammonia for fertilizer, producing methanol, and reducing iron ore to iron.
Tamiami Angel Fund I & II LLC are member-managed funds designed to enable private accredited investors to actively participate in a disciplined investment process. The funds invest in promising early-stage through expansion-stage commercial ventures located in the U.S., with a preference to those in the state of Florida. The Funds are members of the Angel Capital Association and the Florida Venture Forum. For more information, visit http://www.tamiamiangels.com.

ZoneFlowTM Reactors – Poised to Revolutionize the Production of Hydrogen for Essential Industrial Processes

Zone Flow reactors will operate at the heart of the steam methane reforming process, providing hydrogen for use in refining crude oil, making ammonia for fertilizer and other applications, producing methanol, and reducing iron ore to iron.  Radically more efficient in every respect than the incumbent technology, ZoneFlow reactors will be a complete game-changer in this massive market.

Our Core Technology | ZoneFlow™ Reactor Technologies, LLC















































Our Core Technology

ZoneFlow™ Reactors are a new class of catalytic reactor designed to replace pellet-type catalysts used in steam reforming. Being an engineered packing instead of a random packing, the ZoneFlow Reactor has superior heat transfer, reactivity, pressure drop and durability designed into it. We can adjust the mixture of these benefits according to customer needs.
Our reactor consists of a metal foil substrate coated with the active catalyst. The dimensions of the reactor are easily adjusted to the reformer tube diameter, and the elastic metal substrate presses against the inner wall of the tube and follows the subsequent creep in tube diameter over time.
Because the substrate is resilient, its wall thickness can be much less than is required to protect the pellets from crushing. That means the solid volume of our reactor, which impedes flow, is reduced from about 50% with pellets to about 20% in ZoneFlow Reactors.  It also means the void volume is structured purposefully to support reactor performance.  The pulverization failure mechanism of the brittle pellets upon thermal cycling is also eliminated.
Pressure drop in the ZoneFlow Reactors is strictly reserved for the performance of heat transfer functions by ruthlessly designing out any redirection of flow within the reactor that does not help distribute the flow of heat from the tube to the reaction sites. The engineering of the packing enables all transverse flow to be designed to be predominantly either centrifugal to break down the boundary layer at the tube wall or centripetal for the heated gas to return to the internal reaction sites.
The geometric surface area of the ZoneFlow Reactor is more than double that of reforming pellets. In addition, the reaction sites are placed near the tube wall heat source, so less energy is expended bringing the heat to the reaction sites. The combination of more surface area, much thinner layers of catalyst, and advantageous placement of the reaction sites in the ZoneFlow Reactor boosts the effectiveness of the catalyst by at least 20x.
Precision engineering of these features enables ZoneFlow Reactors to provide 70% lower pressure drop while substantially improving heat transfer.  Alternatively, we can configure the reactors to more than double heat transfer while reducing pressure drop by more than 30% compared to commercial reforming pellets.
