Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.

Marten Transport Announces Five-For-Three Stock Split






GlobeNewswire



Jun 15, 2017 4:01 PM EDT













 


















































 MONDOVI, Wis., June 15, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marten Transport, Ltd. (Nasdaq/GS:MRTN) announced today that its Board of Directors has declared a five-for-three stock split of the company's common stock.  The stock split will be effected in the form of a stock dividend payable on July 7, 2017, to stockholders of record as of June 26, 2017.  Holders of the company's common stock will receive an additional two-thirds share for each outstanding share of common stock held as of the record date.  The stock split will increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock from approximately 32,708,453 to approximately 54,514,088. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Randolph L. Marten said, "I am pleased to announce this stock split which reflects our continued strong financial condition.  The increased number of outstanding shares should increase trading activity, or float, in our common stock.  This stock split, while maintaining our current quarterly cash dividend of $0.025 per share, effectively increases the cash payout to our stockholders by 66 2/3%." Marten Transport, with headquarters in Mondovi, Wis., is one of the leading temperature-sensitive truckload carriers in the United States, specializing in transporting and distributing food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment.  Marten's dry freight services are expanding, with 925 dry trailers operating as of March 31, 2017.  Marten offers service in the United States, Canada and Mexico, concentrating on expedited movements for high-volume customers. Marten's common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol MRTN.

ROADSUPPORT



                Marten Transport maintains a commitment to every customer and
                every load, and that starts with supporting our drivers.
                That's why we’re there with every driver before, during,
                and after their run.
                
For on-the-road support, contact the
                    Mondovi Terminal: (800) 695-1038








SAFETY



                At Marten Transport, Ltd. we view safety as a priority - and
                our track record proves it. We've been named Grand Prize Winner
                for Fleet Safety by the Truckload Carriers Association twice
                and placed among the top three in the contest seven times.
                The Georgia Motor Trucking Association awarded us their
                Grand Champion Safety Award honors for General Commodities
                Truckload Division in 2002 and 2004. We also earned top
                safety distinction from the Wisconsin Motor Carriers Association
                in 2004. Our Safety Department is responsible for compliance
                to all Federal safety regulations, on behalf of our entire
                company and all of it's employees. Our concern is not only
                for the employees of Marten, but also the motoring public
                that we all come in contact with on a daily basis.
            

Responsibilities Include:


                &bullet; DOT Inspections
                &bullet; Citations
                &bullet; Drug and alcohol testing
                &bullet; Accident prevention
                &bullet; Quarterly Safety Bonus Program
                &bullet; Hazardous Materials
                &bullet; Canada Border Crossing
                &bullet; Company Security
            







HUMANRESOURCES



                At Marten, the goal is to provide the best experience
                for drivers. When a driver is hired the expectation
                is that this will be the last company they drive for.
                Marten supports its lofty expectations with competitive
                wages, outstanding benefits and realistic bonus opportunities.
                It offers drivers over-the-road, regional and dedicated
                fleet opportunities, and has eliminated responsibilities
                (like handling freight and pallets) to help reduce
                delays and extra stress. It's these kinds of 
                proactive measures that has helped Marten earn the
                praise and appreciation of those who pilot its fleet.
