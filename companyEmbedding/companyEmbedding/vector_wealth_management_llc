 Our goal is to give our clients an UNDERSTANDING and CONFIDENCE around their financial lives that they may not have experienced before. 






About VectorMeet The TeamOur ApproachThe RIA DifferenceSojournWho We ServeDisclaimer 






					Our Approach			





At Vector Wealth Management, we believe the complexities of managing wealth require a team approach to give our clients an understanding and confidence around their financial lives that they have not experienced before.
Our clients receive services from their personal Advisor, a member of the Portfolio Management Group and a member of Advanced Planning/Client Services, allowing for deeper, more diverse level of support.
Advisors
The role of an advisor at Vector Wealth Management is to be the team leader between the Advisor, the Portfolio Management Group, and Advanced Planning/Client Services. The measurement of how well we do for our clients will always be based on the Advisors' ability to reflect the goals, desires and values of each of our clients and communicate this internally to make certain that the plan executed matches our clients' objectives.
Our Advisors have a planning discipline, with a strong interest on the investment management side. The diversity of contributions between CFP® Professionals (Advanced Planning) and CFAs (Portfolio Management Group) creates optimal results in wealth management.
The role of a fiduciary, to which Vector and its Advisors adhere, means to act solely in the interest of our clients through customized investment management, strategic financial planning, and personal consultation.
Portfolio Management Group
The staging of assets is customized based on each client’s own circumstances surrounding income requirements, tax situation and inheritance/gifting objectives. Each portfolio is adjusted to achieve the growth or stability required over the assigned time-frame. We use these time-frame expectations to assign specific tasks and time horizons to your assets, tying them to their intended usage.
Additional areas of portfolio design and management include:

Asset Allocation Strategies
Portfolio Expense Audit
Investment Overlap Analysis
Corporate Retirement Plans

Our investment committee conducts ongoing investment monitoring through economic analysis and securities research to determine allocations and investment options for our clients. Your specific policy is determined based on your unique financial situation and our written performance reports allow you to remain informed.
Additional areas of monitoring and reporting include:

Concentrated Position Risk Management
Held-Away Asset Review/Integration
Strategic Tax Loss/Gain Selling
Legacy Asset Strategies

Advanced Planning/Client Services
Client Services
Our relationship with our clients extends to a variety of services which include gathering personal financial information, opening new accounts, initiating transfers, setting up cash flows between accounts, and obtaining other important financial documents for our comprehensive review. Once established, our services continue with ongoing account maintenance including cash flow management and a variety of other service related items.
 Advanced Planning
As part of our Advanced Planning process, we begin every relationship by developing a customized Sojourn® plan. Sojourn® is our proprietary application which allows us to build a personalized financial foundation for decision-making reflecting our clients' goals and individual circumstances. Having a plan provides our clients the understanding and confidence around their financial lives that they may not have experienced before.
Additional areas of planning include:


Retirement Contribution and Income Distribution Strategies
Whether in the wealth accumulation or distribution phase, we evaluate retirement accounts, social security benefits, pension income, mortgage and other liabilities to help you make decisions that meet your cash flow objectives.


Tax Strategies
We review our clients’ tax returns to understand clients’ tax liabilities and utilize strategies that may include Roth conversions, capital gain/loss execution, and deduction-optimization. We often work closely with our clients’ accountants to discuss their specific tax situation.


Estate Planning and Charitable Giving
We take great pride in our ability to create strategies and solutions based on your unique circumstances considering charitable objectives, multi-generational wealth, age differentials between spouses, blended families, special needs, or the desire to leave a legacy. We review existing wills and trusts which may result in collaborating with our clients’ attorneys.


Education Analysis and Funding
We work with our clients to identify an action plan by running cost projections for education and using products and strategies including 529s, trusts, after-tax accounts and funding from cash flow to recommend the most effective approach to achieving your desired goals.


Risk and Insurance Analysis
We evaluate your life, disability and long-term care insurance needs to verify the protection aligns with your overall needs and objectives.

Sojourn® is Vector's proprietary software application with a primary purpose of fulfilling our unique value as a financial wealth management firm. That unique value is to give our clients an understanding and confidence around their financial lives that they may not have experienced before.
This process creates a custom investment policy that is based on what you’re asking your  assets  to do. Technically, we call it liability-driven investing. Liability-driven investing allows your assets to support your income need through time-frame appropriate allocations for high probability returns.


Characteristics of our process:
 

Assets are segmented based on when they will be consumed (Page 2)
Portfolio adjustments are made over time (Page 3)
Your retirement income is staged to best take advantage of market cycles (Page 4)

 


 Assets are segmented based on when they will be consumed





Typically the first pie chart that clients are introduced to is some sort of asset allocation division, which in our opinion, couldn’t be more backwards.



At Vector we determine how much of each of our clients' assets have to be in specific time-frames to help support the income objectives they have in retirement. Our objective is to first come to an agreement around the stability of the plan and then make decisions around allocation relative to that stability.



We use a personal approach to design lower risk portfolios that are specific and unique to your cash flow needs, determining the asset amounts that need to be available to you over various time-frames.
We segregate assets into four portfolios based on time-frames to support the income objectives each individual has during retirement. Securing a stable retirement income stream builds a level of confidence within our clients, allowing them to enjoy what they worked so hard to create.
The level of stability of the plan influences our discussions regarding asset allocation. These discussions lead to an investment policy based on this highly refined division of assets to support each client’s lifestyle.
 


Portfolios adjustments are made over time

As you begin to consume from your assured income portfolio, all four portfolios are adjusted to achieve the growth or stability required over the assigned time-frame. This process of time-frame segmentation is utilized to assign specific tasks and time-frames to your assets, securing them for their intended usage.  This approach allows us to decide how to adjust portfolios independent of current market conditions.
Portfolio 1: Assured Income
This portfolio provides income for the first one to four years of retirement, making certain that these assets are subject to minimal market risk.
Portfolio 2: Preservation
This portfolio has a time frame of four to six years. Due to the relatively short time frame, this portfolio relies on a preservation strategy with a growth component to address anticipated inflation.
Portfolio 3: Accumulation
This is the first portfolio with more of a growth component due to the fact that we have approximately two to four market cycles or 10 years for these assets to grow.
Portfolio 4: Legacy
This is the long-term growth portfolio, with the greatest flexibility to orient toward growth depending most specifically on your risk tolerance and objectives.
 


Your retirement income is staged to best take advantage of market cycles

While we know that investment markets go through cycles, it is difficult to predict exactly when a cycle will start or end.
Segregating portfolios based on return expectations and time horizons achieves the growth or stability required over the assigned time-frame, liberating your income sources from the volatility of market cycles
The two most challenging decisions around investing are generally accepted to be: when to put money into the market, and when to take money out of the market for income when you need it.
Sojourn® creates a discipline around withdrawal strategies through a process of funding income needs one to four years in advance.
