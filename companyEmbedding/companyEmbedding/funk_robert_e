 Archaeological Investigations In The Upper Susquehanna Valley, New York State Volume 2 provides detailed accounts of the investigations of 25 archaeological sites. Also included in Volume 2 are "Palynological and Radiometric Analyses of Organic Samples from Archaeological and Non-Archaeological Localities."   It presents an essential source of data and interpretations on the human and natural histories of the upper Susquehanna River valley; a comprehensive treatment that is unlikely to be duplicated soon in New York or the greater Northeast.  The New York State Museum is pleased to offer Robert E. Funks classic work Archaeological Investigations In The Upper Susquehanna Valley, New York State Volume 1 and 2. The two volume set is critcal for archaeologists working in New York, and the broader Middle Atlantic and New England regions.
