Ongoing Research & Development
Novelion is developing a synthetic retinoid product candidate, zuretinol acetate, for the potential treatment of inherited retinal disease (IRD) caused by underlying mutations in RPE65 or LRAT genes, that prevent adequate functioning of the retinoid cycle. The disease area comprises leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP).
There are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency approved pharmacologic treatments for either LCA or RP, underscoring the significant unmet medical need. Zuretinol has Orphan Drug designation from both FDA and EMA, as well as FDA Fast Track designation. As an oral product, Zuretinol is being studied for its potential to treat the retinas of both eyes simultaneously.

Alexion stock rises 1.4% after naming new executives
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  shares rose 1.4% to $101.57 in morning trade Friday, after the company announced several new executives will start June 5. The news follows a massive managerial shake-up at the biopharmaceutical company in late May, in which Alexion announced the departures of its chief commercial officer, chief financial officer -- who started at the company in December -- and two executive vice presidents. The company has faced a scandal over sales practices for its expensive blood disorder medication Soliris. Alexion named John Orloff, who previously served as executive vice president at Novelion Therapeutics Inc. , as its head of  research and development, and named Anne-Marie Law, who previously served as chief human resources officer at Hyatt Hotels Corporation , as the new chief human resources officer. Alexion also named Indrani Lall Franchini, previously chief compliance officer at Hess Corporation , as its new chief compliance officer. Alexion shares have dropped 23.5% over the last three months, compared with with a 2% rise in the S&P 500 .

Alexion stock rises 1.4% after naming new executives
Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc.  shares rose 1.4% to $101.57 in morning trade Friday, after the company announced several new executives will start June 5. The news follows a massive managerial shake-up at the biopharmaceutical company in late May, in which Alexion announced the departures of its chief commercial officer, chief financial officer -- who started at the company in December -- and two executive vice presidents. The company has faced a scandal over sales practices for its expensive blood disorder medication Soliris. Alexion named John Orloff, who previously served as executive vice president at Novelion Therapeutics Inc. , as its head of  research and development, and named Anne-Marie Law, who previously served as chief human resources officer at Hyatt Hotels Corporation , as the new chief human resources officer. Alexion also named Indrani Lall Franchini, previously chief compliance officer at Hess Corporation , as its new chief compliance officer. Alexion shares have dropped 23.5% over the last three months, compared with with a 2% rise in the S&P 500 .

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.15      Net Money Flow ($)  4,847    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.
