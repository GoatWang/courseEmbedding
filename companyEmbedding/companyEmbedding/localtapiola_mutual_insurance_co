   	Affordable Coverage Renters Can Trust



When you rent an apartment, condo, or house, your landlord insures the building but not your property inside. You may think your possessions aren't very valuable, but replacing them all at once can be very expensive. Renters insurance eases your worries by:

Covering personal property so you’re protected from loss due to theft, fire, and certain forms of water damage.
Protecting you from liability claims resulting from accidental injuries to others.
Offering additional coverage for high-value items like electronics and jewelry. 

Renters Insurance from Liberty Mutual can cost as low as $12 a month - about the same as pizza delivery.1 Start a quote to get an affordable renters insurance policy today, or find information below about our coverage and discount options.








   	Personal Property


Standard Coverage


   	Covers your possessions from theft or damage, both inside and outside of the property you rent. Your possessions are covered in your car, when you're on vacation, and even when you’re moving.2









   	Liability


Standard Coverage


   	Protects you from loss up to your coverage limit if you accidentally damage someone else's property, or if injuries are suffered within your rental3 and a claim is filed against you.4









   	Home Computer and Smartphone


Additional Coverage


   	Provides additional protection, including higher limits and additional covered causes of loss for computers, peripheral devices, software, and media.









   	Blanket Jewelry


Additional Coverage


   	Provides additional protection for all jewelry items under a single limit that's specific to jewelry claims.












   	Many Ways to Save Money



   	Some of our renters insurance discounts are built right into your policy, while others are determined on an individual basis. You can save in the following ways:










   	Bundle and Save


   	Save when you bundle your renters insurance with your auto insurance policy.











   	Claims-Free Discount


   	Save when you haven't filed a claim with your previous insurance carrier for five years or more.

Challenge

			LocalTapiola Group needed to modernize its legacy, mainframe-based WinSure insurance management application.
		


Solution

			Since moving the product to the Progress OpenEdge platform, WinSure supports over 2,000 concurrent users, the total database size exceeds 2 terabytes, and the largest single database is over 500 gigabytes. LocalTapiola is also using OpenEdge Replication to ensure mission-critical systems are available 24/7/365.
		


Result

			With OpenEdge LocalTapiola Group can develop and deploy customized functionality more rapidly and cost effectively; it has accelerated its time to market with new insurance products; the organization has added value to its customers by reducing transaction administration workflows and associated costs, and by empowering business users to customize the solution without IT intervention.
		








Story




The LocalTapiola Group is Finland’s largest non-life insurer/carrier and manages nearly 2,000,000 policies for their 1,5 million customers served by 4,000 employees in a central office, 19 regional, independent mutual insurance companies and the mutual Insurance company Turva. LocalTapiola non-life written premium is approx. 1 billion Euro. The Progress OpenEdge-based WinSure insurance management application is one of IT systems that underpin its property and casualty (P&C) business. WinSure integrates policy and claims management along with billing and payment processing. As a unified solution that makes it possible for business users to define product parameters without the help of developers, WinSure is making LocalTapiola more agile in its P&C business.
Today, the mission-critical enterprise system supports over 2,000 concurrent users and this number is expected to go up. The total database size is in excess of 2 terabytes, while the largest single database is over 500 gigabytes. WinSure is also adaptable and versatile in the LocalTapiola environment, running on a mix of operating systems that includes HP Unix, AIX and Windows Server.
WinSure also uses OpenEdge’s replication capability, which plays a key role in the disaster recovery process. Replication provides recovery of essential data for applications at an alternate site, ensuring mission-critical systems are available 24/7/365. Database replication is also required to comply with government regulations covering data integrity and archiving. Finally, it allows business users to do as a  large-scale reporting on real-time data  without stressing the production environment. 
“By having OpenEdge Replication as part of our WinSure application we can business reporting without slowing down operational systems.” - Sami Luokkamäki, Head of Department, LocalTapiola ICT
A Source of Multiple Business Advantages

The latest implementation of WinSure has given LocalTapiola’s P&C business several distinctive advantages: 

At an IT operations level, WinSure’s distributed architecture and underlying Progress OpenEdge platform makes it possible to develop and deploy customized functionality more rapidly and cost effectively than was possible with the mainframes and older editions of the WinSure product. Standardization on the newest version of WinSure has streamlined maintenance and simplified usability.  System availability and performance have improved as well. 
Strategically, new insurance products – along with their systemic counterparts - can get developed, tested and introduced more quickly and economically than ever before.  
At the insurance business level, WinSure’s combination of policy underwriting, billing and payment, and claims management systems is resulting in improved financial results. When claims managers can narrow the loop of informing policy underwriters about risk and loss potential, the overall insurance business improves. Having a single system for policy management, billing and payments reduces transaction administration workflows and helps cut costs.
From a people and process perspective, the WinSure solution is helping create an agile, innovative business environment. WinSure is designed to enable business users to essentially own and manage the system themselves. One of WinSure’s big appeals is its ability to let business users set process parameters (parameterization) and deploy new functions without the help of IT application developers. “The WinSure application frees developers for other strategic tasks while it reduces IT maintenance and overhead, said [Executive].  “It’s all about ‘human capital management, one of our major priorities.”
As a “Green” technology, WinSure adds value by reducing paper use.  WinSure generates Web-based policy letters and other correspondence that previously had to be printed and mailed.

   	Affordable Coverage Renters Can Trust



When you rent an apartment, condo, or house, your landlord insures the building but not your property inside. You may think your possessions aren't very valuable, but replacing them all at once can be very expensive. Renters insurance eases your worries by:

Covering personal property so you’re protected from loss due to theft, fire, and certain forms of water damage.
Protecting you from liability claims resulting from accidental injuries to others.
Offering additional coverage for high-value items like electronics and jewelry. 

Renters Insurance from Liberty Mutual can cost as low as $12 a month - about the same as pizza delivery.1 Start a quote to get an affordable renters insurance policy today, or find information below about our coverage and discount options.








   	Personal Property


Standard Coverage


   	Covers your possessions from theft or damage, both inside and outside of the property you rent. Your possessions are covered in your car, when you're on vacation, and even when you’re moving.2









   	Liability


Standard Coverage


   	Protects you from loss up to your coverage limit if you accidentally damage someone else's property, or if injuries are suffered within your rental3 and a claim is filed against you.4









   	Home Computer and Smartphone


Additional Coverage


   	Provides additional protection, including higher limits and additional covered causes of loss for computers, peripheral devices, software, and media.









   	Blanket Jewelry


Additional Coverage


   	Provides additional protection for all jewelry items under a single limit that's specific to jewelry claims.












   	Many Ways to Save Money



   	Some of our renters insurance discounts are built right into your policy, while others are determined on an individual basis. You can save in the following ways:










   	Bundle and Save


   	Save when you bundle your renters insurance with your auto insurance policy.











   	Claims-Free Discount


   	Save when you haven't filed a claim with your previous insurance carrier for five years or more.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
