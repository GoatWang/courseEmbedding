Product Description▼▲
This superb commentary offers the first sustained attempt to read the Gospel of Mark both as an ancient biography and as a form of ancient rhetoric. Leading New Testament scholar Ben Witherington applies to Mark the socio-rhetorical approach for which he is well known, opening a fresh new perspective on the earliest Gospel. Witherington's work provides us with a fascinating view of how the life and teachings of Jesus were presented to a largely non-Jewish auidence - and what this presentation of Jesus still holds for Christians today.

Publisher's Description▼▲
This book offers the first sustained attempt to read the Gospel of Mark both as an ancient biography and as a form of ancient rhetoric. Ben Witherington applies to Mark the socio-rhetorical approach for which he is well known, opening a fresh new perspective on the earliest Gospel. Written when the fledging Christian faith was experiencing a major crisis during the Jewish war, Mark provides us with the first window on how the life and teachings of Jesus were presented to a largely non-Jewish audience. According to Witherington, the structure of Mark demonstrates that this Gospel is biographically focused on the identity of Jesus and the importance of knowing who he is--the Christ, the Son of God. This finding reveals that Christology stood at the heart of the earliest Christians' faith. It also shows how important it was to these earliest Christians to persuade others about the nature of Jesus, both as a historical figure and as the Savior of the world.


Author Bio▼▲
Ben Witherington III is Amos Professor of New Testament for Doctoral Studies at Asbury Theological Seminary, Wilmore, Kentucky. Related "kingdom" books of his include Imminent Domain: The Story of the Kingdom of God and Its Celebration,


Editorial Reviews▼▲
Religious Studies Review "Witherington intersperses homiletic asides within the flow of a clear, scientific treatise. . . His work deserves wide circulation."Mark Allan Powell "An impressive, reliable, and often surprising commentary on the Gospel of Mark."

Buddy Boone






  
            Witherington has written several of the socio-rhetorical commentaries for Eerdmans. This one on Mark's gospel is just tremendous. Dr. Witherington sets the paradigm for interpreting Mark by identifying it as an ancient biography in which the writer utilizes ancient rhetoric. Witherington sees Mark writing to a largely non-Jewish audience and this obviously impacts the interpretation of a number of passages. Since Dr. Witherington sees the book as biographical, he places great emphasis on the Christology of Mark's gospel. This commentary is lucid, yet profound. I highly recommend it to pastors, teachers and laypeople alike.

Overview
The Ancient Christian Commentary on Mark (now in its second edition) opens up a long-forgotten passage through the arid and precipitous slopes of post-Enlightenment critical interpretation and bears us along to a fertile valley basking in the sunshine of theological and spiritual interpretation. In these pages we enter the interpretive world that long nurtured the great premodern pastors, theologians and saints of the church.
In the Logos edition, this volume is enhanced by amazing functionality. Important terms link to dictionaries, encyclopedias, and a wealth of other resources in your digital library. Perform powerful searches to find exactly what you’re looking for. Take the discussion with you using tablet and mobile apps. With Logos Bible Software, the most efficient and comprehensive research tools are in one place, so you get the most out of your study.

            In "God Is," Mark Jones surveys the various communicable and incommunicable attributes of God through a devotional perspective. Jones emphasizes that when studying God's attributes, we must consider all these characteristics collectively as revealed through the Bible. Moreover, it is incorrect to consider one attribute as being more important than another as all of God's attributes are equally essential and necessary. Another point that the author asserts is that Jesus, as God incarnate possessing both divine and human natures, displays God's character in a tangible way to us. Thus, we can draw numerous implications on how we should live by imitating Christ who is the only human which reflected God's image perfectly. In each chapter, Jones discusses on one attribute using a threefold approach that examines how the doctrine of the attribute is found in Scripture, how the attribute is found in Christ as the God-man, and how the attribute applies to the Christian life. The author is careful to explain each attribute in the simplest terms backed by evidence from the Bible and observations from historical sources such as Augustine and the Westminster Confession of Faith. Furthermore, Jones skillfully draws out many helpful applications that most readers may not have realized when considering God's attributes in the past.


I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an accessible resource in learning about who God is and how He interacts with His creatures especially through His Son. Jones laments that there has been a steady decline in the attention given to God's attributes in both public and private worship. I would further add that Christians need to go beyond just believing that God exists. We need to increase our understanding and appreciation of God's attributes so that we can live faithfully and grow spiritually. When we consider God's majesty, glory, and sovereignty, the temporary discomforts and suffering we face becomes much more bearable. When we face temptations and difficulties, we can find comfort that our immutable, omniscient, and omnipotent God will give us strength to carry on. When we fall into sin, we can rest assured that our merciful, loving, and patient God will not give up on His children. When we advance in our knowledge of who God is, we will indelibly grow in our faith, obedience, and love for the triune God.


In compliance with Federal Trade Commission regulations, I was provided a review copy of this book from Crossway.

About this Series
The Ancient Christian Commentary on Scripture does what very few of today's students of the Bible could do for themselves. With the aid of computer technology, the vast array of writings from the church fathers—including much that is available only in the ancient languages—have been combed for their comment on Scripture. From these results, scholars with a deep knowledge of the fathers and a heart for the church have hand selected material for each volume, shaping, annotating and introducing it to today's readers. Each portion of commentary has been chosen for its salient insight, its rhetorical power and its faithful representation of the consensual exegesis of the early church.



About this Volume
The Ancient Christian Commentary: Mark covers the Gospel of Mark and can also be purchased as part of a money-saving bundle.
The early church valued the Gospel of Mark for its preservation of the apostolic voice and gospel narrative of Peter. Yet the early church fathers very rarely produced sustained commentary on Mark. This brisk-paced and robust little Gospel, so much enjoyed by modern readers, was overshadowed in the minds of the fathers by the magisterial Gospels of Matthew and John.
But now with the assistance of computer searches, an abundance of comment has been discovered to be embedded and interleaved amidst the textual archives of patristic homilies, apologies, letters, commentaries, theological treatises and hymnic verses.
In this Ancient Christian Commentary on Mark, the insights of Augustine of Hippo and Clement of Alexandria, Ephrem the Syrian and Cyril of Jerusalem join in a polyphony of interpretive voices of the Eastern and Western church from the second century to the seventh. St. Mark's Gospel displays the evocative power of its story, parables and passion as it ignites a brilliant exhibit of theological insight and pastoral wisdom.
The Ancient Christian Commentary on Mark (now in its second edition) opens up a long-forgotten passage through the arid and precipitous slopes of post-Enlightenment critical interpretation and bears us along to a fertile valley basking in the sunshine of theological and spiritual interpretation. In these pages we enter the interpretive world that long nurtured the great premodern pastors, theologians and saints of the church.

Description


In the first session of The Gospel of Mark: The Jesus We're Aching For, we're introduced to Mark and his fast-paced style of storytelling. Based on the preaching of Peter, Mark's Gospel uniquely reports Jesus' compassionate ministry. 
In session 2 of The Gospel of Mark: The Jesus We're Aching For, Lisa Harper talks about the price of being a Christ-follower. However, in spite of the cost, when we put our faith in Jesus Christ we're adopted in the forever family of God.
Session 3 is all about the amazing accessibility of Jesus. Though He is Lord of the universe, He is also an incredibly personal savior. Mark 4 & 5 show us His authority over the natural and supernatural, sickness, and even death, but through the story of the bleeding woman, we learn that He is a Savior who knows us and loves us on an individual, personal level.
In Session 4 we dive into Mark 9 and study Mark's passage on The Mount of Transfiguration. In this teaching we discover that what God promised in the Old Testament is perfectly fulfilled by Jesus in the New Testament.
In the last eight chapters of the Book of Mark, we turn from studying the compassionate works of Christ and begin the road to the cross. In Mark 10, Jesus continues to heal and perform miracles for the people He encounters, including Bartimaeus. Jesus not only heals him but changes his life.
In this sixth session of The Gospel of Mark: The Jesus We're Aching For we look at Mark 13. Jesus reminds us that even though being His followers in the end times is scary, He is still in control. He promised that there are hard days coming, but we have hope in Him.
In the last chapter of Mark, we learn about Mary Magdelene, who reminds us that we all have seasons when we feel undeserving to be Jesus' disciples and representatives of His hope. The first witness to the gospel, Mary Magdelene was healed by Jesus and used her former brokenness to proclaim His glorious message. He is our restorer and He calls even the least of us to be vessels of His living hope.

Our History 
 




history of it works!


IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
It Works!® started in 2001 and is now debt-free and expanding all over the world. But no matter how big we grow, we'll always do things at It Works! our way: the It Works! way.







1995 FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
It Works! was born out of Mark & Cindy Pentecost’s passion to offer families like yours the opportunity to dream big, to begin living life in your own terms—because they too had those dreams once themselves.
Long before the founding of It Works! Global, Mark was a high school teacher and basketball coach in the small town of Allegan, Michigan. Cindy was a stay-at-home mom with their three children, a job of the utmost importance that the family took great pride in her doing.  They were rich in love and filled with dreams, but struggling to make ends meet financially.
So Mark & Cindy devised a plan: an extra $500 a month, to be earned through a home-based business opportunity in the telecommunications industry.
After months of evening hours dedicated to their new side business, the Pentecosts’ earnings grew far beyond the goal they had originally set. After a few years, Mark became a top-ten earner in the company, bought the family’s freedom, and began to dream of the next big challenge: helping other families do the same.  They weren’t sure how they would do it yet, but the seed had been planted for It Works! Global.









2001 THE ULTIMATE BODY APPLICATOR
"The biggest challenge in this industry—and really the worldwide market—is to offer an uncommon solution, a true original, that captivates people and offers them something they never thought possible before.  When we found the Ultimate Body Applicator, we knew we had something special to share with the world.” - Mark Pentecost, CEO It Works! Global
To this day, It Works!’ first product is still its most popular: The Ultimate Body Applicator.  The site-specific body contouring treatment has been in the hands of celebrities at Hollywood events and at the doorsteps of people like you all over the world—exclusively available through It Works! Global.
It all started when Mark Pentecost received a call from Pam Sowder (now It Works! Chief Networking Officer) raving about a product that was an alternative to the growing trend for more drastic measures like cosmetic surgeries or constricting shapewear.
When the Pentecosts traveled to try this seemingly unbelievable product, Mark recalls, “I watched my wife try it. She was ecstatic with the results, and I watched her call her girlfriend right away to tell her what had happened.  Her girlfriend said that she wanted to try it, and they hung up.  It wasn't 30 seconds later, her girlfriend called back and said, ‘My daughter was listening, and she wants one for her chin. Is there something for the chin?' That was when I knew that we had a perfect product for direct selling, a product that people would be excited to share with their friends and family."
Since then, the Ultimate Body Applicator has become a global phenomenon, and Pam Sowder now travels all over the world to meet with distributors, give hands-on training and support, and share the Ultimate Body Applicator.







2001 THE MIND BEHIND THE MAGIC
A product so special as the Ultimate Body Applicator could only come from a mind that is both brilliant and passionate about the use of safe, natural ingredients: Luis Mijares.  Luis, the formulator behind the It Works! body contouring and skin care products, has been a friend and business partner to Mark Pentecost since their first introduction in 2001.
Luis' passion for research and development in the skin care, nutritional, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries began when he was a child, learning natural remedies from his grandmother in Mexico.  His abundant credentials, including his experience as the CEO of a top pharmaceutical company, his international reknown as an herbalist and university educator of phytotherapy (the uses of plants for medicinal purposes), along with his keen personal interest in natural solutions made Luis the ideal candidate for the It Works! Product Development Specialist.









2005 THE IT WORKS! PREMIUM SUPPLEMENTS   	LINE
The It Works! premium supplements line began when Mark made a routine visit to his doctor’s office several years ago. On this visit, Mark’s doctor instructed him to start taking a daily multi-vitamin supplement. But when Mark asked his doctor which one he should take, he was taken aback by the physician’s response: “I don’t know, but I wouldn’t take a cheap one. You only live once!" 
"I didn't know what to do with that," recalls Mark. "You want to know that you're putting the very best things in your body, so I began the long and hard search for the best multi-vitamin on the market."
Mark took a trip to a local nutrition store looking for answers. Sales people swarmed after him. Vitamins filled the shelves, all claiming different benefits. Over an hour later, Mark left feeling more confused than when he had gone in, overwhelmed with options. Next, he began asking his friends which vitamins they were taking. Some made their choices because the vitamin had a nice package. Others simply looked for a mid-priced vitamin, unsure of what exactly they were putting in their bodies. And others picked up the most expensive item, hoping that it was, in fact, the very best for them. 
"The more I got into the education of a vitamin, I started learning more about what's all natural versus synthetic," says Mark. "A lot of times you'd find that a product might have 100-200 ingredients, but there wasn't enough of each ingredient for the product to actually do what the clinicals showed they could do. You want something foundational that you know has the key ingredients to help keep us healthy and be the best we can be."
Eventually, Mark's search brought him to meet Don VerHulst, MD, a doctor with an extensive background in researching the effects of nutrition and natural remedies on today's common health issues. Mark and Dr. Don worked together to kick off the It Works! premium dietary supplements line with It's Vital, an advanced formula multi-vitamin, mineral, and enzyme supplement with all the known nutrients the body needs on a daily basis.
In his pursuit to find the best vitamin to keep his own body healthy, Mark has made it possible for you to have access to the same superior formula for yourself and your family. This standard of providing the best quality supplements on the market has carried through all our product formulations and remains the driving force behind the It Works! dietary supplements line.
Today, the It Works supplements line is a comprehensive collection of nutritional solutions for real people like you to help you combat the elements and stay healthy, and Dr. Don travels around the world with Chief Networking Officer Pam Sowder to teach on the benefits of the It Works! supplements and spread his message of ten easy steps to better health.
We proudly stand behind our commitment to nutritional supplements that contain the highest quality ingredients, offering you real, life-changing results at affordable prices. Whether you’re looking to reduce stress, lose weight, get top-notch nutrition, regulate your digestive system, or turn back the hands of time from the inside out, there is a solution for you in the It Works! supplements line.








2009 GROWING THROUGH A TOUGH ECONOMY
The economic crisis that began in 2009 presented many families and businesses across the world with devastating cirumstances.  We at It Works! feel very fortunate to have been able to be a source of hope for families in need during such difficult years through our steadfast business opportunity.
Despite the grim economy, It Works! became debt-free in 2009, and sales began to reach unprecendented heights.   








2010 REACHING INTERNATIONAL MARKETS
In 2010, It Works! expanded into Australia and select areas of Europe, and the company continued to break new records throughout the year.
"We have been blessed with products and an opportunity that not only withstood the financial market of recent years, but sales have skyrocketed from 2009 onward," says Mark. "We want to pour hope and goodness into people's lives through our product solutions and the It Works! opportunity, and we continue to be honored to be able to touch the lives of more and more people every year."








2011 A NEW HEADQUARTERS & FAMILY DESTINATION
In 2011, It Works! Global made the move from Grand Rapids, Michigan where it all began to a beautiful new home in Bradenton, Florida.  The corporate headquarters is nestled in a thriving community, just 20 minutes away from multiple world-class beaches and only a short mile down the road from It Works!' new sister company: Stoneybrook Golf Club of Bradenton.
Always ready for a competitive game of golf, Mark had long held the dream of owning his own golf course.  But a larger part of that dream was to have a place to share laughter and good times with the It Works! family, both corporate and distributors alike.
"It's been so much fun to have distributors out for leadership meetings at the beach, to host games at Stoneybrook, and to have everyone out here for company-wide Green Carpet Days where we treat distributors from all over the world to a good time," says Mark. "We look forward to many years of fun and fellowship at our Florida facilities."
The last ten years have been full of great memories, but we're just getting started.  The next ten years will be about you and your family, the differences you will see in your own life and the changes you will impact in the lives of others. 
See It Works! through the eyes of some of our distributors who have been with us for years, check out the It Works! opportunity, or shop our amazing product line. We look forward to meeting you and hearing your story next!








2012 It Works! reaches $100 million sales goal
It Works! reaches $100 million sales goal, then doubles it.  The G.O.O.D. bonus and new mantra “Debt Free Is the New Sexy” are introduced to align the field with the corporate philosophy of debt freedom.  With a 690 percent growth rate over three years, the company plans new, larger corporate headquarters.








2013 It Works! reaches $450 million mark 
 A history of exponential growth continues as It Works! reaches the $450 million mark.  The leadership team continues to focus on creating jobs while being the beacon of hope for those seeking to improve their health, appearance and lifestyle.








2014 It Works! finishes construction on new headquarters
It Works! completes construction on its new waterfront corporate headquarters.  The “re-dreaming” of 2013’s Mission Possible becomes reality for many It Works! Global distributors as they begin to live a life of friendship, fun and, most important of all, FREEDOM!

Description
God is not an idea. Christian faith is not a set of propositions you either believe or reject. According to a proper Trinitarian understanding, God is essentially relationship, a relationship of sheer, active, ecstatic, self-giving love.
This 51% Christian moniker is a ridiculous label with a deadly serious point. You now have permission to doubt, to question, to get angry at God. But, in the end, it’s not about you. Faith is about relationship: a living, daily relationship, based on trust, and active in concrete, daily practices.

Excerpt from the Afterword
 





We were getting caught up in the campaign of Christianity and losing the relationship . . .
"We were getting caught up in the campaign of Christianity and losing the relationship. And that's what you've seen in this book. Mark understands the shame and manipulation and hand-cuffing morality of the faith we were handed—the "smells like" culture Christians are always trying to shill to each other. He knows those sort of tactics are only a temporary fix. But he also understands the grace."
Joel Hodgson | Creator, Mystery Science Theater 3000 



Reviews



Review on Bill Tammeus's Faith Matters Blog
 



Endorsements





"Mark Stenberg is a brilliant theologian. In 51% Christian he makes some of the most graceful and beautiful theology you could ever imagine extremely accessible without sacrificing depth and complexity. There is nothing bland or trite here. He fills me with hope. He is also hilarious. You have found a treasure here. Enjoy."
Debbie Blue | author of "Consider the Birds" 





"Buckle up your seat belts and hold on to your hats, as Mark Stenberg is going to take you on a wild ride across theological terrain few are willing to enter. Stenberg moves so deftly between pop culture and classical theology and in such a deceptively entertaining way that you’ll hardly notice that he is inviting you into a far more exciting and life changing relationship to God than you'd imagined possible. Think you know enough about the Christian faith to embrace or reject it? Think again. Or, better, read Stenberg's manifesto and see where it leads you."
David Lose | president of Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia  





 "What is the nature of the Christian faith? Lest we forget, it's about questions, curiosity, and wonder. Stenberg calls us back to God’s revelation and reminds us that God insists on and invites us into relationship. Reading this book, anticipate an adventure in the unpredictable and uncertain arenas of theology that is at the same time grounded in God's reckless love."
Karoline Lewis | professor of preaching, Luther Seminary 





"Mark Stenberg is the smartest and funniest theologian I know. In 51% Christian, he delights in tangling with the big questions. His passion is so infectious you don't notice he has turned you into a theologian."
Russell Rathbun | pastor of House of Mercy Church
