Next Group Holdings Agrees to Acquire Tel3 from Arik Maimon

MIAMI, June 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH) announced today that it has signed an agreement with Arik Maimon, who serves as NXGH's CEO and Chairman, under which, subject to the receipt of a fairness opinion from an independent expert on such transactions, NXGH will acquire the telecom marketing brand "Tel3" together with the assets and client database of Tel3 from Mr. Maimon.  NXGH's Board of Directors approved the transaction unanimously and expects to close the acquisition of Tel3 by June 20, 2016.
Tel3 is a marketing group that had revenues over $3 million in 2015 with 31.5% gross margin, 25,000 active customers, and a database of 300,000 current and former clients. 
Mr. Maimon, who recently acquired Tel3 from a third party, has agreed to sell Tel3 to NXGH on substantially similar terms to the terms of the transaction under which he personally acquired the Tel3 assets, subject to the fairness opinion, a unanimous vote in favor of the transaction by all disinterest members of NXGH's board, and other regulatory considerations. 
"I believe that NXGH's acquisition of Tel3 will provide great value and substantial benefits to NXGH and its shareholders, as this deal will bring us a significant new revenue stream, additional profits and a large new customer base', said Michael De Prado, President and COO of NXGH. "This is a major step forward that will enhance NXGH's position in the markets for its telecommunications and its financial products", added De Prado.
NXGH plans to offer enhanced financial and telecom services and products to those Tel3 customers that opt-In to receive special offers and rewards based on their daily use of NEXTCALA and M&M Telecom offerings. 
NEXTCALA financial products will provide attractive pricing and extra benefits to unbanked and underbanked consumers.  Rewards programs will also help to lower costs and improve lifestyle and family connections.
NXGH, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Meimoun & Mammon LLC (which does business as M & M Telecom) expects to increase the revenue streams that were historically achieved by Tel3.  M & M Telecom has had FCC 214 "Common Carrier" Authority since 2011, and is a contributor to the FCC Universal Service Fund. As a result of NXGH's acquisition of Tel3, M & M Telecom will be able to offer and provide extra services, benefits and rewards to customers. 
"NXGH's acquisition of Tel3 assets will represent a major step forward to help us develop M & M Telecom into a major telecom provider and bring NEXTCALA to the forefront in the everyday financial solutions markets," said Arik Maimon, NXGH's chairman and CEO. "We believe that bringing Tel3 under the umbrella of M & M Telecom will produce significant revenue growth and profitability for NXGH."

Next Group Holdings Rewards Shareholders with Special Dividend


By August Patterson, Senior Staff Writer, Online Media Group, Inc.
MIAMI, FL, June 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ - Investors often take positions in companies with pending litigation, hoping that a favorable judgment will load corporate coffers and provide a boon in market valuation. On Friday, May 27, Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH) put a unique spin on the pending lawsuit of plaintiffs Next Communications, Inc. (an affiliate of NXGH) and NxtGn, Inc. (a subsidiary of NXGH) versus defendant Viber Media, Inc.  
The litigation, being heard in New York Southern District Court, asserts that Viber misused confidential information that the plaintiffs communicated to Viber pursuant to a non-disclosure agreement. Publicly available documents show that on March 30, 2106, District Judge Richard J. Sullivan denied Viber's motion to dismiss on three of the four claims in the lawsuit.
In any lawsuit, the outcome is always pure speculation, but Next Group Holdings intends to share any net proceeds from a favorable ruling with its shareholders. This is being committed to through the issuance of a special dividend of newly created Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock. NXGH shareholders are eligible to receive one share of the new class of stock for each share of NXGH common stock held as of the record date of June 10, 2016. Only non-insiders of NXGH are eligible for the special dividend.
OTC Markets shows 28.78 million shares of NXGH in the public float.
"Redeemable" stock simply means that the company is going to buy the shares back. Within six months of the final resolution of the lawsuit, Next Group will redeem the Class D preferred stock at the greater of two defined prices. On the low end, should the litigation deliver an unfavorable result, the shares will be redeemed at par value, which is fixed at $0.001 per share. This means that an investor will receive $1 for every 1,000 shares held.
Should the lawsuit result in a favorable verdict for the plaintiffs, Next Group Holdings will divide up amongst special dividend shareholders 9.03% of the net proceeds (the total amount less expenses, taxes, etc.) it receives from the judgment. In a phone conversation, Michael De Prado, President and COO of Next Group Holdings, confirmed that every brokerage house where NXGH stock is held is participating in the special dividend program. 
Upon redemption of the shares, Next Group Holdings is returning the stock to the treasury for retirement, meaning there is no dilution associated with the dividend.  
An interesting point to consider with the NXGH dividend is underscored by reports from BuyIns.net, a firm regarded as an expert provider of short-sale data. A recent report from BuyIns.net states that shorts have been "aggressively shorting NXGH on a daily basis" with an average of 33.8% of daily trading volume being short selling. If naked shorting is happening, which is always difficult to prove, requiring manual certification of ownership to receive the dividend has the potential to expose the naked shorts.
To participate in the upside of a cash redemption sent directly to a shareholder, Next Group Holdings has provided guidelines for receiving the dividend, including a simple form that must be submitted to a brokerage house to verify ownership of shares.  Interested parties can learn more about the special dividend by visiting the company's website (www.nextgroupholdings.com) and by reading the official press release on the dividend provided below.
Next Group Holdings Announces Special Dividend and New Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock
MIAMI, FL, May 27, 2016 /CNW/ - Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH) (the "Company") today announces a special dividend for shareholders. The Company has completed and filed requisite paperwork to issue a special dividend of one share of the new Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock for each share of NXGH common stock held. To receive the special dividend, NXGH shareholder need only to take the appropriate steps with their brokerage house to verify their position in the Company.
Next Group Holdings will redeem the Class D Redeemable Preferred shares from each shareholder subsequent to a court ruling in the litigation with Viber Media, Inc. ("Viber"). On May 12, 2016, our Board of Directors created a new class of Preferred Stock. The Board also declared a special stock dividend consisting of our newly designated Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the dividend, the special stock dividend will be distributed to owners of the Company's common stock as of the record date in a ratio of one share of Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock for every 1 share of common stock owned as of the record date. The Company has set the record date as June 10, 2016. The Class D Preferred Stock must be redeemed within six (6) months (or as soon thereafter as permitted by law) following final resolution of the Corporation's affiliates lawsuit against ViberMedia, Inc. (Next Communications, Inc. and NxtGn, Inc. v. Viber Media, Inc.) which is, as of the date of this resolution, pending in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York or any successor or other lawsuit relating to the subject matter thereof in which the Corporation (or any successor-in-interest) is named as a plaintiff (the "Lawsuit").
The Designation fixes the redemption price of each share of class D Preferred stock as the greater of par value or the amount obtained by dividing (a) 9.03 percent of the net proceeds to the Corporation of the Lawsuit after payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with such law suit and the resolution of any creditor claims against Next Communications and all taxes on net income accrued or paid with respect to such amount, by (b) the total number of shares of Class D Preferred stock issued and outstanding as of the Redemption Date, which amount shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. In the event of an unfavorable result, we will still redeem the Class D preferred stock at par within six months of the case's final disposition.
"This new dividend demonstrates the optimism we have about our future and our unwavering commitment to deliver value to our loyal shareholders," said Arik Maimon, NXGH's Chairman and CEO.

Next Group Holdings Announces Special Dividend and New Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock


MIAMI, FL, May 27, 2016 /CNW/ - Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH) (the "Company") today announces a special dividend for shareholders. The Company has completed and filed requisite paperwork to issue a special dividend of one share of the new Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock for each share of NXGH common stock held. To receive the special dividend, NXGH shareholder need only to take the appropriate steps with their brokerage house to verify their position in the Company.
Next Group Holdings will redeem the Class D Redeemable Preferred shares from each shareholder subsequent to a court ruling in the litigation with Viber Media, Inc. ("Viber").  On May 12, 2016, our Board of Directors created a new class of Preferred Stock. The Board also declared a special stock dividend consisting of our newly designated Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock. Pursuant to the dividend, the special stock dividend will be distributed to owners of the Company's common stock as of the record date in a ratio of one share of Class D Redeemable Preferred Stock for every 1 share of common stock owned as of the record date. The Company has set the record date as June 10, 2016. The Class D Preferred Stock must be redeemed within six (6) months (or as soon thereafter as permitted by law) following final resolution of the Corporation's affiliates lawsuit against ViberMedia, Inc. (Next Communications, Inc. and NxtGn, Inc. v. Viber Media, Inc.) which is, as of the date of this resolution, pending in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York or any successor or other lawsuit relating to the subject matter thereof in which the Corporation (or any successor-in-interest) is named as a plaintiff (the "Lawsuit").
The Designation fixes the redemption price of each share of class D Preferred stock as the greater of par value or the amount obtained by dividing (a) 9.03 percent of the net proceeds to the Corporation of the Lawsuit after payment of fees and expenses incurred in connection with such law suit and the resolution of any creditor claims against Next Communications and all taxes on net income accrued or paid with respect to such amount, by (b) the total number of shares of Class D Preferred stock issued and outstanding as of the Redemption Date, which amount shall be rounded to the nearest whole cent. In the event of an unfavorable result, we will still redeem the Class D preferred stock at par within six months of the case's final disposition.
"This new dividend demonstrates the optimism we have about our future and our unwavering commitment to deliver value to our loyal shareholders," said Arik Maimon, NXGH's Chairman and CEO. "I want to personally thank each investor and encourage everyone to verify their position in NXGH with their broker immediately to receive their dividend."
Next Group Holdings has provided the stockholder letter necessary to request the Class D preferred stock certificate from the Company free of charge at www.nextgroupholdings.com under "Investors Relations" in the main menu and "Dividend" tab.

Next Group Holdings Announces Strategic Partnership with CP+B


Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: NXGH) announced today that it has entered into a strategic partnership with Love Made Visible ("LMV"), CP+B's Product & Brand Invention Group (CP+B). They will assist NXGH's subsidiary Next CALA, Inc. ("NEXTCALA") in the design, launch and marketing of NXHG's prepaid family portfolio here at http://www.nextcala.com, along with NXGH's other subsidiary NxtGn HD video platform and telepresence products and services.
"Through our non-traditional business model, we've built an engine to generate strong valuation increases through a partnership framework that significantly mitigates risk while building irrational loyalty with our audience. We are not ad people. We are cultural change agents, brand inventors, artists, technologists, anthropologists, and everything in between. Our goal always being to disrupt conventions, not just through branding and design, but in everything we do - product development, sourcing, manufacturing & going to market. We look forward to taking a deep dive into NXGH's brands, understanding the personalities and needs of its customers and helping them connect these brands to culture in a meaningful way," said Neil Riddell, CP+B's EVP/Executive Director.
Love Made Visible has developed new agency-owned brands and partnership opportunities. These partnerships include the prospering bike-sharing system B-Cycle, the environmentally minded mechanic brand Green Garage, and the award winning spirit brands - Angel's Envy Bourbon and the Hemingway-inspired Papa's Pilar Rum. The success of these ventures has now led an expansion into other categories like lifestyle/fashion brands, natural foods, as well as the tech sector.
"Our plans to work with CP+B to disrupt the telepresence and broadcast live video landscape represents the next step in democratizing people's ability to broadcast live," said Arik Maimon, NXGH's Chairman and CEO. "We have created Intellectual Property (IP) that will put telepresence capabilities that were previously available only to Fortune 100 companies, into the hands of everyday people. This changes single point to multi-point broadcasting in a big way. It's part of what we see as an evolution from Skype (limited to 8 people), and Periscope/Meerkat (which integrates live video and texting interaction), to our platform that offers Live Video / Interactive / HD quality over very low bandwidth, and allows as many as 10,000 concurrent users a seamless interface between laptop, tablet, mobile device. With our planned technology, consumers, celebrities, politicians, and organizations will be able to publicly broadcast in HD directly to as many as 10,000 fans. Unlike our competitors' existing live video technologies, the viewers can be seen by the broadcaster and chosen to interact with by simply touching their HD video feed, creating a closer connection with their fan base."

Next Group Holdings has Entered Into an Option Agreement Allowing it to Purchase a Controlling Interest in Innovative Gaming Technologies Provider Lubar Technologies


Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTC: PLKD) announced today that, as part of its continuing efforts to maximize commercial application and usage of its NxtGn subsidiary's proprietary NxtGn AVYDA technology and its HD video network, and to accelerate revenue growth, PLKD has signed an agreement granting PLKD an exclusive option to purchase a controlling interest in Lubar Technologies, LLC.
Founded in 2002, Lubar is in the business of redefining the live gaming experience by developing and providing innovative video conferencing gaming solutions. Lubar applications allow real physical casinos located throughout the world to market their games-including blackjack, poker, roulette, and dice games, among others-to the online gaming market. Focusing on providing the best video quality, audio clarity, and usability for end users and service providers, Lubar's video conferencing gaming system transforms the way players participate in online gaming, while enabling physical casino operators profitable new services and revenue streams.
Using Lubar technology, players remotely accessing casino games from their home computers are able to see and talk with the dealer or croupier and with other players, as if they were in the casino. Using real cards, real dice, real casino equipment, and a live dealer preserves the element of randomness and enhances the experience of realism for remote gamers.
Lubar owns patents for its technology in more than 20 countries throughout the world. Information about Lubar's patents can be accessed here: http://www.lubar-tech.com/patents.html. Additional information about Lubar's products and services can be accessed here: http://www.lubar-tech.com
"If, as expected, we exercise the option," said Arik Maimon, Chairman and CEO of PLKD, "we plan to integrate certain unique features of NxtGn's proprietary AVYDA HD video technology into Lubar's products and services, making the Lubar user's experience even better."
"Deploying NxtGn AVYDA technology will give us a competitive advantage in the $30 billion per annum online gaming industry," said Yacob Rafaeli, founder and CEO of Lubar.
Under the option agreement, after completing due diligence, PLKD will have the right to acquire 78% of the membership interests in Lubar Technologies, LLC for $1,500,000, all in common shares of PLKD.

Next Group Holdings Announces Plans to Extend its Reach in the Mobile HD Video Market


Next Group Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB: PLKD) announced today that it plans to aggressively extend its market reach and subscriber base in the mobile HD video space throughout the remainder of 2016, through its subsidiary NxtGn, Inc.
NxtGn plans to launch its AVYDA Powered by Telarix mobile application for iOS devices in April 2016. The AVYDA cloud platform will allow from two people to thousands of people located all over the earth to simultaneously join video rooms to connect with friends, family members, celebrities, live entertainment events, doctors, classrooms, and more. With a heavy focus on user experience, the application will be simple to use: just click on an access link or notification to connect. The platform allows carrier service providers to monetize HD video communication, changing the landscape of how subscribers communicate with one another.
"We are very happy to see that 5 years of research and development, and relationship building, are about to make our unique new HD video platform a reality for millions of people around the world," said Michael De Prado, PLKD's President.
Mr. De Prado continued, "as our sister company NxtGn, Inc. begins to roll out several exciting new products and services, the Next CALA Rewards program will offer Next CALA subscribers the ability to use NxtGn's proprietary HD Personal Telepresence products to participate in health care consultations, distance learning, and exclusive live entertainment events. I am proud that Next CALA Rewards will soon allow our subscribers to use HD telepresence services that until recently were within reach only of Fortune 500 companies and very high net worth individuals. I believe these synergies will give both Avyda and our Next CALA Prepaid Visa cards sustainable competitive advantages in the marketplace."
