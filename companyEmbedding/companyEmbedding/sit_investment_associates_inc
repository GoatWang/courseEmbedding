This information does not constitute an offer to sell interests in any fund, nor is it intended to invite or permit the making of offers to purchase interests in a fund. Many restrictions that are customarily adopted by mutual funds have not been adopted by the private investment funds. The funds are not intended to present a balanced investment plan or a complete investment program. There can be no assurance that a fund will achieve its objectives, and a fund could have substantial declines in the value of its portfolio securities.  Investing involves risks.  Information about the qualifications and business practices of Sit Investment Associates, Inc. is available in its Form ADV Part 2A, available by contacting Sit Investment.

Sit Mutual Funds are managed by Sit Investment Associates, Inc. The Sit Mutual Funds are offered by prospectus only and sold only to persons residing in the United States. This information does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Sit Mutual Fund.  Investing involves risks.  For more information about Sit Mutual Funds please visit our Mutual Funds website at www.sitfunds.com.





Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important Fund information and may be obtained by calling Sit Mutual Funds at 1-800-332-5580 or at www.sitfunds.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost.
