If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Susan Desmond-Hellmann, MD, MPH, is an oncologist and biotechnology leader who is the Chief Executive Officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. She was previously Chancellor of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), the first woman to hold the position, and Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Distinguished Professor, and before that president of product development at Genentech, where she played a role in the development of the first gene-targeted cancer drugs, Avastin and Herceptin.

Early life and education[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann grew up in Reno, Nevada, as one of seven children. Her father worked as a pharmacist and her mother was an English teacher.[2] She earned her bachelor of science degree in pre-medicine and her medical degree from the University of Nevada, Reno and received her residency training at UCSF, where she served as chief resident. She is board-certified in internal medicine and medical oncology, and also holds a master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health.[3]
Career[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann was an associate adjunct professor of epidemiology and biostatistics At UCSF. She joined the UCSF medical faculty at the time of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in San Francisco, and therefore worked on Kaposi's sarcoma. Beginning in 1989 both she and her husband, an infectious disease doctor, spent two years as visiting faculty at the Uganda Cancer Institute, studying and treating patients with infectious diseases and Kaposi’s sarcoma in a project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.[3][2] She then spent two years in private practice.
Returning to clinical research, Desmond-Hellmann became associate director of clinical cancer research at Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute. While there, she was the project team leader for Taxol.
In 1995 she joined Genentech as a clinical scientist; she was named chief medical officer the following year, and in 1999 became executive vice president of development and product operations. From March 2004 through April 2009 she was chief of product development, playing a role in the development of two of the first gene-targeted therapies for cancer, Avastin and Herceptin.[2][3][4] She left when the company was bought out.[2][5]
From 2005 to 2008, Desmond-Hellmann served a three-year term as a member of the American Association for Cancer Research board of directors, and from 2001 to 2009, she served on the executive committee of the board of directors of the Biotechnology Industry Organization. She was elected a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2012.[6] In July 2008, she was appointed to the California Academy of Sciences Board of Trustees. She also served a three-year term on the Economic Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco beginning in January 2009.[3] She served on the corporate board of Affymetrix from 2004 to 2009[3] and on the board of Procter & Gamble in 2012–13,[7] and in 2013 was appointed to the board of Facebook.[8]
After being invited to apply, on August 3, 2009, Desmond-Hellmann became Chancellor of UCSF, the first woman to hold the position and the first drawn from outside academia.[2] She served until March 2014, holding the Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Distinguished Professorship during her tenure.[3]
In June 2010, one day after being questioned by The New York Times, Desmond-Hellmann sold her stock in the Altria Group, which owns Phillip Morris USA and other tobacco companies, and subsequently donated $134,000 to the tobacco control center at UCSF. She said that many of her holdings had been purchased on her behalf by her stockbroker and that she was too busy to oversee all her investments, although she had written the stock on her financial disclosure statement.[9][10]
In January 2012 Desmond-Hellmann proposed to change the relationship between UCSF, a health sciences university, and the University of California as a whole.[11] She proposed creating partnerships between UCSF and private pharmaceutical corporations and other sources of funding, in order to increase its revenues and solve its projected financial difficulties.[2][5][12][13]
In 2011, Desmond-Hellmann co-chaired a National Academy of Sciences committee that recommended creating a Google maps-like data network aimed at developing more diagnostics and treatments tailored to individual patients — a concept known as "precision medicine".[14] The so-called "knowledge network" would integrate the wealth of data emerging on the molecular basis of disease with information on environmental factors and patients’ electronic medical records and would allow scientists to share emerging research findings faster, thereby accelerating the development of tailored treatments. It also would allow clinicians to make more informed decisions about treatments, reduce health care costs and ultimately improve care.[15] The NAS report, titled "Toward Precision Medicine: Building a Knowledge Network for Biomedical Research and a New Taxonomy of Disease", was described by Keith Yamamoto, Vice Chancellor for Research at UCSF, as "the most important National Academy of Sciences Framework Analysis since that advisory body recommended that the United States go forward with the Human Genome Project".[16]
On December 17, 2013, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it had selected Desmond-Hellmann as its next chief executive officer.[14][4] She assumed her role on May 1, 2014, the first head of the foundation to be neither a former Microsoft executive nor a personal friend of the Gates', and the first physician.[17]
Honors[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann was named Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association Woman of the Year for 2006 and named to the Biotech Hall of Fame in 2007. She was listed among Fortune magazine’s Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Business in 2001 and from 2003 to 2008. From 2004 to 2006, the Wall Street Journal listed Desmond-Hellmann as one of its Women to Watch.
In October 2010, Desmond-Hellmann was elected a member of the Institute of Medicine and inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
In April 2012, she was honored with the Commonwealth Club of California’s 2012 Distinguished Citizen Award for her leadership at UCSF and Genentech.
Personal life[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann married Nicholas Hellmann in 1987.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann grew up in Reno, Nevada, as one of seven children. Her father worked as a pharmacist and her mother was an English teacher.[2] She earned her bachelor of science degree in pre-medicine and her medical degree from the University of Nevada, Reno and received her residency training at UCSF, where she served as chief resident. She is board-certified in internal medicine and medical oncology, and also holds a master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health.[3]
Career[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann was an associate adjunct professor of epidemiology and biostatistics At UCSF. She joined the UCSF medical faculty at the time of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in San Francisco, and therefore worked on Kaposi's sarcoma. Beginning in 1989 both she and her husband, an infectious disease doctor, spent two years as visiting faculty at the Uganda Cancer Institute, studying and treating patients with infectious diseases and Kaposi’s sarcoma in a project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.[3][2] She then spent two years in private practice.
Returning to clinical research, Desmond-Hellmann became associate director of clinical cancer research at Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute. While there, she was the project team leader for Taxol.
In 1995 she joined Genentech as a clinical scientist; she was named chief medical officer the following year, and in 1999 became executive vice president of development and product operations. From March 2004 through April 2009 she was chief of product development, playing a role in the development of two of the first gene-targeted therapies for cancer, Avastin and Herceptin.[2][3][4] She left when the company was bought out.[2][5]
From 2005 to 2008, Desmond-Hellmann served a three-year term as a member of the American Association for Cancer Research board of directors, and from 2001 to 2009, she served on the executive committee of the board of directors of the Biotechnology Industry Organization. She was elected a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2012.[6] In July 2008, she was appointed to the California Academy of Sciences Board of Trustees. She also served a three-year term on the Economic Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco beginning in January 2009.[3] She served on the corporate board of Affymetrix from 2004 to 2009[3] and on the board of Procter & Gamble in 2012–13,[7] and in 2013 was appointed to the board of Facebook.[8]
After being invited to apply, on August 3, 2009, Desmond-Hellmann became Chancellor of UCSF, the first woman to hold the position and the first drawn from outside academia.[2] She served until March 2014, holding the Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Distinguished Professorship during her tenure.[3]
In June 2010, one day after being questioned by The New York Times, Desmond-Hellmann sold her stock in the Altria Group, which owns Phillip Morris USA and other tobacco companies, and subsequently donated $134,000 to the tobacco control center at UCSF. She said that many of her holdings had been purchased on her behalf by her stockbroker and that she was too busy to oversee all her investments, although she had written the stock on her financial disclosure statement.[9][10]
In January 2012 Desmond-Hellmann proposed to change the relationship between UCSF, a health sciences university, and the University of California as a whole.[11] She proposed creating partnerships between UCSF and private pharmaceutical corporations and other sources of funding, in order to increase its revenues and solve its projected financial difficulties.[2][5][12][13]
In 2011, Desmond-Hellmann co-chaired a National Academy of Sciences committee that recommended creating a Google maps-like data network aimed at developing more diagnostics and treatments tailored to individual patients — a concept known as "precision medicine".[14] The so-called "knowledge network" would integrate the wealth of data emerging on the molecular basis of disease with information on environmental factors and patients’ electronic medical records and would allow scientists to share emerging research findings faster, thereby accelerating the development of tailored treatments. It also would allow clinicians to make more informed decisions about treatments, reduce health care costs and ultimately improve care.[15] The NAS report, titled "Toward Precision Medicine: Building a Knowledge Network for Biomedical Research and a New Taxonomy of Disease", was described by Keith Yamamoto, Vice Chancellor for Research at UCSF, as "the most important National Academy of Sciences Framework Analysis since that advisory body recommended that the United States go forward with the Human Genome Project".[16]
On December 17, 2013, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it had selected Desmond-Hellmann as its next chief executive officer.[14][4] She assumed her role on May 1, 2014, the first head of the foundation to be neither a former Microsoft executive nor a personal friend of the Gates', and the first physician.[17]
Honors[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann was named Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association Woman of the Year for 2006 and named to the Biotech Hall of Fame in 2007. She was listed among Fortune magazine’s Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Business in 2001 and from 2003 to 2008. From 2004 to 2006, the Wall Street Journal listed Desmond-Hellmann as one of its Women to Watch.
In October 2010, Desmond-Hellmann was elected a member of the Institute of Medicine and inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
In April 2012, she was honored with the Commonwealth Club of California’s 2012 Distinguished Citizen Award for her leadership at UCSF and Genentech.
Personal life[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann married Nicholas Hellmann in 1987.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann grew up in Reno, Nevada, as one of seven children. Her father worked as a pharmacist and her mother was an English teacher.[2] She earned her bachelor of science degree in pre-medicine and her medical degree from the University of Nevada, Reno and received her residency training at UCSF, where she served as chief resident. She is board-certified in internal medicine and medical oncology, and also holds a master's degree in public health from the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health.[3]
Career[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann was an associate adjunct professor of epidemiology and biostatistics At UCSF. She joined the UCSF medical faculty at the time of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in San Francisco, and therefore worked on Kaposi's sarcoma. Beginning in 1989 both she and her husband, an infectious disease doctor, spent two years as visiting faculty at the Uganda Cancer Institute, studying and treating patients with infectious diseases and Kaposi’s sarcoma in a project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation.[3][2] She then spent two years in private practice.
Returning to clinical research, Desmond-Hellmann became associate director of clinical cancer research at Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute. While there, she was the project team leader for Taxol.
In 1995 she joined Genentech as a clinical scientist; she was named chief medical officer the following year, and in 1999 became executive vice president of development and product operations. From March 2004 through April 2009 she was chief of product development, playing a role in the development of two of the first gene-targeted therapies for cancer, Avastin and Herceptin.[2][3][4] She left when the company was bought out.[2][5]
From 2005 to 2008, Desmond-Hellmann served a three-year term as a member of the American Association for Cancer Research board of directors, and from 2001 to 2009, she served on the executive committee of the board of directors of the Biotechnology Industry Organization. She was elected a trustee of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in 2012.[6] In July 2008, she was appointed to the California Academy of Sciences Board of Trustees. She also served a three-year term on the Economic Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco beginning in January 2009.[3] She served on the corporate board of Affymetrix from 2004 to 2009[3] and on the board of Procter & Gamble in 2012–13,[7] and in 2013 was appointed to the board of Facebook.[8]
After being invited to apply, on August 3, 2009, Desmond-Hellmann became Chancellor of UCSF, the first woman to hold the position and the first drawn from outside academia.[2] She served until March 2014, holding the Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Distinguished Professorship during her tenure.[3]
In June 2010, one day after being questioned by The New York Times, Desmond-Hellmann sold her stock in the Altria Group, which owns Phillip Morris USA and other tobacco companies, and subsequently donated $134,000 to the tobacco control center at UCSF. She said that many of her holdings had been purchased on her behalf by her stockbroker and that she was too busy to oversee all her investments, although she had written the stock on her financial disclosure statement.[9][10]
In January 2012 Desmond-Hellmann proposed to change the relationship between UCSF, a health sciences university, and the University of California as a whole.[11] She proposed creating partnerships between UCSF and private pharmaceutical corporations and other sources of funding, in order to increase its revenues and solve its projected financial difficulties.[2][5][12][13]
In 2011, Desmond-Hellmann co-chaired a National Academy of Sciences committee that recommended creating a Google maps-like data network aimed at developing more diagnostics and treatments tailored to individual patients — a concept known as "precision medicine".[14] The so-called "knowledge network" would integrate the wealth of data emerging on the molecular basis of disease with information on environmental factors and patients’ electronic medical records and would allow scientists to share emerging research findings faster, thereby accelerating the development of tailored treatments. It also would allow clinicians to make more informed decisions about treatments, reduce health care costs and ultimately improve care.[15] The NAS report, titled "Toward Precision Medicine: Building a Knowledge Network for Biomedical Research and a New Taxonomy of Disease", was described by Keith Yamamoto, Vice Chancellor for Research at UCSF, as "the most important National Academy of Sciences Framework Analysis since that advisory body recommended that the United States go forward with the Human Genome Project".[16]
On December 17, 2013, The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it had selected Desmond-Hellmann as its next chief executive officer.[14][4] She assumed her role on May 1, 2014, the first head of the foundation to be neither a former Microsoft executive nor a personal friend of the Gates', and the first physician.[17]
Honors[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann was named Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association Woman of the Year for 2006 and named to the Biotech Hall of Fame in 2007. She was listed among Fortune magazine’s Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Business in 2001 and from 2003 to 2008. From 2004 to 2006, the Wall Street Journal listed Desmond-Hellmann as one of its Women to Watch.
In October 2010, Desmond-Hellmann was elected a member of the Institute of Medicine and inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
In April 2012, she was honored with the Commonwealth Club of California’s 2012 Distinguished Citizen Award for her leadership at UCSF and Genentech.
Personal life[edit]
Desmond-Hellmann married Nicholas Hellmann in 1987.[2]

SEATTLE (December 17, 2013) — The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has selected Susan Desmond-Hellmann, M.D., M.P.H., as its next chief executive officer. Currently the chancellor of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Desmond-Hellmann will assume her role on May 1, 2014. 
"We chose Sue because of her scientific knowledge and deep technical expertise on the foundation’s issues, as well as the organizational and leadership skills required to lead a large, growing and dynamic global organization. Sue shares our commitment and passion to create a more equitable world," said Melinda Gates, co-chair of the foundation. 
 “I am honored by the opportunity that Bill and Melinda have extended to me. I’m excited to join such a dynamic and ambitious organization, with such a clear and focused mission—improving the lives of the world’s most vulnerable,” said Desmond-Hellmann.
"Sue’s background in public health policy, research and development, and higher education, make her an exceptional fit for this role. She impressed us as an innovator and an outstanding leader and manager," said Bill Gates, co-chair of the foundation. 
An oncologist by training, Desmond-Hellmann is a recognized leader on issues of higher education, public health, drug development, regulatory innovation and health policy. She has led UCSF since August 2009, when she became the first woman to serve as the university’s chancellor, overseeing all aspects of the university and medical center’s strategy, academic programs and operations. She has extensive experience in product development, and a deep understanding of how to bridge applied research to delivery of product. Prior to her tenure at UCSF, she was President of Product Development at Genentech, where she led the development and introduction of two of the first gene-targeted therapies for cancer, Avastin and Herceptin. 
Desmond-Hellmann also served as a member of Genentech’s executive committee, beginning in 1996. She sits on the boards of directors of Procter and Gamble and Facebook, and was previously a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s Economic Advisory Council. 
Desmond-Hellmann will take over from Jeff Raikes, who announced his retirement from the foundation in September 2013 after five years at the helm. He was the foundation's second CEO, and served after a long and successful career as a senior executive at Microsoft.

Susan Desmond-Hellmann
from Nature Reviews Drug Discovery


From Uganda to San Francisco, the president of Product Development at Genentech describes her 'chaotic' career





















By her own admission, Susan Desmond-Hellmann has had a "chaotic" career path, but she believes that the skills and experience she has amassed along the way have allowed her to do what's really important to her  to get better drugs to cancer patients. It is clear that she has tremendous respect and regard for cancer sufferers and, as President of Product Development at Genentech, she really is making an impact on their treatment. Since joining the company in 1995 she has been credited by Genentech colleagues and outsiders alike as the key force behind the development of several innovative new anticancer drugs.
As an intern at the University of California in San Francisco (UCSF), USA, Desmond-Hellmann became interested in cancer research and undertook a fellowship in oncology. But unlike many of her peers who went into the lab, she chose to do her research project in the clinic, and obtained a Masters degree in Public Health, focusing on epidemiology and biostatistics. Around the same time, there was a rise in HIV-associated malignancies in San Francisco and so she chose to investigate the epidemiological aspects of Kaposi's sarcoma. On her return to the UCSF faculty, the Rockefeller Foundation asked Desmond-Hellmann and her husband, an infectious diseases doctor at UCSF, to move to Uganda to study heterosexual transmission of HIV. They jumped at the opportunity, and spent 2 years researching and teaching at Makere University in Kampala. "It was a fantastic experience," she says. "It was challenging, but there's a wonderful medical community in Uganda and we felt the work was important and meaningful."
Arriving back at UCSF, however, Desmond-Hellmann says things had changed. "We didn't have much of a career left, truth be told!" Feeling overwhelmed by starting from scratch with little mentorship or support at the university, she and her husband moved to Kentucky to do private practice. But Desmond-Hellmann soon became frustrated at the lack of treatment options for her cancer patients and was driven to do something about it. "I loved my patients but did not enjoy private practice. I thought it was the wrong job for me. We needed better weapons against cancer and I wanted to be a part of that." So when Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) recruited her husband to work on one of their HIV drugs, Desmond-Hellmann joined the company's oncology team to work on the development of Taxol for breast cancer.
There, she felt she had finally found her true vocation. "I absolutely loved it! It was a great fit for my skills. I was working with Marcel Rozencweig, Renzo Canetta and Steve Carter, who, in my mind, were the architects of the chemotherapy I had been using in the clinic. They really knew how to develop drugs and conduct clinical trials to get a cancer drug approved."
After 2 years of what she admits was a steep learning curve at BMS, Desmond-Hellmann got the call from Genentech. "Fred Desauvage and Dan Eaton had just identified thrombopoietin as a key mediator of making platelets, and I was asked to take it into the clinic," she recalls. "I was so struck by the beautiful research and how science-driven Genentech was  and, frankly, it was also a chance to come back home." So in 1995 she and her husband moved back to California, where she took up a clinical scientist position.
Desmond-Hellmann thrived in the 'start-up' atmosphere of Genentech and quickly worked her way up the executive ladder via several senior clinical positions before taking on her current role in March 2004. She thinks her 'try anything' attitude and passion for helping cancer patients are the reason for her success. "When I did a rotation in oncology I was struck by how wonderful and brave cancer patients are. It's a life-changing moment for someone to be told they have cancer. So I feel this incredible commitment to being part of something that can help them."
What advice would she give to others wanting to follow her career path? "Do something you're passionate about and that challenges you. Ask yourself 'What will I learn from this?' Every day I learn something new at Genentech, and even though I didn't have a very well laid out career path, I think I've learned and benefited from everything I did."
Desmond-Hellmann has been nominated as a 'Woman to Watch' by The Wall Street Journal and one of the 'Most Powerful Women in Business' by Fortune magazine. Does the frequent mention of being a woman in science become an irritation? "A fellow female vice president and I were often asked to have panel discussions of what it's like to be a female scientist, and we just dreaded them!" she says. "It just seemed silly and contrived. But my feelings about it have evolved over the past several years, and I'm now more willing to have people point out that it's unusual to be a female senior executive in R&D." This willingness to be more visible comes from women telling her that they lacked female role models to aspire to. "I realized that 1520 years ago when I was starting out, there was no one for me to look up to." Instead she took inspiration from her parents: her father, a pharmacist, encouraged her interest in science and medicine, and she credits her mother, a former English teacher, with teaching her about leadership and the importance of good communication.
Desmond-Hellmann says the only low point of her career was the 'heartbreaking' decision to leave private practice. "But I promised my patients I would try my hardest to do my best for many, many cancer patients instead." She has certainly kept that promise, but she's not done yet. "The sense that we have to do better hasn't changed," she says, "because we have to improve things for cancer sufferers."

A History of UCSF



People
SUSAN DESMOND-HELLMAN (1958-)

Susan Desmond-Hellmann, MD, MPH, was born in Napa, California. Her father, a pharmacist, and mother, a teacher, raised the family of seven children in Reno, Nevada.


Desmond-Hellmann earned a Bachelor of Science degree at the University of Nevada, Reno in 1978 where she majored in pre-medicine. She continued on at UNR to earn her medical degree, graduating in 1982. Desmond-Hellmann later earned a master's degree in public health from UC Berkeley.


Desmond-Hellmann first came to UCSF in 1982 as an intern—an experience she says "transformed her" — and later served as chief resident. After completing her clinical training, she joined the UCSF faculty as associate adjunct professor of epidemiology and biostatistics and served two years as visiting faculty at the Uganda Cancer Institute, studying HIV/AIDS and cancer. Desmond-Hellmann then spent two years as a medical oncologist in private practice and afterward returned to clinical research.


Desmond-Hellmann worked for Genentech from 1995-2009, first as a clinical scientist. She was named chief medical officer in 1996 and executive vice president of development and product operations in 1999. Desmond-Hellmann served as president of product development at Genentech from March 2004-2009 and was responsible for preclinical and clinical development, process research and development, business development and product portfolio management.


In August of 2009, Desmond-Hellmann was named UCSF's ninth chancellor and became the first woman to hold the post. As chancellor, Desmond-Hellmann was actively involved in shaping biomedical policy and served as a member of the National Institutes of Health's advisory committee on the National Center for Advancing Translational Science. She also championed the new field of precision medicine, putting it on the roadmap for UCSF and the nation. To that end, in 2011 Desmond-Hellmann co-chaired a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) committee that produced the report, "Toward Precision Medicine: Building a Knowledge Network for Biomedical Research and a New Taxonomy of Disease." 


She led the OME Precision Medicine Summit at UCSF Mission Bay in May 2013, a first-of-its-kind conference, which drew 170 of the world's foremost thinkers, creators and innovators in detailed discussions on how to medicine more proactive, preventive and precise.


Under her leadership and guidance, UCSF's excellence in patient care, research and education, and its public mission grew along with its size.  UCSF's Mission Bay campus continued to thrive, adding the $1.5 billion state-of-the-art UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay, which allowed for expansion of patient care services for women, children and cancer patients. "Mission Bay gives us new space and new opportunities for programs and to bring in new faculty," said Desmond-Hellmann. "It has allowed us to execute our mission of advancing health worldwide™ in ways that had been constrained. It's a huge uplift for everything we care about."


Desmond-Hellmann stepped down from chancellor of UCSF in March of 2014 to become the chief executive officer of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Praising Desmond-Hellmann's contributions to UCSF, UC President Janet Napolitano said: "With acrobatic precision, the Chancellor developed and executed an ambitious and creative vision for the campus, while navigating it through one of the worst fiscal crises in UC's history. She has been a champion of diversity, transparency and public service. Development of the [UCSF] Benioff Children's Hospital and her innovations in health care delivery are but two examples of her impact, not just on UCSF but also on the community it serves and within the broader realm of global health."


Desmond-Hellmann has garnered many distinctions. She was listed in Fortune magazine's "Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Business" in 2001 and from 2003-2008, listed as a "Woman to Watch" by the Wall Street Journal from 2004-2006, Healthcare Businesswomen's Association 2006 "Woman of the Year," named to the Biotech Hall of Fame in 2007, was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and elected to the Institute of Medicine in 2010, and awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Princeton University in 2011.
