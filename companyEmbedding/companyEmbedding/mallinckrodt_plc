History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1867, the Mallinckrodt brothers, Gustav, Otto and Edward, founded G. Mallinckrodt & Co. in St. Louis, Missouri.[4] The Mallinckrodt family had immigrated from Germany, and Otto and Edward both returned to Germany, the leader in chemistry at the time, for advanced training.[5] Mallinckrodt Chemical Works was incorporated 15 years later. By 1898, the company had established itself as a pharmaceuticals supplier and in 1913 became the first to introduce barium sulfate as a contrast medium for x-rays.[4]
In part due to early success in production of radiology agents, and at the behest of surgeon Evarts Graham, Edward Mallinckrodt Sr. assigned one of the company's top chemists to collaborate in developing the first radiographic agent for gallbladder and bile duct imaging.[6] A posthumous endowment by Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. on behalf of his father to the Washington University medical school radiology department resulted in the creation of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology.[7]
Nuclear waste in St. Louis, Missouri[edit]
Henry Farr and John Ruhoff, technical managers for Mallinckrodt, Inc. were directed by Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. to develop a chemical process for purifying large quantities of uranium.[8] Uranium purified by Mallinckrodt was used at the University of Chicago Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear chain reaction. Mallinckrodt also contributed uranium to the Manhattan Project, producing fissionable materials used in the atomic weapons detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From 1942 to 1957 Mallinckrodt purified 50,000 short tons (45,000,000 kg) of uranium products at various locations in and around the city of St. Louis.[9] The waste was secretly dumped on Coldwater Creek and in various St. Louis suburbs, including Berkeley, Hazelwood, Bridgeton, and Weldon Spring with the approval of the federal government, which is now[when?] taking financial responsibility for the cleanup.[10] The dumping substantially contaminated Coldwater Creek.
Cleanup efforts are now[when?] underway by the Army Corps of Engineers.[11] Cleanup sites include the St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS), where uranium was refined; the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS), where waste produced at SLDS was stored; the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), where waste from SLAPS was relocated; and the St. Louis Airport Site Vicinity Properties (SLAPS VPs), areas where contamination was caused by relocation of waste. Additional nuclear waste was also deposited at the West Lake Landfill, which has now[when?] been designated a Superfund site. Various buildings have been decontaminated and demolished and nuclear material has been excavated and shipped out of St. Louis by covered rail as part of the cleanup process, yet more nuclear waste remains in and around St. Louis.

Market[edit]
Mallinckrodt markets its products to major wholesalers and retail drug store chains. Imaging products are marketed primarily to physicians, technologists and hospitals, imaging centers, cardiology clinics and radiopharmacies.[3]
Products[edit]
Mallinckrodt has two main product lines.[28]

Specialty Pharmaceuticals products include branded drugs as well as specialty generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Products include biologics, medicinal opioids, synthetic controlled substances, and acetominophen.
Medical Imaging products include contrast media and radiopharmaceuticals for medical imaging applications.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, Specialty Pharmaceuticals accounted for 74% of net sales. Key specialty pharmaceutical products include[28]

Acthar gel, an injectable biopharmaceutical used for the treatment of infantile spasms, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, and certain orphan diseases. Mallinckrodt acquired this product via its acquisition of Questcor Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[29] When Questcor acquired the drug in 2001 it sold for $40 a vial; within a year of the acquisition Questcor raised the price of the drug to $1,500 per vial and to $28,000 by 2013.[30] In 2013, Questcor acquired the US rights to a competing product, Synacthen Depot, from Novartis.[30] In 2014 Mallinckrodt raised the price of Acthar further to $34,000.[31] The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general from five states sued Mallinckrodt for anti-competitive behavior with regard to the acquisition of Synacthen Depot and the monopolistic pricing of Acthar, and in January 2017 the company settled, agreeing to pay $100 million and to license Synacthen Depot to a competitor.[29]
Offirmev is a proprietary IV formulation of acetominophen used in conjunction with opioid painkillers in the post surgical setting.
Xartemis XR is a controlled release oral combination of acetominophen and oxycodone for the treatment of acute pain.
Exalgo is a once-daily, long-acting form of hydromorphone, another pain drug.

Key generic specialty products include:[28]

Hydrocodone API and tablets
Oxycodone API and tablets
Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release tablets
Dextroamphetamine sulfate controlled release tablets
Other controlled substances, including acetominophen-containing products

Medical Imaging products include Optiray (ioversol injection), an iodide based contrast medium for CT scans, and Optimark (gadoversetamide injection) a Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent used in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain or liver.
As of 1988, Mallinckrodt was the only company in the US that is allowed to receive cocaine, which it has used to make cocaine hydrochloride, a prescription drug used in hospitals as a local anesthetic by eye and ear, nose and throat doctors.[13]

From 1942 to 1957 Mallinckrodt purified 50,000 short tons (45,000,000 kg) of uranium products at various locations in and around the city of St. Louis.[9] The waste was secretly dumped on Coldwater Creek and in various St. Louis suburbs, including Berkeley, Hazelwood, Bridgeton, and Weldon Spring with the approval of the federal government, which is now[when?] taking financial responsibility for the cleanup.[10] The dumping substantially contaminated Coldwater Creek.
Cleanup efforts are now[when?] underway by the Army Corps of Engineers.[11] Cleanup sites include the St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS), where uranium was refined; the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS), where waste produced at SLDS was stored; the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), where waste from SLAPS was relocated; and the St. Louis Airport Site Vicinity Properties (SLAPS VPs), areas where contamination was caused by relocation of waste. Additional nuclear waste was also deposited at the West Lake Landfill, which has now[when?] been designated a Superfund site. Various buildings have been decontaminated and demolished and nuclear material has been excavated and shipped out of St. Louis by covered rail as part of the cleanup process, yet more nuclear waste remains in and around St. Louis.

Market[edit]
Mallinckrodt markets its products to major wholesalers and retail drug store chains. Imaging products are marketed primarily to physicians, technologists and hospitals, imaging centers, cardiology clinics and radiopharmacies.[3]
Products[edit]
Mallinckrodt has two main product lines.[28]

Specialty Pharmaceuticals products include branded drugs as well as specialty generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Products include biologics, medicinal opioids, synthetic controlled substances, and acetominophen.
Medical Imaging products include contrast media and radiopharmaceuticals for medical imaging applications.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, Specialty Pharmaceuticals accounted for 74% of net sales. Key specialty pharmaceutical products include[28]

Acthar gel, an injectable biopharmaceutical used for the treatment of infantile spasms, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, and certain orphan diseases. Mallinckrodt acquired this product via its acquisition of Questcor Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[29] When Questcor acquired the drug in 2001 it sold for $40 a vial; within a year of the acquisition Questcor raised the price of the drug to $1,500 per vial and to $28,000 by 2013.[30] In 2013, Questcor acquired the US rights to a competing product, Synacthen Depot, from Novartis.[30] In 2014 Mallinckrodt raised the price of Acthar further to $34,000.[31] The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general from five states sued Mallinckrodt for anti-competitive behavior with regard to the acquisition of Synacthen Depot and the monopolistic pricing of Acthar, and in January 2017 the company settled, agreeing to pay $100 million and to license Synacthen Depot to a competitor.[29]
Offirmev is a proprietary IV formulation of acetominophen used in conjunction with opioid painkillers in the post surgical setting.
Xartemis XR is a controlled release oral combination of acetominophen and oxycodone for the treatment of acute pain.
Exalgo is a once-daily, long-acting form of hydromorphone, another pain drug.

Key generic specialty products include:[28]

Hydrocodone API and tablets
Oxycodone API and tablets
Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release tablets
Dextroamphetamine sulfate controlled release tablets
Other controlled substances, including acetominophen-containing products

Medical Imaging products include Optiray (ioversol injection), an iodide based contrast medium for CT scans, and Optimark (gadoversetamide injection) a Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent used in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain or liver.
As of 1988, Mallinckrodt was the only company in the US that is allowed to receive cocaine, which it has used to make cocaine hydrochloride, a prescription drug used in hospitals as a local anesthetic by eye and ear, nose and throat doctors.[13]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1867, the Mallinckrodt brothers, Gustav, Otto and Edward, founded G. Mallinckrodt & Co. in St. Louis, Missouri.[4] The Mallinckrodt family had immigrated from Germany, and Otto and Edward both returned to Germany, the leader in chemistry at the time, for advanced training.[5] Mallinckrodt Chemical Works was incorporated 15 years later. By 1898, the company had established itself as a pharmaceuticals supplier and in 1913 became the first to introduce barium sulfate as a contrast medium for x-rays.[4]
In part due to early success in production of radiology agents, and at the behest of surgeon Evarts Graham, Edward Mallinckrodt Sr. assigned one of the company's top chemists to collaborate in developing the first radiographic agent for gallbladder and bile duct imaging.[6] A posthumous endowment by Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. on behalf of his father to the Washington University medical school radiology department resulted in the creation of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology.[7]
Nuclear waste in St. Louis, Missouri[edit]
Henry Farr and John Ruhoff, technical managers for Mallinckrodt, Inc. were directed by Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. to develop a chemical process for purifying large quantities of uranium.[8] Uranium purified by Mallinckrodt was used at the University of Chicago Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear chain reaction. Mallinckrodt also contributed uranium to the Manhattan Project, producing fissionable materials used in the atomic weapons detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From 1942 to 1957 Mallinckrodt purified 50,000 short tons (45,000,000 kg) of uranium products at various locations in and around the city of St. Louis.[9] The waste was secretly dumped on Coldwater Creek and in various St. Louis suburbs, including Berkeley, Hazelwood, Bridgeton, and Weldon Spring with the approval of the federal government, which is now[when?] taking financial responsibility for the cleanup.[10] The dumping substantially contaminated Coldwater Creek.
Cleanup efforts are now[when?] underway by the Army Corps of Engineers.[11] Cleanup sites include the St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS), where uranium was refined; the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS), where waste produced at SLDS was stored; the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), where waste from SLAPS was relocated; and the St. Louis Airport Site Vicinity Properties (SLAPS VPs), areas where contamination was caused by relocation of waste. Additional nuclear waste was also deposited at the West Lake Landfill, which has now[when?] been designated a Superfund site. Various buildings have been decontaminated and demolished and nuclear material has been excavated and shipped out of St. Louis by covered rail as part of the cleanup process, yet more nuclear waste remains in and around St. Louis.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1867, the Mallinckrodt brothers, Gustav, Otto and Edward, founded G. Mallinckrodt & Co. in St. Louis, Missouri.[4] The Mallinckrodt family had immigrated from Germany, and Otto and Edward both returned to Germany, the leader in chemistry at the time, for advanced training.[5] Mallinckrodt Chemical Works was incorporated 15 years later. By 1898, the company had established itself as a pharmaceuticals supplier and in 1913 became the first to introduce barium sulfate as a contrast medium for x-rays.[4]
In part due to early success in production of radiology agents, and at the behest of surgeon Evarts Graham, Edward Mallinckrodt Sr. assigned one of the company's top chemists to collaborate in developing the first radiographic agent for gallbladder and bile duct imaging.[6] A posthumous endowment by Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. on behalf of his father to the Washington University medical school radiology department resulted in the creation of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology.[7]
Nuclear waste in St. Louis, Missouri[edit]
Henry Farr and John Ruhoff, technical managers for Mallinckrodt, Inc. were directed by Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. to develop a chemical process for purifying large quantities of uranium.[8] Uranium purified by Mallinckrodt was used at the University of Chicago Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear chain reaction. Mallinckrodt also contributed uranium to the Manhattan Project, producing fissionable materials used in the atomic weapons detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From 1942 to 1957 Mallinckrodt purified 50,000 short tons (45,000,000 kg) of uranium products at various locations in and around the city of St. Louis.[9] The waste was secretly dumped on Coldwater Creek and in various St. Louis suburbs, including Berkeley, Hazelwood, Bridgeton, and Weldon Spring with the approval of the federal government, which is now[when?] taking financial responsibility for the cleanup.[10] The dumping substantially contaminated Coldwater Creek.
Cleanup efforts are now[when?] underway by the Army Corps of Engineers.[11] Cleanup sites include the St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS), where uranium was refined; the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS), where waste produced at SLDS was stored; the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), where waste from SLAPS was relocated; and the St. Louis Airport Site Vicinity Properties (SLAPS VPs), areas where contamination was caused by relocation of waste. Additional nuclear waste was also deposited at the West Lake Landfill, which has now[when?] been designated a Superfund site. Various buildings have been decontaminated and demolished and nuclear material has been excavated and shipped out of St. Louis by covered rail as part of the cleanup process, yet more nuclear waste remains in and around St. Louis.

Market[edit]
Mallinckrodt markets its products to major wholesalers and retail drug store chains. Imaging products are marketed primarily to physicians, technologists and hospitals, imaging centers, cardiology clinics and radiopharmacies.[3]
Products[edit]
Mallinckrodt has two main product lines.[28]

Specialty Pharmaceuticals products include branded drugs as well as specialty generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Products include biologics, medicinal opioids, synthetic controlled substances, and acetominophen.
Medical Imaging products include contrast media and radiopharmaceuticals for medical imaging applications.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, Specialty Pharmaceuticals accounted for 74% of net sales. Key specialty pharmaceutical products include[28]

Acthar gel, an injectable biopharmaceutical used for the treatment of infantile spasms, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, and certain orphan diseases. Mallinckrodt acquired this product via its acquisition of Questcor Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[29] When Questcor acquired the drug in 2001 it sold for $40 a vial; within a year of the acquisition Questcor raised the price of the drug to $1,500 per vial and to $28,000 by 2013.[30] In 2013, Questcor acquired the US rights to a competing product, Synacthen Depot, from Novartis.[30] In 2014 Mallinckrodt raised the price of Acthar further to $34,000.[31] The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general from five states sued Mallinckrodt for anti-competitive behavior with regard to the acquisition of Synacthen Depot and the monopolistic pricing of Acthar, and in January 2017 the company settled, agreeing to pay $100 million and to license Synacthen Depot to a competitor.[29]
Offirmev is a proprietary IV formulation of acetominophen used in conjunction with opioid painkillers in the post surgical setting.
Xartemis XR is a controlled release oral combination of acetominophen and oxycodone for the treatment of acute pain.
Exalgo is a once-daily, long-acting form of hydromorphone, another pain drug.

Key generic specialty products include:[28]

Hydrocodone API and tablets
Oxycodone API and tablets
Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release tablets
Dextroamphetamine sulfate controlled release tablets
Other controlled substances, including acetominophen-containing products

Medical Imaging products include Optiray (ioversol injection), an iodide based contrast medium for CT scans, and Optimark (gadoversetamide injection) a Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent used in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain or liver.
As of 1988, Mallinckrodt was the only company in the US that is allowed to receive cocaine, which it has used to make cocaine hydrochloride, a prescription drug used in hospitals as a local anesthetic by eye and ear, nose and throat doctors.[13]

Mallinckrodt Post-FTC Settlement: Buy The Dip Or Valeant-Lite? - Mallinckrodt PLC (NYSE:MNK) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Mallinckrodt Post-FTC Settlement: Buy The Dip Or Valeant-Lite?Jan.19.17 | About: Mallinckrodt PLC (MNK) DoctoRx Special situations, growth at reasonable price, value, micro-capSummaryMallinckrodt plc, an old-line US company that transformed to a pharma roll-up, announced a settlement with the FTC and five states related to its Acthar product.The settlement only cost $100 million, or less than $1/share; the stock sold off more than that in market value.The other settlement concession from Mallinckrodt involved disposing of a potential competitor to Acthar; this is discussed in detail in the article.The company's financial situation and other potential value drivers are also analyzed.My conclusion is that Mallinckrodt stock, looked at comprehensively, is not cheap enough given the risks to its dominant Acthar franchise or its general business model.Introduction Over the past few years of covering biotech and specialty pharma stocks, I've had nothing to say publicly about one of the more prominent and interesting ones, Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE:MNK). This Irish company was spun out of Covidien, now a subsidiary of Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT). A number of people have e-mailed me privately about it, and I always expressed caution about it. MNK has now come to the fore after a high-profile settlement with the Federal Trade Commission as well as five states. In the complaint filed by the FTC and states, the first point reads this way:    I. Nature of the Case 1.Through its anticompetitive conduct, Questcor [now part of MNK] has extinguished a nascent competitive threat to its monopoly. Questcor's H.P. Acthar Gel ("Acthar") is the only therapeutic adrenocorticotropic hormone ("ACTH") product sold in the United States. ACTH is the standard of care for infantile spasms ("IS"), a rare but extremely serious disorder involving seizures within the first two years of life. It is also used to treat nephrotic syndrome ("NS") - a kidney disorder whose largest single cause is idiopathic membranous nephropathy ("IMN") - as well as other disorders.  So this is an antitrust allegation, now settled for $100 MM and a remedy to be discussed below. The inflammatory nature of the charges comprises the next two points by the plaintiffs:
    2. Questcor acquired Acthar from Aventis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in 2001 for $100,000 plus modest royalties. At that time, the price of Acthar was $40 per vial. Questcor has since raised Acthar's price to over $34,000 per vial-an 85,000% increase. 3. A course of Acthar treatment for IS requires multiple vials and can cost well over $100,000... 5. Questcor's Acthar price increases have persisted and proved very profitable. Acthar's U.S. revenues in 2015 exceeded $1 billion.  Both lay the predicate for why allegedly the defendant acted as it did, and would be an appeal to emotion in a jury trial. The complaint then gets to the alleged act of wrongdoing, as well as providing important background to the future competitive threats to Acthar:    6. In Europe, Canada, and other parts of the world, doctors treat patients suffering from these same conditions with Synacthen Depot ("Synacthen"), a synthetic ACTH drug. Although Acthar is a natural ACTH drug derived from the pituitary glands of pigs, Acthar and Synacthen have very similar biological activities and pharmacological effects. As the Canadian product monograph for Synacthen reads, "SYNACTHEN... exhibits the same activity as natural ACTH with regard to all its biological activities." Questcor considers the drugs so similar that it submitted Synacthen information to support its application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") to expand the label indications for Acthar and cited Synacthen studies in its Acthar marketing materials. 7. Until June 2013, Novartis AG ("Novartis") marketed and sold Synacthen abroad. 8. In 2011, Novartis decided to sell the rights to market Synacthen in the United States. For years, Questcor had viewed Synacthen as a significant potential competitive threat to Acthar. In June 2013, Questcor outbid other companies to acquire the U.S. rights to Synacthen. Questcor's participation in the bidding process was a defensive move designed to protect its monopoly over ACTH drugs in the United States. By acquiring Synacthen, Questcor harmed competition by preventing another bidder from trying to develop the drug and launch it in the United States to challenge Questcor's monopoly over ACTH drugs. 
 While Martin Shkreli's company at the time, Retrophin, was outbid by over $100 MM by Questcor and complained, the deal by Questcor, which was public at the time, raised a lot of eyebrows. As the NYT headlined and reported contemporaneously:    Questcor Pays $135 Million to Acquire Rights to a Competitor's Drug A pharmaceutical company that has reaped huge profits by selling a 60-year-old drug for $28,000 a vial has eliminated the most obvious threat of competition from a much cheaper drug by acquiring the rights to it. The company, Questcor Pharmaceuticals, has acquired the rights to Synacthen, a drug from Novartis, that is sold in Europe but not in the United States. Synacthen is similar to Questcor's drug, which is called H.P. Acthar Gel and used to treat various immune-related ailments. Questcor's agreement to pay Novartis at least $135 million trumped a bid from a start-up company called Retrophin that had hoped to sell Synacthen in the United States for a few hundred dollars a vial, sharply undercutting Acthar's price, according to people briefed on Retrophin's negotiations. Questcor's stock shot up 15 percent on Tuesday, the day its deal to acquire Synacthen was announced. "We believe the acquisition removes a key overhang as a potential competitor to Acthar is removed," Biren Amin, an analyst at Jefferies & Company, wrote in a note. One antitrust lawyer, not involved in the negotiations, predicted the deal would receive "intense scrutiny" by federal antitrust regulators.  Now, all that is the plaintiff's side of things. The Times has a certain point of view, and so does the Obama administration. There are two points to make quickly about the facts of the case that may explain the wrist slap here, only a dollar a share of MNK stock. Note that MNK acquired Questcor for $5.6 B in a 2014 deal. One point is that, going back to #2 in the complaint, the price increases to nearly $30,000 per vial occurred in 2008, long before the Novartis (NYSE:NVS) deal. The second point comes from that Times article, providing some balance:
 Novartis can revoke the rights if Questcor does not meet deadlines in terms of testing Synacthen in clinical trials and seeking approval to market it in the United States, according to a regulatory filing by Questcor. The deadlines are not being made public. This would potentially be very important in a lawsuit and may explain why the FTC and states settled. That Times article went on, late in the article, to present the company's side of things:    Mr. Cartt of Questcor said the company would spend millions of dollars testing Synacthen to see if it could help American patients. "That is the essence of discovery and competition, not their elimination," he said in an e-mail. In the past Questcor executives have disparaged Synacthen. "We believe it is unlikely to be a competitor to Acthar," David Young, Questcor's chief scientific officer, said in a call with analysts last July. He said it was not a protein produced by the body like Acthar was and added, "Synacthen contains benzyl alcohol, which is toxic to children and can potentially cause gasping syndrome, which can be fatal."  Since probably over 80% of Mallinckrodt's profits come from Acthar, it makes sense to review the sales and prospects for it before doubling back to focus on MNK's balance sheet and the rest of its product line and pipeline. It now makes sense to mention the other important part of the settlement. This is that within 120 days, MNK will license Synacthen in the US royalty-free with no minimum price for the license to a company approved by the government. So one of the key questions is whether Synacthen will destroy, or at least harm, Acthar's business prospects. How Acthar became a blockbuster This is a strange story. The Times began covering it in a long 2012 article. In brief, Acthar H.P. (highly purified) is a porcine product that was developed around the time that oral steroids were also being developed. Its first version was developed by Armour, the meatpacker, which was trying to find profit out of all parts of the pig. It was able to extract the hormone that stimulates the adrenal cortex to make cortisone and other steroid hormones; this stimulating hormone has the ACTH acronym, thus accounting for the name. Over time, as oral steroids such as prednisone, prednisolone, and others became widely available and then cheap generics, Acthar had few uses. That's because the theory of Acthar's actions is that it is just a stimulant to adrenal gland production of other steroids, largely glucocorticoids, and prednisone and the others of its class do the job more simply, and are given by mouth rather than by injection.
 However, Acthar was felt to be effective, along with Sabril and high-dose steroids, for an ultra-orphan condition, infantile spasms. It is also approved for treatment of an acute exacerbation of multiple sclerosis in adults, and for numerous other autoimmune indications. One of the points that is omitted from what might be called the anti-Acthar contingent, and Questcor was controversial, attracting such short-sellers as Andrew Left and Citron is that the FDA did a review of Acthar in the 1970s and updated its label. From the 2015 10-K, p. 28: In the 1970s, the FDA reviewed the safety and efficacy of Acthar during its approval of Acthar for the treatment of acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis and evaluated all other previous indications on the label through the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation ("DESI") process. In this process, the medical and scientific merits of the label and each indication on the label were evaluated based on publications, information from sponsors, and the judgment of the FDA. The label obtained after the DESI review and the addition of the multiple sclerosis indication is the Acthar label that was used until the most recent changes in 2010. That's something positive, but it's still 1970's science. However, the 10-K continues, saying (my emphasis added): In 2010, in connection with its review of a supplemental NDA for use of Acthar in treatment of infantile spasms, the FDA again reviewed evidence of safety and efficacy of Acthar, and added the IS indication to the label of approved indications while maintaining approval of Acthar for treatment of acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis and 17 other indications. In conjunction with its decision to retain these 19 indications on a modernized Acthar label, the FDA eliminated approximately 30 other indications from the label. The FDA review included a medical and scientific review of Acthar and each indication and an evaluation of available clinical and non-clinical literature as of the date of the review. The FDA did not require additional clinical trials for Acthar.
 Even though the FDA did not require additional clinical trials, the company did begin some in lupus and nephrotic syndrome. Recently, a formal trial in ALS was announced. Interested readers may wish to review the news item from this past November on the progress of the Phase 4 program of Acthar in lupus, which contains a link to the results of the pilot study that has been completed. Anyway, there is no generic and may well be no generic, just as there is and may well never be a generic for Premarin. Questcor and then Mallinckrodt have basically taken advantage of immense pricing flexibility for an old drug that has had a new lease on life. MNK has been marching through indications, increasing promotion for various niche, approved used of the drug. Despite all the allegations, the 10-K and latest 10-Q do not reflect legal peril from investigations of payoffs to doctors or anything like that. So, could Acthar justify MNK's share price? Let's look into the numbers and the true valuation of MNK. Acthar and MNK - Heavy leverage, but real economic profits MNK has transitioned and continues to transition from the high-margined business of fine chemicals and medical radiation products to the higher-margined business of specialty pharma. It's done this without an internal discovery engine. This growth by acquisition strategy can be done poorly, as in Valeant (NYSE:VRX), or intelligently, as with today's Allergan (NYSE:AGN). The balance sheet helps to tell the tale, as do GAAP results that account for the cost of the acquisitions, generally via amortization charges. The latest balance sheet from the earnings report as of the end of September has as some of its high points:     Shareholder equity $5.27 B Long-term debt $5.8 B Deferred income taxes $2.6 B Goodwill $3.7 B Intangible assets, net $9.2 B   So there are $3.7 + $9.2 - $5.8 B = -$7.6 B of tangible assets. Thus, the $4.9 B market cap of MNK at a closing price of $46.53 greatly understates the quantity of earnings MNK would need to have to A) earn back its tangible asset deficit (largely comprised of debt principal repayments and deferred income taxes) and B) earn back its market cap. Then, shareholders need a return on top of that.
 In the September quarter, which was Q4 at the time (but starting this year, the company will be on a calendar year), Acthar showed strong growth: Mallinckrodt plc    Select Product Line Net Sales (unaudited, in millions)                          Three Months Ended                 September 30,  2016   September 25,  2015   Percentchange   Currencyimpact   Constant-currencygrowth   Specialty Brands                     Acthar $ 327.0     $ 274.2     19.3 %   - %   19.3 %   Inomax 126.9     103.7     22.4     -     22.4     Ofirmev 75.6     61.4     23.1     -     23.1     Therakos immunotherapy 54.5     -     -     -     -     Hemostasis 17.2     -     -     -     -     Other 31.9     29.4     8.5     -     8.5     Specialty Brands Total $ 633.1     $ 468.7     35.1 %   That 19% revenue gain is impressive. The race is now on between cost-cutters at payors who are looking to minimize usage of Acthar and additional promotion of Acthar for a growing number of its numerous indications. In addition, MNK reported $240 MM of specialty generics revenues. Most of this comes from the highly profitable controlled substances space, where MNK has some special supply advantages. As far as the other specialty pharma products go, Inomax is a nitric acid drug-device product for respiratory distress in infants. Ofirmev is the unique IV acetaminophen (branded as Tylenol); this is growing in sales, but is also a target of efforts to use oral acetaminophen, not IV, wherever possible. The Q4 (September) 10-Q goes into great detail about certain complex patent matters regarding Inomax as well as Ofirmev (p. 25). I cannot opine about these matters, but they are material. Comments on EPS and tax rates Neither GAAP nor non-GAAP is a perfect measure of profitability. For example, here's what MNK tells you in the earnings report before reporting the earnings numbers. The last sentence is not very clear for non-financial types: Income tax benefit in the fourth quarter was $56.4 million versus $56.6 million, resulting in GAAP effective rates of negative 105.2% and 343.0%, respectively. The adjusted effective tax rate was 15.7% compared with 16.2%. The variance between the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate relates to the tax effect on pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and deferred tax benefits recognized upon pay down of intercompany installment notes created by internal sales of acquired intangible assets.
 Clearly, GAAP has some problems if effective tax rates are negative, especially to a triple-digit extent. Here is the brief discussion of GAAP versus non-GAAP numbers: Diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were $1.01 in the fourth quarter fiscal 2016 compared with $0.62 per diluted share. The increase principally reflects strong net sales and profit contribution in the Specialty Brands segment. These factors were partially offset by declines in the Specialty Generics segment and by higher interest expense. Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $2.04, up 21.4% from $1.68. There's a sort of contradiction in the above numbers. If GAAP diluted EPS was $1.01, but that was flattered significantly by a negative tax rate, then "real" GAAP earnings were lower than that. Yet the adjustment more than doubles them, to $2.04. How much is that? In the income statement, earnings before taxes were $53.6 MM; tax benefit was $56.4 MM. If the $53.6 MM had a 15% tax rate applied for this Irish company, then EPS would have been around $45 MM against 108.6 MM diluted shares. That might annualize to only around $1.70-ish per share. For a $45-50 stock, depending how it trades this week, that's not too attractive. The investor, or potential investor in my case and perhaps yours, then needs to ask whether the amortization charges are correct. Perhaps they are too onerous. Perhaps the Inomax and Ofirmev litigation and Acthar product life will go well, and the company will find ways to prolong their useful branded lives to be longer than expected in the amortization tables. Acthar has the look to me of a product that just might roll on for many years, given the difficulty of developing an AB-rated generic. So perhaps the truth lies between the GAAP and non-GAAP numbers, but as shown via balance sheet analysis, acquisition of the specialty products has entailed many billions of dollars of cash expenditures, and those have to hit the P&L statement at some point, as they hit the balance sheet promptly.
 Thus, overall, MNK is not really a cheap stock as some might think by looking at the P/E only. What are the prospects for Synacthen, and other threats, to cut into Acthar's sales? It's difficult to opine about Synacthen, because we cannot be sure if the FDA will grant it a broad label based on clinical trials on one or two indications. My guess is that whatever company acquires the rights to this product from MNK will work out an optimal strategy with the FDA that would give its product an optimal label. Perhaps showing noninferiority to Acthar in a clinical trial or two will allow the FDA to be generous to Synacthen. Perhaps the showing of something like bioequivalence in the extent and duration of steroids from the adrenals - if possible - will impress the FDA (this may not be achievable, though). Investors deal with this sort of uncertainty all the time. My take would be to seriously haircut my growth prospects for Acthar and make the company prove it can withstand what Synacthen may bode for this MNK mainstay. Further, the macro extent of Acthar's revenues begins to bring other competition. One way is to encourage pediatric neurologists to look more seriously at higher doses of steroid, such as prednisolone, in place of Acthar for seizures. Then there is Sabril (vigabatrin), which appears to be in line to go generic this April. Whether any company has filed for this and may be ready to go is not known to me; it is a small specialty product. In addition, one is led to wonder how difficult it would be to formulate a new brand that does what Acthar and Synacthen do. So, putting it all together, I see the risks to Acthar outweighing its benefits. The rest of MNK is difficult to analyze The company presented the rest of its revenue drivers and a summary of its pipeline at the J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM) Healthcare Conference in San Francisco in early January (see archived PDF). In addition to that, the company has a major dispute with the FDA about one of its generic products, methylphenidate ER (the brand is Ritalin/Ritalin LA).
 My quick and dirty take after looking at the remaining products and pipeline is that this can be viewed as a series of products, marketed and pipeline, for which MNK probably achieved no great bargain on purchase. Since this is a put-together agglomeration of products, with some mild synergy in hospital marketing for some currently marketed products, there's no special reason to look at this as other than likely to give a normal ROIC for the cost of the deals, and maybe less than that if one believes as I do that deal prices remain elevated. Summary and concluding remarks As documented, MNK is a member of a large class of pharmaceutical companies ranging in astuteness of execution from Allergan on the high end to Valeant on the low end and perhaps Endo (NASDAQ:ENDP) and Perrigo (NASDAQ:PRGO) not all that far above VRX and deal savvy that have grown by debt-fueled acquisition. Most of them, likely MNK included, have in my opinion expected something like the following metric: pay X% in interest cost for a brand, then raise the price X+3% (or something like that), thus making money. Then use marketing magic (or whatever), create some additive or even synergistic additional deals, et voila: a successful, growing company. Then repeat. Unfortunately, in the modern environment of deal prices, this is very different from a typical industrial or service company roll-up. There a company buys a small mom-and-pop enterprise for perhaps 4-6X earnings and instantly transmogrifies that by the magic of Wall Street into a 14-18X P/E. Add quality management, and the deal can make economic sense. But you have to buy right for the whole system to work. MNK therefore strikes me as a company that has done its best to make deals that could create value, but deflationary forces have come more to the fore in this industry that may be frustrating its attempt to build real shareholder value despite its best and well-intentioned efforts. Note that the company has had an investor call today. Likely there will be some informed commentary from analysts in the next day or two. I will update as necessary with an InstaBlog.
 Based on my knowledge both of the industry and the specifics of MNK's situation, I do not view this stock as attractive for new money. There are too many threats to Acthar over the next few years from different directions, including direct pressure on pricing from the Trump administration and other powerful forces. In addition to Synacthen, substitution of cheap steroids or generic Sabril for Acthar may slow its growth, and I would worry if I became an MNK shareholder every day that some credible company would announce that it has developed a more modern version of Acthar/Synacthen. Finally, much of MNK's generic business relates to narcotics. That's another risk factor, given the pressing need to deal with medical prescriptions for opioids. With the company engaged in litigation for its two other major products, I find more attractiveness in all the major biotechs and all the major Big Pharma companies. All these companies have discovery engines and none are as dependent on one product as is MNK. If I would want to own one roll-up, it would be AGN, but I remain neutral on that, with respect though for the quality of top management. Thus to answer the question in the title, I wouldn't buy the dip in MNK, and in a sense it is Valeant-lite, though solely because of the business model. MNK is clearly a higher-quality situation, though, with real economic profits and efforts to build a credible pipeline. I think it's worth watching, and I wish management well in contributing positively to human health with its product development. But overall, I think the true valuation of MNK is a bit rich relative to its peers. Thanks for reading and sharing any views you may have. (Submitted Tuesday AM with MNK at $48.23).

STAINES-UPON-THAMES, United Kingdom, Feb. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mallinckrodt plc (NYSE:   MNK), a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company, today reported results for the transition period from Oct. 1, 2016 to Dec. 30, 2016. The last quarter of calendar year 2016 was the planned transition period as the company aligns to a calendar-based financial year. The company will continue its "4/5/4" reporting convention with the first fiscal year ending Dec. 29, 2017 (referred to as "2017"). Unless otherwise noted, all comparisons of the transition period ended Dec. 30, 2016 are to the comparable period in fiscal 2016 ended Dec. 25, 2015.








Net sales were $829.9 million in the transition period, up 2.3%, or 2.6% on a constant-currency basis. GAAP gross profit was $445.8 million with gross profit as a percentage of net sales of 53.7%, compared with 55.6%. Adjusted gross profit was $623.9 million, compared with $638.7 million. Adjusted gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 75.2% versus 78.7%.
"Mallinckrodt's transition period results were solid, driven by predominantly volume-based growth in our diversified Specialty Brands segment, which continued to contribute greater than 70% of our total net sales. By focusing on execution, we are making good progress in building a leading specialty pharmaceutical company, creating near- and long-term value for patients with high unmet medical needs," said Mark Trudeau, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Our Acquire to Invest strategy is evident in our focus on portfolio transformation and in developing a robust, organic Specialty Brands pipeline, including investigational products like StrataGraft® skin substitute and Terlipressin - potentially transformative therapies that, if approved, may deliver significant, even life-changing benefits for patients."
"We have made significant progress over the past few months in strengthening our specialty pharmaceutical focus with the completed sale of our Nuclear Imaging business and our definitive agreement to divest the Intrathecal Therapy business. We believe these actions will provide additional capital for investment in continued growth and are confident this strategic transition will best position Mallinckrodt for the future," Trudeau said.
GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $368.3 million, compared with $223.3 million, representing 44.4% and 27.5% of net sales, respectively. SG&A in the transition period was impacted primarily by the settlement of the legacy Questcor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. matter brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and five states, and expenses associated with the termination of the company's defined benefit pension plans. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $217.2 million or 26.2% of net sales, compared with $208.9 million or 25.8%. Research and development (R&D) expense in the transition period increased 7.8%, with R&D as a percentage of net sales at 8.0% in the transition period, compared with 7.6%. Due to increased competitive entrants, declining volumes and channel consolidation, the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the quarter of $207.0 million associated with its Specialty Generics segment.
Income tax benefit was $121.7 million versus $37.3 million, resulting in GAAP effective rates of 40.8% and negative 56.1%, respectively. The adjusted effective tax rate was 15.7% in the transition period compared with 16.1%. The variance between the GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rate relates to the tax effect on pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and deferred tax benefits recognized upon pay down of intercompany installment notes created by internal sales of acquired intangible assets.
GAAP diluted per share results from continuing operations were a loss of $1.67 in the transition period compared with earnings per share of $0.89. The loss reflects the impact of a goodwill impairment charge in the Specialty Generics segment, the recently announced FTC settlement and expenses associated with termination of the company's defined benefit plans. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.91 versus $1.97.
BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
Specialty Brands SegmentNet sales for the Specialty Brands segment were $603.1 million in the transition period, compared with $543.2 million, an increase of 11.0%, or 11.6% on a constant-currency basis.
H.P. Acthar Gel net sales were $325.4 million in the transition period, a 13.5%2 increase over $286.7 million. Mallinckrodt's second largest product, INOMAX® (nitric oxide) gas, for inhalation, generated net sales of $118.3 million, up 6.8%2 over $110.8 million. OFIRMEV® (acetaminophen) injection net sales were $72.5 million compared with $66.9 million, an increase of 8.4%2.
Net sales of the Therakos® immunology platform were $47.4 million compared with $50.4 million, a decrease of 6.0%, with growth of 0.1% on a constant-currency basis. The company is encouraged by progress towards resolution of the third-party manufacturer production issue and expects resolution by the second quarter of 2017.
Specialty Generics SegmentNet sales in the transition period decreased 17.4% to $212.9 million, compared with $257.6 million, driven principally by net sales declines in various product categories due to continued competition and channel consolidation negatively impacting both price and volume. On a constant-currency basis, segment net sales declined 17.5%.
LIQUIDITYMallinckrodt generated $195.6 million in operating cash flow and $130.4 million in free cash flow in the transition period. During the transition period, operating cash flow and free cash flow were unfavorably impacted by tax payments to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 
During the period, the company repurchased 2.6 million ordinary shares for $158.8 million under its share repurchase program, bringing total shares repurchased since January 2015 under the company's authorized programs to 13.1 million, or approximately 11.3% of diluted shares outstanding, since inception.
Mallinckrodt's cash balance at the end of the transition period was $342.0 million, allowing the company to repay its revolving credit facility subsequent to the period close.
With its strong cash position, proven cash flow generation ability and proceeds from the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business, Mallinckrodt remains focused on capital allocation through business development and returning cash to shareholders.

Mallinckrodt uses its website as a channel of distribution of important company information, such as press releases, investor presentations and other financial information. It also uses its website to expedite public access to time-critical information regarding the company in advance of or in lieu of distributing a press release or a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosing the same information. Therefore, investors should look to the Investor Relations page of the website for important and time-critical information. Visitors to the website can also register to receive automatic e-mail and other notifications alerting them when new information is made available on the Investor Relations page of the website.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThis press release contains financial measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted gross profit, adjusted SG&A, net sales growth on a constant-currency basis, adjusted effective tax rate, and free cash flow, which are considered "non-GAAP" financial measures under applicable SEC rules and regulations.
Adjusted net income, adjusted gross profit and adjusted SG&A represent amounts prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) and adjusted for certain items that management believes are not reflective of the operational performance of the business. The adjustments for these items are on a pre-tax basis for adjusted gross profit and adjusted SG&A and on an after-tax basis for adjusted net income. Adjustments to GAAP amounts include, as applicable to each measure, restructuring and related charges, net; amortization and impairment charges; discontinued operations; acquisition-related expenses; changes in fair value of contingent consideration obligations; inventory step-up expenses; significant legal and environmental charges; pension settlement charges; recurrent cash tax payments to the IRS associated with internal installment sales transactions; and other items identified by the company. Adjusted diluted earnings per share represent adjusted net income divided by the number of diluted shares.
The adjusted effective tax rate is calculated as the income tax effects on continuing and discontinued operations plus the income tax impact included in Mallinckrodt's reconciliation of net income, divided by income from continuing and discontinued operations plus the pre-tax, non-income, tax-related adjustments included in its reconciliation of adjusted net income (excluding dilutive share impact). The income tax impact item included in its reconciliation of adjusted net income primarily represents the tax impact of adjustments between net income and adjusted net income as well as deferred tax benefits recognized upon pay down of intercompany installment notes created by internal sales of acquired intangible assets.
Net sales growth on a constant-currency basis measures the change in net sales between current- and prior-year periods using a constant currency, the exchange rate in effect during the applicable prior-year period.
Free cash flow for the transition quarter represents net cash provided by operating activities of $195.6 million less capital expenditures of $65.2 million, each as prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The company has provided these adjusted financial measures because they are used by management, along with financial measures in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the company's operating performance. In addition, the company believes that they will be used by certain investors to measure Mallinckrodt's operating results. Management believes that presenting these adjusted measures provides useful information about the company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. These adjusted measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company's definition of these adjusted measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.
Because adjusted financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of certain of these historical adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the tables accompanying this release.
Guidance on the company's 2017 diluted earnings per share and effective tax rate has been provided only on a non-GAAP basis. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of items that would be included in the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures. Because reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort, it is not included in this release.
Further information regarding non-GAAP financial measures can be found on the Investor Relations page of the company's website.

Acthar Gel; complex reporting and payment obligations under healthcare rebate programs; Mallinckrodt's ability to navigate price fluctuations; future changes to U.S. and foreign tax laws; Mallinckrodt's ability to achieve expected benefits from restructuring activities; complex manufacturing processes; competition; product liability losses and other litigation liability; ongoing governmental investigations; material health, safety and environmental liabilities; retention of key personnel; conducting business internationally; the effectiveness of information technology infrastructure; and cybersecurity and data leakage risks.

Scared of tech stocks? Health-care shares are cheaper — and rallying

Mallinckrodt gets special FDA status for experimental muscular dystrophy drug
Mallinckrodt PLC  shares rose in the extended session Wednesday after the drug maker said the Food and Drug Administration granted a special designation to one of its drugs intended to treat a rare form of muscular dystrophy. Mallinckrodt shares rose 1.8% to $44.90 after hours. The company said the FDA granted "orphan drug" status to its drug MNK-1411 for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD. If the drug is approved, the status would give Mallinckrodt seven years of marketing exclusivity for the treatment as well as other perks like tax credits and waiver of some regulatory fees. The treatment is expected to enter mid-stage clinical trials later this year. DMD is a genetic form of muscular dystrophy that mostly affects young boys, where a certain protein that holds muscle cells together is absent.

Mallinckrodt stock tumbles after new Citron Research report targets $40,000-a-vial drug

Jun. 5, 2017 at 2:36 p.m. ET
by Emma Court









Mallinckrodt stock drops 8% on new Citron Research report
Mallinckrodt PLC  shares dropped 8% in heavy morning trade Monday after short-seller Citron Research released a new report criticizing the pharmaceutical company. Citron Research has previously targeted the drugmaker, comparing it to Valeant  in a tweet in 2015. In the Monday report, the short-seller focused on Mallinckrodt's H.P. Acthar Gel, which can be used for a variety of diseases including multiple sclerosis, dermatological diseases and respiratory diseases. Massive price increases over the years have brought Acthar's price to nearly $40,000 a vial, and the product brings in more than $1 billion in revenue for Mallinckrodt. The report focused on recent remarks by Express Scripts  management as part of a conference call with Citi Research in which the company's Senior Vice President, Supply Chain and Specialty Everett Neville said "I think everybody in our company would agree that the product is vastly overpriced for the value." The Citron Research report claims that Mallinckrodt's Acthar relies on Express Scripts, which as a pharmacy-benefit manager middleman works to negotiate drug prices with drugmakers on behalf of health insurers and employers. "Express Scripts has FINALLY changed its stance on Acthar and the effect will send shares of Mallinckrodt to ZERO," the report claimed. "The words of Express Scripts management will echo through the halls of
Medicare and insurance companies as Acthar has finally met the truth:
it is an old drug that is way too expensive and not as good as its
competition." Citron Research has also previously targeted Express Scripts, comparing the company to Philidor Rx Services, the now-shuttered mail-order pharmacy which had its relationship with Valeant  come under scrutiny after criticism by Citron Research and others, including two news organizations. Mallinckrodt did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment. Shares have dropped 24.3% over the last three months, compared with a 2.3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Mallinckrodt's stock jumps after profit and sales beat
Shares of Mallinckrodt PLC  rallied 5.1% in premarket trade Monday, after the drug maker reported first-quarter results that beat expectations. Net income rose to $399.2 million, or $3.85 a share, from $118.3 million, or $1.06 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $1.68 beat the FactSet consensus of $1.64. Revenue slipped to $810.9 million from $815.8 million, but was bove the FactSet consensus of $784.8 million, helped by a stronger-than-expected performance in specialty generics. The company has now beat EPS expectations for 14-straight quarter, and sales expectations for six-straight quarters. The stock has shed 6.4% year to date through Friday, while the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF  has climbed 8.5% and the S&P 500  has gained 7.2%.

Scared of tech stocks? Health-care shares are cheaper — and rallying

Jul. 15, 2017 at 7:45 a.m. ET
by Philip van Doorn









Mallinckrodt gets special FDA status for experimental muscular dystrophy drug
Mallinckrodt PLC  shares rose in the extended session Wednesday after the drug maker said the Food and Drug Administration granted a special designation to one of its drugs intended to treat a rare form of muscular dystrophy. Mallinckrodt shares rose 1.8% to $44.90 after hours. The company said the FDA granted "orphan drug" status to its drug MNK-1411 for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, or DMD. If the drug is approved, the status would give Mallinckrodt seven years of marketing exclusivity for the treatment as well as other perks like tax credits and waiver of some regulatory fees. The treatment is expected to enter mid-stage clinical trials later this year. DMD is a genetic form of muscular dystrophy that mostly affects young boys, where a certain protein that holds muscle cells together is absent.

Mallinckrodt stock tumbles after new Citron Research report targets $40,000-a-vial drug

Jun. 5, 2017 at 2:36 p.m. ET
by Emma Court









Mallinckrodt stock drops 8% on new Citron Research report
Mallinckrodt PLC  shares dropped 8% in heavy morning trade Monday after short-seller Citron Research released a new report criticizing the pharmaceutical company. Citron Research has previously targeted the drugmaker, comparing it to Valeant  in a tweet in 2015. In the Monday report, the short-seller focused on Mallinckrodt's H.P. Acthar Gel, which can be used for a variety of diseases including multiple sclerosis, dermatological diseases and respiratory diseases. Massive price increases over the years have brought Acthar's price to nearly $40,000 a vial, and the product brings in more than $1 billion in revenue for Mallinckrodt. The report focused on recent remarks by Express Scripts  management as part of a conference call with Citi Research in which the company's Senior Vice President, Supply Chain and Specialty Everett Neville said "I think everybody in our company would agree that the product is vastly overpriced for the value." The Citron Research report claims that Mallinckrodt's Acthar relies on Express Scripts, which as a pharmacy-benefit manager middleman works to negotiate drug prices with drugmakers on behalf of health insurers and employers. "Express Scripts has FINALLY changed its stance on Acthar and the effect will send shares of Mallinckrodt to ZERO," the report claimed. "The words of Express Scripts management will echo through the halls of
Medicare and insurance companies as Acthar has finally met the truth:
it is an old drug that is way too expensive and not as good as its
competition." Citron Research has also previously targeted Express Scripts, comparing the company to Philidor Rx Services, the now-shuttered mail-order pharmacy which had its relationship with Valeant  come under scrutiny after criticism by Citron Research and others, including two news organizations. Mallinckrodt did not immediately respond to MarketWatch's request for comment. Shares have dropped 24.3% over the last three months, compared with a 2.3% rise in the S&P 500 .

Mallinckrodt's stock jumps after profit and sales beat
Shares of Mallinckrodt PLC  rallied 5.1% in premarket trade Monday, after the drug maker reported first-quarter results that beat expectations. Net income rose to $399.2 million, or $3.85 a share, from $118.3 million, or $1.06 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $1.68 beat the FactSet consensus of $1.64. Revenue slipped to $810.9 million from $815.8 million, but was bove the FactSet consensus of $784.8 million, helped by a stronger-than-expected performance in specialty generics. The company has now beat EPS expectations for 14-straight quarter, and sales expectations for six-straight quarters. The stock has shed 6.4% year to date through Friday, while the SPDR S&P Pharmaceuticals ETF  has climbed 8.5% and the S&P 500  has gained 7.2%.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1867, the Mallinckrodt brothers, Gustav, Otto and Edward, founded G. Mallinckrodt & Co. in St. Louis, Missouri.[4] The Mallinckrodt family had immigrated from Germany, and Otto and Edward both returned to Germany, the leader in chemistry at the time, for advanced training.[5] Mallinckrodt Chemical Works was incorporated 15 years later. By 1898, the company had established itself as a pharmaceuticals supplier and in 1913 became the first to introduce barium sulfate as a contrast medium for x-rays.[4]
In part due to early success in production of radiology agents, and at the behest of surgeon Evarts Graham, Edward Mallinckrodt Sr. assigned one of the company's top chemists to collaborate in developing the first radiographic agent for gallbladder and bile duct imaging.[6] A posthumous endowment by Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. on behalf of his father to the Washington University medical school radiology department resulted in the creation of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology.[7]
Nuclear waste in St. Louis, Missouri[edit]
Henry Farr and John Ruhoff, technical managers for Mallinckrodt, Inc. were directed by Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. to develop a chemical process for purifying large quantities of uranium.[8] Uranium purified by Mallinckrodt was used at the University of Chicago Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear chain reaction. Mallinckrodt also contributed uranium to the Manhattan Project, producing fissionable materials used in the atomic weapons detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From 1942 to 1957 Mallinckrodt purified 50,000 short tons (45,000,000 kg) of uranium products at various locations in and around the city of St. Louis.[9] The waste was secretly dumped on Coldwater Creek and in various St. Louis suburbs, including Berkeley, Hazelwood, Bridgeton, and Weldon Spring with the approval of the federal government, which is now[when?] taking financial responsibility for the cleanup.[10] The dumping substantially contaminated Coldwater Creek.
Cleanup efforts are now[when?] underway by the Army Corps of Engineers.[11] Cleanup sites include the St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS), where uranium was refined; the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS), where waste produced at SLDS was stored; the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), where waste from SLAPS was relocated; and the St. Louis Airport Site Vicinity Properties (SLAPS VPs), areas where contamination was caused by relocation of waste. Additional nuclear waste was also deposited at the West Lake Landfill, which has now[when?] been designated a Superfund site. Various buildings have been decontaminated and demolished and nuclear material has been excavated and shipped out of St. Louis by covered rail as part of the cleanup process, yet more nuclear waste remains in and around St. Louis.

Market[edit]
Mallinckrodt markets its products to major wholesalers and retail drug store chains. Imaging products are marketed primarily to physicians, technologists and hospitals, imaging centers, cardiology clinics and radiopharmacies.[3]
Products[edit]
Mallinckrodt has two main product lines.[28]

Specialty Pharmaceuticals products include branded drugs as well as specialty generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Products include biologics, medicinal opioids, synthetic controlled substances, and acetominophen.
Medical Imaging products include contrast media and radiopharmaceuticals for medical imaging applications.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, Specialty Pharmaceuticals accounted for 74% of net sales. Key specialty pharmaceutical products include[28]

Acthar gel, an injectable biopharmaceutical used for the treatment of infantile spasms, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, and certain orphan diseases. Mallinckrodt acquired this product via its acquisition of Questcor Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[29] When Questcor acquired the drug in 2001 it sold for $40 a vial; within a year of the acquisition Questcor raised the price of the drug to $1,500 per vial and to $28,000 by 2013.[30] In 2013, Questcor acquired the US rights to a competing product, Synacthen Depot, from Novartis.[30] In 2014 Mallinckrodt raised the price of Acthar further to $34,000.[31] The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general from five states sued Mallinckrodt for anti-competitive behavior with regard to the acquisition of Synacthen Depot and the monopolistic pricing of Acthar, and in January 2017 the company settled, agreeing to pay $100 million and to license Synacthen Depot to a competitor.[29]
Offirmev is a proprietary IV formulation of acetominophen used in conjunction with opioid painkillers in the post surgical setting.
Xartemis XR is a controlled release oral combination of acetominophen and oxycodone for the treatment of acute pain.
Exalgo is a once-daily, long-acting form of hydromorphone, another pain drug.

Key generic specialty products include:[28]

Hydrocodone API and tablets
Oxycodone API and tablets
Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release tablets
Dextroamphetamine sulfate controlled release tablets
Other controlled substances, including acetominophen-containing products

Medical Imaging products include Optiray (ioversol injection), an iodide based contrast medium for CT scans, and Optimark (gadoversetamide injection) a Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent used in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain or liver.
As of 1988, Mallinckrodt was the only company in the US that is allowed to receive cocaine, which it has used to make cocaine hydrochloride, a prescription drug used in hospitals as a local anesthetic by eye and ear, nose and throat doctors.[13]

Red Flags: Pharmacists Anti-Abuse Video



          26,780 views
        

            3 years ago
          



          The National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) and the Anti-Diversion Industry Working Group (ADIWG), a consortium of pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors, has created this educational video for pharmacists to help them identify the warning signs of prescription drug abuse and diversion when dispensing controlled substance prescriptions.The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and various state pharmacy boards describe red flags as circumstances that should raise reasonable suspicion about the validity of a controlled substance prescription. The video highlights a number of these potential warning signs, some which are not easy to spot, by weaving personal narratives with interactions between pharmacists and customers.Red Flags is sponsored by six ADIWG member companies - the group's founder, Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, along with members, Cardinal Health, McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen, Actavis and Endo-Qualitest Pharmaceuticals - as part of the group's commitment to reduce prescription drug diversion and abuse. This is the first educational tool produced by the ADIWG as it continues its collaborative effort to help combat America's fastest growing drug problem.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
In 1867, the Mallinckrodt brothers, Gustav, Otto and Edward, founded G. Mallinckrodt & Co. in St. Louis, Missouri.[4] The Mallinckrodt family had immigrated from Germany, and Otto and Edward both returned to Germany, the leader in chemistry at the time, for advanced training.[5] Mallinckrodt Chemical Works was incorporated 15 years later. By 1898, the company had established itself as a pharmaceuticals supplier and in 1913 became the first to introduce barium sulfate as a contrast medium for x-rays.[4]
In part due to early success in production of radiology agents, and at the behest of surgeon Evarts Graham, Edward Mallinckrodt Sr. assigned one of the company's top chemists to collaborate in developing the first radiographic agent for gallbladder and bile duct imaging.[6] A posthumous endowment by Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. on behalf of his father to the Washington University medical school radiology department resulted in the creation of the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology.[7]
Nuclear waste in St. Louis, Missouri[edit]
Henry Farr and John Ruhoff, technical managers for Mallinckrodt, Inc. were directed by Edward Mallinckrodt, Jr. to develop a chemical process for purifying large quantities of uranium.[8] Uranium purified by Mallinckrodt was used at the University of Chicago Chicago Pile-1, the first nuclear chain reaction. Mallinckrodt also contributed uranium to the Manhattan Project, producing fissionable materials used in the atomic weapons detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. From 1942 to 1957 Mallinckrodt purified 50,000 short tons (45,000,000 kg) of uranium products at various locations in and around the city of St. Louis.[9] The waste was secretly dumped on Coldwater Creek and in various St. Louis suburbs, including Berkeley, Hazelwood, Bridgeton, and Weldon Spring with the approval of the federal government, which is now[when?] taking financial responsibility for the cleanup.[10] The dumping substantially contaminated Coldwater Creek.
Cleanup efforts are now[when?] underway by the Army Corps of Engineers.[11] Cleanup sites include the St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS), where uranium was refined; the St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS), where waste produced at SLDS was stored; the Hazelwood Interim Storage Site (HISS), where waste from SLAPS was relocated; and the St. Louis Airport Site Vicinity Properties (SLAPS VPs), areas where contamination was caused by relocation of waste. Additional nuclear waste was also deposited at the West Lake Landfill, which has now[when?] been designated a Superfund site. Various buildings have been decontaminated and demolished and nuclear material has been excavated and shipped out of St. Louis by covered rail as part of the cleanup process, yet more nuclear waste remains in and around St. Louis.

Market[edit]
Mallinckrodt markets its products to major wholesalers and retail drug store chains. Imaging products are marketed primarily to physicians, technologists and hospitals, imaging centers, cardiology clinics and radiopharmacies.[3]
Products[edit]
Mallinckrodt has two main product lines.[28]

Specialty Pharmaceuticals products include branded drugs as well as specialty generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). Products include biologics, medicinal opioids, synthetic controlled substances, and acetominophen.
Medical Imaging products include contrast media and radiopharmaceuticals for medical imaging applications.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, Specialty Pharmaceuticals accounted for 74% of net sales. Key specialty pharmaceutical products include[28]

Acthar gel, an injectable biopharmaceutical used for the treatment of infantile spasms, acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, and certain orphan diseases. Mallinckrodt acquired this product via its acquisition of Questcor Pharmaceuticals in 2014.[29] When Questcor acquired the drug in 2001 it sold for $40 a vial; within a year of the acquisition Questcor raised the price of the drug to $1,500 per vial and to $28,000 by 2013.[30] In 2013, Questcor acquired the US rights to a competing product, Synacthen Depot, from Novartis.[30] In 2014 Mallinckrodt raised the price of Acthar further to $34,000.[31] The Federal Trade Commission and attorneys general from five states sued Mallinckrodt for anti-competitive behavior with regard to the acquisition of Synacthen Depot and the monopolistic pricing of Acthar, and in January 2017 the company settled, agreeing to pay $100 million and to license Synacthen Depot to a competitor.[29]
Offirmev is a proprietary IV formulation of acetominophen used in conjunction with opioid painkillers in the post surgical setting.
Xartemis XR is a controlled release oral combination of acetominophen and oxycodone for the treatment of acute pain.
Exalgo is a once-daily, long-acting form of hydromorphone, another pain drug.

Key generic specialty products include:[28]

Hydrocodone API and tablets
Oxycodone API and tablets
Methylphenidate hydrochloride extended release tablets
Dextroamphetamine sulfate controlled release tablets
Other controlled substances, including acetominophen-containing products

Medical Imaging products include Optiray (ioversol injection), an iodide based contrast medium for CT scans, and Optimark (gadoversetamide injection) a Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent used in magnetic resonance imaging of the brain or liver.
As of 1988, Mallinckrodt was the only company in the US that is allowed to receive cocaine, which it has used to make cocaine hydrochloride, a prescription drug used in hospitals as a local anesthetic by eye and ear, nose and throat doctors.[13]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
