Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

The False Promise of the Prosperity Gospel: Why I Called Out Joel Osteen and Joyce Meyer






By Pastor Rick Henderson

33k






















I have been preaching for 20 years.  Yesterday I did something that I have never done before in a sermon.  I publicly called out false teachers and named them by name.  I said:

If you listen to Joel Osteen and Joyce Meyer, if you take what they teach seriously, it will not be good for you.  It will be detrimental to your long-term growth as a follower of Jesus.
(You can watch my sermon here.)
I used to think that their error was so blatantly obvious that they could just be ignored.  I was wrong.  They are massively growing in popularity in the evangelical world and are seen as credible and helpful.  Before I'm inundated with questioning emails I want to share why I distrust these two and think you should as well.  So, don't shoot me -- at least not yet.
When I was a kid I could tell the difference between neighborhood kids who wanted to be my friend from the neighborhood kids who were my friends so that they could play with my toys.  Joel and Joyce are the latter.  They both teach a twisted form of Christianity that teaches obedience, giving and faith as a way to get things from God.  They are both products of what is known as the Prosperity Gospel and The Word of Faith Movement, or the Seed Faith Movement.
Dangers of the Prosperity Gospel
John Piper does a great job of defining what the Prosperity Gospel is and why it is so sinister.  Please take a few minutes to watch this before moving on the critiques of Joyce Meyer and Joel Osteen:


Joyce Meyer
When I first heard her tell her story I was deeply moved and impressed.  She is an amazing example of overcoming hurts and abuse.  She will forever have my admiration and respect in that regard.  Furthermore, she gives spectacular advice.  If my wife or if one of my daughters went to her in a moment of crisis, I believe they would return with magnificently helpful advice.  If they went to her for teaching, they would return with deadly heresy.
False Doctrine
1.  She teaches that Jesus literally stopped being the Son of God on the Cross (listen here):

"He could have helped himself up until the point where he said I commend my spirit into your hands, at that point he couldn't do nothing for himself anymore. He had become sin, he was no longer the Son of God. He was sin."
2.  She teaches that Jesus went to Hell and became the first-born again man (listen here):

"Do you know something? The minute that blood sacrifice was accepted Jesus was the first human being that was ever born again. Now that was real it happened when he was in hell."
3.  She teaches that Jesus paid for our sins in Hell:

"There is no hope of anyone going to heaven unless they believe this truth I am presenting. You cannot go to heaven unless you believe with all your heart that Jesus took your place in hell"  -From The Most Important Decision You Will Ever Make
4.  She teaches that words have power and you can release the power of Heaven through your words. 
5.  She teaches that you need special revelation from God to understand what she teaches because it is NOT contained in the Bible (listen here):

"The Bible can't even find any way to explain this. Not really. That's why you've got to get it by revelation. There are no words to explain what I'm telling you. I've got to just trust God that He's putting it into your spirit like He put it into mine."  From "What Happened From the Cross to The Throne"

"Now spirits don't have bodies, so we can't see them. Okay? There probably is, I believe there is, and I certainly hope there is several angels up here this morning that are preaching with me. I believe that right before I speak some anointed statement to you, that one of them bends over and says in my ear what I'm supposed to say to you."  From "Witchcraft & Related Spirits" (Part 1) - 2 A-27 Audiotape)
6.  She teaches that she is no longer a sinner.
Unfortunately I could continue with examples of her utter misuse of scripture, false teaching and blatant heresy.  In America, Christians have an embarrassment of riches.  We can buy more books, download more podcasts and tune into more helpful teachers than anyone else on the planet.  The lies that she teaches are easily lost in the hum of all the great teachers we hear.  But this is not the case in the third world.
In many other countries their resources are far fewer. Uneducated pastors, who are doing their very best and uninformed Christians have this garbage pumped into their countries through radio waves and TV broadcasts. Because Joyce Meyer is endorsed here, she is trusted there.  And, she can afford to spread her message with the money she makes from American Christians who buy her books, CDs and who attend her conferences.  Her influence is severely disrupting the church in the third world.  Her teachings are the unfortunate starting point for Christians in the third world and it is birthing even greater heresies.
The devastating reality that we have to come to grips with is that when we support her here, we support the churches she is undoing there.
Financial Concerns
There is nothing wrong with being wealthy. I love it when Christians are rich.  That should mean more money to fund the mission.  But there is a line to how much money we as leaders should spend on ourselves. I don't know where the line is, but it is somewhere before the ministry purchasing million dollar homes for us and our kids.  That line is somewhere before purchasing us a $10 million private jet. The line is somewhere before the ministry spending $261, 498 for 68 pieces of furniture.  That equates to $3,845.56 per item.  That line is somewhere before spending so egregiously that the U.S. Senate investigates us.  Joyce Meyer lands on the other side of that line.
The following link includes audio from Joyce Meyer.  Around 5:30 she is asked if people will get more money back to them if they give financially to her ministry.
Not only does she teach giving as a way to leverage more money from God, she is reckless with desperate people.  She is not at all concerned if people give to her instead of paying bills.  This is intolerable!
Questionable Example and Lack of Accountability
I challenge you to watch a typical message by Joyce Meyer.  Here are a few of things you will notice:
She pauses about every five minutes for applause.  And if people don't applaud she is likely to say something like, "I'm preaching better than you're acting."
She talks about herself constantly.  She is the main character in every story she tells.  Even when she talks about herself in a self-deprecating way, some how it comes across in a way that causes people to admire her more.
God talks to her and reveals new information to her... a lot!
Her ministry lacks real accountability.  Her family and her close friends are the governing board.  This is an organization that receives almost $100 million dollars annually, and with no substantive accountability.
Conclusion for Joyce Meyer
What I wrote and linked in the first section should have been enough to completely remove her from our sphere of trust.  Her doctrine is horrific.  Her hermeneutics are horrible.  She is a woman who seems to have an unrestrained love for money and applause.  Her finances are questionable at best.  Her example is questionable at best.  Her impact on desperate people here, as well as churches and pastors around the globe is wildly destructive.
I lament with you a sense of loss if she was a teacher you trusted.  I lament that someone who is so wrong has so much influence with so many. I do not regret, however, pointing to her as a false teacher and as one who should be rejected.
Joel Osteen
Like Joyce Meyer, Joel Osteen has some really great things to say.  He is encouraging and the man is certainly happy.  This should not be held against him.
The man is confused on theology.  He has much of the same doctrinal misunderstandings as does Joyce Meyer.  They come from the same tradition.  His doctrine is difficult to discern for many because he won't talk about doctrine.  He won't talk about theology.  He quickly back pedals when asked hard questions, as seen here in an interview with Larry King.
In fairness, Joel published a letter of apology after this interview.
While I commend him for his humility and courage to publicly declare that he was wrong, this is just one of too many instances. He frequently misunderstands important matters of faith and doctrine when being interviewed. He repeatedly gets the Gospel wrong.  And he does so when talking to millions.
If we take Joel at his word, our only conclusion is that he is either incapable or unwilling to understand and explain how the Gospel intersects with all of life.
We recently hosted Hank Hanegraaff (The Bible Answerman) at SMCC. He has some very helpful insights (here and here) into Joel Osteen's confused views of faith, doctrine and Scripture:
Joel Osteen and Prosperity Gospel
The Prosperity Gospel is much like all other religions in that it uses faith, it uses doing good things to leverage material blessings from God.  Essentially, use God to get things from God.

"God has already done everything He's going to do. The ball is now in your court. If you want success, if you want wisdom, if you want to be prosperous and healthy, you're going to have to do more than meditate and believe; you must boldly declare words of faith and victory over yourself and your family" From Your Best Life Now, p.132

"If you are believing for your child to find God, go help somebody else's child to develop a relationship with God. If you're struggling financially, go out and help somebody who has less than you have ... f you want to reap financial blessings, you must sow financial seeds in the lives of others ... If you want to see healing and restoration come to your life, go out and help somebody else get well" From Your Best Life Now, pp. 224, 250-51
This is not the Gospel.  This is a false Gospel.  Joel teaches that we open ourselves to God to get more from God.  He teaches that we use our words to speak into existence a better reality.  This straight from the Word of Faith Movement.  This is not what is taught throughout the New Testament.  Consider what the Apostle Paul wrote.  And remember that he wrote this while in prison.
Philippians 4:10-13 I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. I am not saying this because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength.
Conclusion
When I was in seminary, Heather and I were poor.  There were seasons in which I worked 70+ hours a week while taking a full-time Master's load.  There were times that I had to sleep every other day so that I could get all my work done.  This was an extended period of exhausting financial stress.
During this time, I remember reading something from Joel Osteen.  He and his wife claimed by faith a new house that they wanted.  Joel was unsure, but his wife Victoria was confident.  And she lovingly chastised him for his lack of faith.  Sometime later, they purchased that house.  Still in seminary, my wife and I were walking through our dream neighborhood and that was playing through my mind.  As I walked through the neighborhood, looking at all the homes, I wanted so badly for what Joel is teaching to be true.  I don't know if you can understand how desperately I wanted it to be true.
I wanted relief and I wanted more.  But I knew that it wasn't true.  I knew that my exhaustion and desperation made me emotionally vulnerable to this false Gospel.  I'm educated and well read.  I've haven't just read the Bible, I've translated large chunks of it from the original Hebrew and Greek.  I think I understand it.  I think I have a relatively significant level of discernment.  But for a moment, I was emotionally vulnerable to this false doctrine.
What about the millions of others who are desperate, searching, hoping and vulnerable without the discernment?  We owe it to them to not tolerate a false gospel any longer.
If you made it to the end of this blog post, congratulations.  This is a thick and heavy subject.  Even though I've written much, this only begins to scratch the surface of the repugnant nature of the Prosperity Gospel.

In Memoriam: Joel Meyer of Meyer Sales

May 5, 2016Staff EditorNews, People 



Lighting industry veteran Joel Meyer of Meyer Sales in Florida passed away unexpectedly. He was an independent sales representative for Artcraft, among other lines. Our condolences to the Meyer family. 
“Joel was our representative, colleague, and friend for over 30 years. In addition to his sales function, he stocked our products locally and served on the Artcraft Sales Council and Product Council. We could always count on Joel for his honesty, integrity, and plain old common sense,” says Howard Bernstein of Artcraft. “Joel was very well respected and liked and will be sorely missed. This is a very big loss for all of us,” he adds. 
Noting that Meyer spent his entire career in the lighting business, showroom owner Ric Jolie of Benson’s Lighting & Fans in Miami calls Joel, “one of the good guys” in lighting, adding, “His work ethic, integrity, humor and friendship will be sadly missed.”
A service in celebration of Joel’s life will be held Friday at 10:00 AM at Star of David synagogue in Tamarac.

 Joel Meyer  President & CEO
GETAPP.COM: Who are you are and what is your role in the company?
MEYER: President & CEO.
GETAPP.COM: Can you briefly present your management team?
MEYER: Joel Meyer, President, and Travis Prowell, VP of Engineering, lead ASA. Joel handles the strategic direction of the company and general financial and management issues. Joel holds a Bachelor's degree from Valparaiso University and an MBA from the University of Chicago. Travis handles product development and engineering for ASA. Travis holds a Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley. He has a long history of developing innovative online solutions for companies like Esurance, Oacis Healthcare, and Microsoft.
GETAPP.COM: Are you a cloud or a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company?
MEYER: We offer a software-as-a-service product called ASAP yet at the same time offer cloud services to the clients using some of our legacy products.
GETAPP.COM: How do you use and promote usage of cloud computing?
MEYER: ASA has been making use of cloud computing for many years. Starting out by hosting many of its clients on its own servers, ASA built the next generation of ASAP to take full advantage of cloud computing, including using the flexibility of adding computing power as needed during peak registration times while cutting back on power and usage when registrations are slowest. Cloud computing also gives ASA the ability to maintain backups of the vital data it stores on behalf of clients in several locations, greatly minimizing the risk of a natural or man-made disaster impacting its operations.
GETAPP.COM: What are the points of difference of your solutions?
MEYER: The customization of ASAP and ability to change the visual nature and appearance of the program to fit into a client's website is important to maintain a client's brand and image. Our pricing model is based on a pay-as-you-go approach where ASA earns revenue by the transaction, not the number of classes signed up for or the cost of the class. Whether the class/event is $25 or $2000 and whether the patron signs up for one or an entire family at a time, we charge the same transaction fee. We also have real-time reporting and data analysis available to our clients and our clients can make real-time updates to the online registration site.
GETAPP.COM: How would you like to be evaluated by a prospect?
MEYER: ASA stresses to new clients to pay particular attention to the ease-of-use of ASAP, the customization clients can use to brand their registration site and make it visually appealing, and the customer support offered to assist in both implementation and ongoing use of ASAP. We also highlight what we call our Power-to-Price ratio; ASAP is the most powerful option in our price range.
GETAPP.COM: Why do your customers buy from you?
MEYER: Our reputation for service and willingness to work with clients to get ASAP. Our service team is US-based and answer the phone directly versus using a call-center approach. ASA adds many enhancements to ASAP as a direct result of feedback and recommendations from its clients.
GETAPP.COM: Can you mention some of your key clients?
MEYER: Key clients include park & recreation clients in both affluent and lower income areas, large universities' special programs departments and many public and private agencies.
GETAPP.COM: What do you see as the key trend emerging in the industry?
MEYER: We see two main trends that are related to each other. First, our clients realize the need to get their operations online, but they are just beginning to understand and demand the additional tools that allow them maximize their efforts. Examples include tools such as surveys, online class content management and teacher-student interaction. Second, those same clients are also moving from having a simple website with basic class listings to spending the time and money to create attractive and visually appealing websites. ASAP is a great resource for these clients on both regards as our customization allows them to carry the new look and feel from their website into our ASAP product using our SiteWrap  and our class management options help the office staff and teacher make the most of the tools available to them.
GETAPP.COM: What is THE most important message you feel you should get across to someone considering buying your solutions?
MEYER: There is not a more powerful, affordable, class management and registration solution on the market.
GETAPP.COM: Thanks for your time, Joel.

Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.
