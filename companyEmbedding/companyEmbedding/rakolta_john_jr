John Rakolta


Personal details


Born
1947 (age 69–70)


Political party
Republican


Alma mater
Marquette University
Harvard University


John Rakolta Jr. is the CEO of Walbridge[1] (formerly known as Walbridge Aldinger). He was also one of the National Finance Chairs for Mitt Romney's 2008 Presidential Campaign. Rakolta's wife Terry Rakolta is the sister of Mitt's former sister-in-law, Ronna Romney.
He was offered the opportunity to be part of a consortium of five Detroit-area businessmen to provide a loan to Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to convince him to resign so that the scandals he had created would end, but Rakolta declined before it actually happened, so the other four went on with it alone.
Rakolta received his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Marquette University in 1970 and then studied smaller company management at the Harvard Business School.[2]
All four of Rakolta's grandparents were immigrants from Romania.[3][4] He is the Honorary-Consul General [5] for Romania in Detroit.
Rakolta's father, John Rakolta, Sr. (1923–2003), was the head of Walbridge Aldinger before Rakolta. Rakolta Jr. began his career at Walbridge in 1971, became COO in 1978 and CEO in 1991. Rakolta is also on the board of the Munder Funds since 1993.[citation needed]
Aside from his work for the Romney campaign in 2008, Rakolta was a major fundraiser for the Bush campaign in 2004.[6] Most recently he was State Finance Chair for Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan. Rakolta served as the chairman of New Detroit from 2003-10.[citation needed]
Rakolta's daughter Lauren Rakolta was also a major figure in Mitt Romney's campaign and previously had worked for Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts. She was the finance director for Republican Rick Snyder's campaign for governor of Michigan in 2010.[7]
In 2015, Rakolta supported the Marco Rubio presidential campaign, 2016.[8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

John Rakolta III
 


The son of a major local construction executive has been promoted to executive vice president and chief administrative officer of Walbridge.
John Rakolta III, son of John Rakolta Jr., chairman and CEO of Walbridge Aldinger Co., replaces Vince DeAngelis in that position. Most recently, Rakolta III was group vice president and CFO.
It's one of several executive hiring and promotions moves for the Detroit-based construction company.
"We believe that our leadership team is in place to launch the company into its next hundred years and will reinforce the essential cultural, character and sacrifices created by our founders and underscore their importance for our next generation of employees," Rakolta Jr. said in a news release.
According to the release, DeAngelis is retiring and "will divide his time between work in the nonprofit arena, caring for an extended family member, as well as continuing to consult with Walbridge."
Rakolta III's LinkedIn profile says he attended Harvard Business School, New York University and Purdue University and has been CFO since July 2007.
He is being replaced by William McCulloch, who joins Walbridge from FSE Energy Inc., a New Orleans-area contractor in the wood products, oil and gas, petrochemical, power, chemical, textile, food and plastics industries.
McCulloch's LinkedIn page says he attended the University of New Orleans and the University of Alabama.
In addition, Peter Darga, who has been with Walbridge for 23 years, has been promoted to company vice president and treasurer. He will have oversight of accounting and treasury functions, according to a news release.

John Rakolta


Personal details


Born
1947 (age 69–70)


Political party
Republican


Alma mater
Marquette University
Harvard University


John Rakolta Jr. is the CEO of Walbridge[1] (formerly known as Walbridge Aldinger). He was also one of the National Finance Chairs for Mitt Romney's 2008 Presidential Campaign. Rakolta's wife Terry Rakolta is the sister of Mitt's former sister-in-law, Ronna Romney.
He was offered the opportunity to be part of a consortium of five Detroit-area businessmen to provide a loan to Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick to convince him to resign so that the scandals he had created would end, but Rakolta declined before it actually happened, so the other four went on with it alone.
Rakolta received his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Marquette University in 1970 and then studied smaller company management at the Harvard Business School.[2]
All four of Rakolta's grandparents were immigrants from Romania.[3][4] He is the Honorary-Consul General [5] for Romania in Detroit.
Rakolta's father, John Rakolta, Sr. (1923–2003), was the head of Walbridge Aldinger before Rakolta. Rakolta Jr. began his career at Walbridge in 1971, became COO in 1978 and CEO in 1991. Rakolta is also on the board of the Munder Funds since 1993.[citation needed]
Aside from his work for the Romney campaign in 2008, Rakolta was a major fundraiser for the Bush campaign in 2004.[6] Most recently he was State Finance Chair for Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan. Rakolta served as the chairman of New Detroit from 2003-10.[citation needed]
Rakolta's daughter Lauren Rakolta was also a major figure in Mitt Romney's campaign and previously had worked for Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts. She was the finance director for Republican Rick Snyder's campaign for governor of Michigan in 2010.[7]
In 2015, Rakolta supported the Marco Rubio presidential campaign, 2016.[8]

            COMMENTEMAILMOREThe Detroit-based Walbridge construction firm in 1982 built a big addition to Chrysler's plant in Kokomo, Ind., which produced transmissions for the automaker's important new K cars. But cash-strapped Chrysler found it lacked the money to pay Walbridge for the work."Chrysler couldn't pay us our final bill on that project," recalled John Rakolta Jr., CEO of Walbridge today. "And they said, 'Would you take product in return for your final bill?' And my father agreed that the final bill would be paid in K cars as opposed to cash. We took 50 K cars. They were worth about $15,000 each. So we all drove K cars for four or five years.”It was a key moment in the history of Walbridge, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year. Just a few years later, in 1986, Chrysler built its enormous technology center in Auburn Hills and awarded the contract, worth more than $1 billion, to Walbridge. Thanks to the K car deal, Chrysler CEO Lee Iacocca viewed Walbridge as not just a contractor but as a strategic partner.DETROIT FREE PRESSRedeveloping Detroit remains long, hard slog"When we were selected to be the contractor for the Chrysler Technology Center, Mr. Iacocca made a point of telling us that ‘You won the project fair and square, but that put the icing on the cake.' "There have been many such dramatic moments in the history of Walbridge, which formed in 1916 as Walbridge Aldinger, a partnership between building expert George Walbridge and financial expert Albert Aldinger.Now simply Walbridge, the firm has built dozens of iconic structures in its hometown of Detroit, including the Penobscot Building, Book Tower, Orchestra Hall, the Detroit People Mover, One Detroit Center and Compuware headquarters.Most identified for its automotive work, Walbridge work included Ford's Rouge plant in the late 1920s and again in this century, General Motors' wind tunnel at its Warren Tech Center in the 1970s and Visteon's headquarters campus in Van Buren Township in 2004. The company now employs about 1,000 workers and does more than $1 billion a year in revenue.Walbridge survived the Great Depression doing work for Maxwell Motor Car by doing maintenance on railroad lines and other work it could pick up. Once World War II began, Walbridge turned to defense projects, building vast munitions factories for the government in Missouri and Minnesota, factories that produced billions of rounds of ammunition. (Photo: Walbridge)But the company's greatest crisis came after the war, when founders Walbridge and Aldinger died, leaving an ownership conundrum for the pair's several other partners who owned pieces of the firm. The firm survived the crisis because of a culture that valued service and continuity."Each time somebody sold to the succeeding group, they left a little on the table for the next guy," Rakolta said. "They didn’t extract every single last dollar in value that the company might have been worth. They sold at a discount so there was protection for the next guy. So in case the economy went down or they had a couple job losses, they wouldn’t be stretched to the limit."Just prior to the Chrysler Tech Center contract, the firm acquired its largest competitor at the time, a company called Darin and Armstrong, and added 250 employees to its own 80. That provided more expertise and personnel, enabling the firm to go after bigger jobs and to take more risks. "You have to have a big appetite for risk to be in this business," Rakolta said.Today, the firm employs about 1,000 staffers and works throughout the U.S. and in several other countries. Reported annual revenues top $1 billion. The firm is headquartered in the One Kennedy Square building near Campus Martius in downtown Detroit.The Rakolta family has long been involved in the firm as principal owners and executives going back more than 50 years. CEO Rakolta started working at the firm as a youthful intern in the 1950s. His son, John Rakolta III, serves as chief financial officer today and is in line to be  the next CEO when his father retires. A daughter, Lauren, is president of a facilities management subsidiary. Other children hold ownership stakes in the firm.Buy Photo (Photo: Salwan Georges, Detroit Free Press)The company's motto is "Built for Good," a mantra that emphasizes service to customers, the community and colleagues."We've had a great 100 years," Rakolta said. "There’s very few companies on a national scale that have been able to survive that long. Our goal today is to set this company up to have another 100 years so that the guy sitting in my chair in 2116 will most likely be saying exactly the same things that I’m saying today. Culture is what makes all the difference."Contact John Gallagher: 313-222-5173, gallagher@freepress.com or  on Twitter @jgallagherfreep

         Speaker
John  Rakolta III, WalbridgeSpeaker Bio: As the Executive Director of Business Development, John Rakolta III oversees eight business units for Walbridge, a privately held, Detroit-headquartered construction company founded in 1916. He also serves on the company’s board of directors.  With experience in sales and field operations, his principal activities are to develop strategies for targeted customer relationships, new business venues and global growth initiatives. 

In 2013, John was appointed by Michigan Governor Rick Snyder to the Michigan Economic Development Corporation’s Talent Investment Board. The board, established in 2011, assists and advises the governor regarding compliance with the U.S. Department of Labor Workforce Investment Act and overall talent development in the state.

Prior to joining Walbridge in 2007, he worked for The Athena Group, a real estate development and investment fund with offices in New York, Los Angeles and Washington, DC. 

John is the third-generation member of the Rakolta family to work for Walbridge. His father, John Rakolta, Jr., is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company and he succeeded his father, John Rakolta, Sr., in those roles in 1993. 

In 2013, Walbridge (www.walbridge.com) revenue exceeded $1.3 billion and in 2013 the company was ranked the 45th-largest contractor in the United States by Engineering News-Record, including ranking No. 1 in domestic automotive manufacturing construction and No. 3 in the same category internationally.   The company operates 12 offices in North America, South America and the Middle East. 

John received a bachelor’s degree in building construction management from Purdue University and a master’s degree in real estate finance and investment from New York University. In January 2014, John completed the Program for Leadership Development at the Harvard Business School.
