silvercrest




Silvercrest Asset Management Group is a registered investment advisor that provides asset management and family office services to families and select institutional investors. Clients choose Silvercrest for our integrity, consistency and proven record of success in the financial services industry. Unfettered by affiliations with any bank, broker-dealer or investment bank, Silvercrest is positioned to put our clients' goals first. 
 

It is our goal to provide an unparalleled level of quality advice to every one of our clients. In addition to our modern approach to portfolio construction, we offer a level of personalized service and open communication not found at larger organizations that ensure our clients feel comfortable and secure with choosing Silvercrest.





client focus




Attention to detail, transparency and uncompromising quality of service are paramount in how we manage the wealth of our clients. We listen and help define objectives for the short- and long-term, never employing a cookie-cutter approach, but customizing every portfolio to the specific needs of each client. Silvercrest’s portfolio managers also conduct regular peer reviews to assure that each client is receiving the firm’s best thinking at all times.

 

Additionally, because each senior portfolio manager is a Silvercrest shareholder, each is highly motivated to go the extra mile on behalf of our clients.Finally, beyond our proprietary investment capabilities, we strive to offer our clients greater levels of portfolio diversification through trusted outsourced investment interests.





integrity





In an era of unprecedented consolidation within the financial services industry, many of the great names in private banking and investment counseling have either vanished or sacrificed their independence to become global consolidators. With asset growth and product placement as the main drivers of success among the financial service supermarkets, private-client professionals and their clients alike have been victimized by the consolidators’ business goals of greater scale, enhanced market share and global reach.

  

Silvercrest is home to a dynamic, open business environment where sound ethics, mutual respect and deep integrity are the status quo. Free from the conflicts of interest and office politics of larger corporations, we are better able to guide our clients to their financial goals. We enjoy working with each other and we enjoy working with our clients. The quality, integrity and independence of our advice, coupled with our unwavering commitment to client service, sets us apart in a crowded field.

Alternative Investments
We believe that the inclusion of alternative investments in a portfolio otherwise comprised of traditional investments can have the effect of enhancing the portfolio's return potential while reducing its risk. In the case of hedge funds, we believe it is important to identify managers who are true to their stated investment disciplines, who are staffed and organized properly to manage the money for which they are responsible; and who are correlated to the market indices and to one another, only to a limited degree.
Silvercrest offers its qualified clients a choice of a hedge fund advisory service or access to one or more fund of funds products. The hedge fund advisory service is designed for investors seeking to allocate $25 million or more to hedge funds, while the funds of funds products are designed for investors seeking to allocate $1 million or more.
