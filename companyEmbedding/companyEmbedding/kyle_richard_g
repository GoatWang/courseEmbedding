	Clay Cooper leads the Combustion Design & Technologies section in the Engineering Division at GE Aviation.  In this role, he manages a global team of combustion-disciplined technologists to support fielded products, introduce the newest commercial technologies including the Passport, LEAP, and GE9X, and design the next-generation military, marine, and industrial combustors. 

	Clay joined GE Aviation’s Advanced Combustion group in 2000 after completing his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University.  His early work focused on design and testing of the trapped-vortex combustor (TVC) and the twin-annular premixing swirler (TAPS) combustor.  In 2005 Clay transitioned to the product team leader on the CF34-10 combustion system to complete certification and entry-into-service of that platform.  In 2007, he worked on the team that designed the enhanced TAPS combustion system for the GEnx engine, achieving world-class emissions levels in the aviation industry.

	Currently, as the section manager for combustion at GE Aviation, Clay is actively shaping the product portfolio around new technologies and concepts, partnering with universities and government agencies to explore fundamental understanding of the discipline, and ensuring GE is positioned to provide the best products for customers.  Additionally, he serves as the Executive Sponsor for GE Aiken Junior Scholars team, which introduces STEM topics to 7th-9th graders.  

	Clay lives in Cincinnati, Ohio with his wife Bethany and three children:  Rebekah, Judah, and Anna. 


Jon Douglas
	BSME 1993, MSME 1995
	Director of Engineering, Kysor Warren

	Jon Douglas was recently named the Director of Engineering at Kysor Warren (a division of Lennox Industries), a manufacturer of supermarket refrigeration display cases and systems.  Jon leads engineering, supporting new product design, manufacturing cost reduction, and sales application engineering.

	Prior to joining Kysor Warren, Jon worked in Applied Research at Lennox, leading a variety of new technology programs for residential and light commercial HVAC equipment.  Most recently, his team pioneered the use of “Big Data” to develop a suite of diagnostic features for residential HVAC equipment.  He was also instrumental in the growth of a global engineering team based in Chennai, India.  This team of over 50 engineers provides CFD, FEA, CAD, and value engineering to Lennox HVAC/R business units around the globe.  Throughout his career, Jon has received 15 patents with another 12 in the application process.

	Jon contributes to the HVAC/R industry through participation in various technical committees.  He is an active ASHRAE member and most recently chaired ASHRAE TC 6.3.  Jon is also an active voting member of ASHRAE standards 41, 201P, and 207P.  Jon recently joined the Industrial Advisory Committee at Herrick Labs here at Purdue.

	He enjoys mentoring young engineers helping them learn the “practical” side of engineering.  He was the video director for International Human Powered Submarine Races, an engineering design competition in which students design and race pedal-powered submarines in a US Navy test facility.

	Jon is married to his wonderful wife, Maria.  They have three children; Brielle age 8, Emma age 6, and Parker age 2.  The Douglas’ are enjoying exploring their new home town of Columbus, GA.  In their free time the Douglas’ like to swim, sail, hike, and participate in church activities.


Mark Gritton
	BSME 1980, MSME 1981
	Chief of Research and Technology, Rolls-Royce

	Mark Gritton began his career at Rolls-Royce Corporation in 1980 where he has acquired over 35 years of experience in developing advanced turbomachinery technology. His initial interest was aerodynamics, where he was instrumental in the successful development of many fans and compressors. Subsequently he spent 10 years leading the future application engineering team, developing advanced gas turbine engine concepts to meet future customer requirements. 

	As Capability Owner, Mr. Gritton is accountable for developing and executing the fan and compressor technology strategy at Rolls-Royce Corporation in Indianapolis.  Compressor research led by Professor Nicole Key at the Zucrow Labs is an important element of the Rolls-Royce strategy.


Larry Howell
	Ph.D. 1993
	Associate Dean, College of Engineering, Brigham Young University

	As a young man, Larry Howell enjoyed hiking in the remote mountains near his home town of Portage, Utah, where he discovered a thrill when he realized he may be stepping where no human had ever been before.  This love of going where no one had ever been led him to a career in engineering where he could create new technologies that hadn’t existed before. After graduating in mechanical engineering from Brigham Young University he continued to pursue this drive to design new things as an engineer on the YF-22, the first prototype of the US Air Force F-22 Raptor. Realizing that graduate education would open up more doors to do new things, he continued his education at Purdue University, where he received his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees and also worked as a consulting engineer for Engineering Methods, Inc.

	Professor Howell joined the BYU faculty in 1994 where he and his students’ research has focused on compliant mechanisms, including origami-inspired mechanisms, space mechanisms, microelectromechanical systems, and medical devices. He is the author of the book Compliant Mechanisms, which is the most cited work in the field and has been translated into Chinese.

	Dr. Howell is a Fellow of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Past Chair of the ASME Mechanisms and Robotics Committee, is an associate editor for the Journal of Mechanisms & Robotics and past associate editor of the Journal of Mechanical Design.  His work has been recognized by the ASME Machine Design Award, ASME Mechanisms & Robotics Award, Theodore von Kármán Fellowship, BYU Technology Transfer Award, National Science Foundation Career Award, and Karl G. Maeser Distinguished Lecturer Award, BYU’s highest academic award.

	Larry and his wife, Peggy, live in Orem, Utah and have four children and two grandchildren.

Wondering how Kyle Richards gets such lustrous, flowing locks? It turns out that despite her access to anything in the world, the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star doesn't splurge when it comes to her 'tresses.
Describing herself as a "less-is-more person when it comes my hair," she told HuffPost Live that one of her secret is that "I don't put product in it." 
But when she does use something, it's not some pricey designer product like you might expect. It's actually pretty easily accessible and affordable.
"I do use Pantene," she revealed. "I really do. And I'm not a spokesperson for them, but I really do use it."
The RHOBH star then further elaborated about why she doesn't like to overwork her hair. "I don't put product in my hair because it dulls the shine," she said. "And I try not to overheat it. I try not to damage it with brushing. You just have to take care of it like you would your skin."
Earlier this year, Kyle also shared some of her diet secrets. "I eat almost no sugar," she said of her diet, revealing why she is so strict when it comes to what she takes in.
"I'm only 5-foot-2, with big boobs and a butt, so it shows!" she said. "I feel confident about my body now. I don't hide behind a towel in a bathing suit."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
