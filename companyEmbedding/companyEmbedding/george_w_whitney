Job Details
               Located in Kennebunk, Maine, the Astronomical Society of Northern New England (ASNNE) is an all-volunteer non-profit educational organization founded in 1982 to promote public awareness of astronomy. ASNNE encourages schools, scout troops and other community groups to contact us for presentations, observing sessions and slide shows. We design all programs to fit the particular group. These programs cost nothing and the speakers are not paid. However, all donations to ASNNE are welcomed. Over the years we have hosted approximately hundress ofstar parties for over an estimated 20,000 children and adults. With the opening of the observatory we look to dramatically increase our public education activities. In addition, ASNNE holds monthly business meetings with strong educational components. The meetings are open to the public. Over the years a number of distinguished speakers in astronomy and related fields have spoken to us. Meetings are held the first Friday of each month 7:30pm at the New School in Kennebunk, Maine. Monthly observing sessions are typically held the Friday closest to the new moon, with a rain date the following evening.

Hi...I found several posts from you regarding George W. Whitney in Michigan.You made those posts years ago, so hopefully this is still a valid email address.You mentioned in your posts that he was married and left his family for some reason, never to be heard from again.I have a George W. Whitney in my family, (he was my Great-great grand father) and somewhere, years ago, I remember someone saying that they thought he had a first wife that no one knew anything about.  I also remember hearing that for some reason they felt that there had been some sort of a break from his family, possibly that he was disowned.My George W. Whitney did live in Michigan...but I have been unable to find anything about his life, prior to his marriage to my great-great grandmother.I'd love to speak with you and find out if our George Whitneys are the same person.Just as a side note, do you happen to have a picture of him?  I have a few pictures and if you have any, it would be great to compare.My name is Rachael, you can contact me through Ancestry.com, by username is Arleygirl.OR you can just give me a call, which would probably be easier.  My cell is: 616.308.6922Thank you and I hope to hear from you,Rachael
