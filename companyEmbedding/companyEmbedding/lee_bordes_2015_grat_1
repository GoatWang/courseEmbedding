Cidu Bill on Dec 22nd 2015 


Okay, seriously, is there a joke here? 
And a No-Shave November strip on December 19??

I am really surprised that Mason got the word âdingleberriesâ past the syndicateâs censors. In truth: âEewwwww!â
P.S. I had never heard of âNo Shave Novemberâ before. It is that popular?

P.P.S. @4 - Just because something has a Wikipedia page doesnât mean that it is well-known. My question is whether this silly(*) promotion is popular enough to make the comment understandable to a majority (or even a sufficient minority) of the syndicateâs readership.
P.P.P.S. The âice bucketâ challenge was even sillier, but more popular, perhaps because it wasnât inherently limited to 50% of the population.

âJust because something has a Wikipedia page doesnât mean that it is well-known.â
Um, OKâ¦ but I didnât make any such claim.
I know about it because the NFL supports it.  (Well, at least, several NFL players haveâ¦ it does not have the same level of support as the breast-cancer awareness gets.)
âThe âice bucketâ challenge was even sillier, but more popular, perhaps because it wasnât inherently limited to 50% of the population.â
The Komen Foundation limits participation in the ârace for the cureâ events, and theyâre plenty popular.

Movember has been going for more than a decade.
The Ice Bucket Challenge lasted a couple months.
Calling the Ice Bucket Challenge more popular isâ¦odd.

@ James P, #6:
No, you didnât make any such claim - and Kilby didnât  impose so onto you. 
I rather get it as he has met people, like my 36 yo (in addition to MScEE

@ Kamino Neko (7) - I really have never seen or heard of this âno shavingâ promotion ever before. If theyâve been operating for a decade, theyâve managed to keep a pretty low profile. Perhaps it depends on the location. The ice bucket idiocy may have been short-lived, but while it lasted, it was a perpetual irritant in the German news media.

Mo-vember has been a thing for quite some time now, so I got the No-Shave November reference. 
Iâm sure this disgusting âjokeâ was gleaned from a real life incident with the artistâs own dog back in November (delayed trip to the groomer, dog walks past with some dingleberries, it writes itself!). Maybe next time he should just tell the joke to his wife instead of syndicating it.

I am a little surprised that some have not heard of the annual âMovemberâ event, but FWIW, my exposure to it is almost strictly online.  While I might see a participant with a temporal mustache growth, I rarely ever hear anybody talking about in âreal lifeâ.
On a separate point, a few years ago, my wife referred to me as a âdingleberryâ in a joking fashion.   When I called her to task for calling me a piece of excrement, she was bewildered.  In her mind, the expression was roughly analogous to âgoofballâ.    When I told her the actual definition, she thought I was making it up.

As with many words, there are several definitions for dingleberry.  Judge Mentalâs wife was not incorrect (according to freedictionary.com).  Also, Merriam Webster says the dingleberry is a shrub (with edible fruitâ¦ and therefore, PIES!) of the SE US.  Dingleberry as fecal matter is also defined in several dicitonaries (including the Urban one), but was a new definition to me.

Iâve heard of âMovemberâ, but Iâve never heard (or seen) it called âNo Shave Novemberâ, although the Wikipedia âMovemberâ page gives that term as an alternate name.  Iâve participated in it every year, starting at least a couple of decades before the term âMovemberâ was coined.  Also no-shave January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, and December.  The last time I shaved my beard was in June of 1979, and I donât remember when before that I shaved my moustache, but I think that it was probably around the early 1970s.
A few years ago, I got asked, in October, whether my beard was a Red Sox beard.
The moustache gets trimmed a few times a year, when it starts getting in the way of playing woodwind instruments, and the beard gets trimmed fairly short every year near the beginning of winter, because when itâs long it tends to accumulate breath-condensation icicles, especially while Iâm skiing.

I think that all the people here using âMovemberâ as âthis is what âNo-shave-vemberâ is shows that itâs not as well known as I thought. Among the people I know who show up, the ârulesâ are fairly strict - Movember is strictly about growing a mustache. And only a mustache. No-shave-bember (and Iâve never seen anyone doing this who has signed up) includes all facial hair.

@ 12,13,15 - I was just about to make a derisive comment about the unreliability of online dictionaries, and was going to cite the dependable definitions given by my two favorite hardbound editions. Alas, neither American Heritage nor the Concise OED lists the word âdingleberryâ at all. Oh well. Maybe the censors didnât flag it because they didnât know what it meant?

I have to admit that I didnât know what a dingleberry was until I read the comments under this BC when it appeared last Saturday. Now that I know, I see no way this oneâs arlo-ness is accidental. Nor do I see why
the âNo Shave Novemberâ thing was in a mid-December strip.
BTW, the local TV news anchormen participated in âMovemberâ and were looking pretty good by the end of the month. Then, for reasons unfathomable to me, they reverted to shaving.

âthe local TV news anchormen participated in âMovemberâ and were looking pretty good by the end of the month. Then, for reasons unfathomable to me, they reverted to shavingâ
Because focus-group testing says that clean-shaven men are more believable, more authoritative, or both.

I generally have a mouth-and-chin beard (not really âgoateeâ) for warm weather, then let it go full-but-trimmed for the cold months.  I think I started just after Thanksgiving this year, so it was kinda in November.  But I still shave almost daily (throat and upper face) so it wouldnât qualify on that count anyway.  
And I join with those who are distinguishing Movember and No-Shave. 
I occasionally get celebrity-resemblance remarks regarding George Lucas. (âHas anybody ever told you you look like..?â)   But I hadnât heard that in quite a while, only to hear it two days in a row last week[*].  It must be based on my white fringe.  
[*] Though the clerk at CVS actually said Steven Spielberg.  But she meant George Lucas.

âDingleberriesâ was around as a word in the 1970âs.  It even appeared in an underground comic from that era.
(Remember underground comix?  I miss them.)

James Pollock (6) - donât assume the no shave is limited to 50% of the population - but it may be âno pluckâ instead.
Never heard of this before either.

While I got what the comic was going for, there was something that just now clicked for me in regards to the specific dialogue.  I might have been the only one, but just in case:
The phrase âHis dingleberries are never that longâ is intended to be parsed as âHis dingleberries are never that long (as they are now)â.  I was interpreting ânever that longâ to mean ânever particularly longâ and that âneverâ really meant never (i.e. including now).      I would have been a little quicker on the uptake if it had said âhave never been that long (before)â

âdonât assume the no shave is limited to 50% of the population - but it may be âno pluckâ instead.â
Okay, but this is ANOTHER claim I never made.
I referred to the Komen foundationâs key event, which IS limited to 50% of the population, despite the fact that the cause they are fighting is NOT limited to 50% of the population.  The Movember groupâs cause IS limited to 50% of the population.

Lee County was created in 1887 from Monroe County.[3] It was named for Robert E. Lee, Confederate general in the American Civil War.[4]
Incorporated in 1886, Fort Myers is the center of a popular tourist area in Southwest Florida and the seat of Lee County. It is about 120 miles (190Â km) south of Tampa at the meeting point of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caloosahatchee River. Fort Myers was the frequent winter home of Thomas Edison, as well as Henry Ford.[5] Lee County has been the host to several Major League Baseball teams for Spring Training, over the past several decades. Currently, it is the spring home of the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Minnesota Twins.
Fort Myers, built in 1850 as a military fort to fend off Seminole Indians, was named after Col. Abraham C. Myers, who was stationed in Florida for seven years and was the son-in-law of the fortâs establisher and commander. In 1858, after years of elusive battle, chief Billy Bowlegs and his warriors were persuaded to surrender and move west, and the fort was abandoned. Billyâs Creek, which flows into the Caloosahatchee River, was named after a temporary camp where Billy Bowlegs and his men awaited ships to take them west.
In 1863, the fort was reoccupied by Federal troops during the Civil War. In 1865 the fort was attacked unsuccessfully by a small group of Confederates. After the war, the fort was again deserted.
The first settlers arrived in 1866, but it was not until 1882 when the city experienced a significant influx of settlers. By 1885, when Fort Myers was incorporated, it was the second largest city only to Tampa on Floridaâs west coast south of Cedar Key, even larger than Clearwater and Sarasota, also growing cities at the time.
Fort Myers first became a nationally known winter resort with the building of The Royal Palm Hotel in 1898. But what really sparked the cityâs growth was the construction of the Tamiami Trail Bridge built across the Caloosahatchee River in 1924. After the bridgeâs construction, the city experienced its first real estate boom and many subdivisions sprouted around the city.
In the 1870s, Tervio Padilla, a wealthy merchant from the Canary Islands, came by way of Key West to Cayo Costa and established trade with natives and âranchosâ that extended northward to Charlotte Harbor. His ships often made port at Cayo Costa at the entrance to the harbor. Enchanted by the tropical island, he eventually decided to settle there. Padilla prospered until the outbreak of the SpanishâAmerican War when his fleet was burned and scuttled. He then turned to another means of livelihood â fishing. When the government claimed his land he was disinclined to set up another ranch so moved with his wife further down the island and as before, simply homesteaded . The Padilla family is one of the first pioneer families of Lee County and many still reside within the county mainly around the Pine Island area.
In 1923, Collier and Hendry Counties were created by splitting these areas from Lee County.
On August 13, 2004, the county was struck by Hurricane Charley, a Category 4 storm, particularly on the northwestern islands of Captiva, Gasparilla and North Captiva.
Geography[edit]
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,212 square miles (3,140Â km2), of which 785 square miles (2,030Â km2) is land and 428 square miles (1,110Â km2) (35.3%) is water.[6] Rivers and streams include the Caloosahatchee River, the Imperial River, the Estero River, Hendry Creek, and Orange River.
Lee County is on the southwest coast of Florida. It is approximately 125 miles (201Â km) south of Tampa and 115 miles (185Â km) west of Fort Lauderdale via Interstate 75; and approximately 125 miles (201Â km) west-northwest of Miami via U.S. Highway 41.

Climate[edit]
Lee County has a year-round warm, monsoon-influenced climate that is close to the boundary between tropical and subtropical climates (18Â Â°C (64Â Â°F) in the coldest month), and is thus either classified as a humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen Cfa), which is the classification used by NOAA,[7][8] or a tropical savanna climate (KÃ¶ppen Aw).[9] Lee County has short, warm winters, and long, hot, humid summers, with most of the year's rainfall falling from June to September. The temperature rarely rises to 100Â Â°F (38Â Â°C) or lowers to the freezing mark.[10] At 89, Lee County leads the nation in the number of days annually in which a thunderstorm is close enough for thunder to be heard.[11] The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 64.2Â Â°F (17.9Â Â°C) in January to 83.4Â Â°F (28.6Â Â°C) in August, with the annual mean being 75.1Â Â°F (23.9Â Â°C). Records range from 24Â Â°F (â4Â Â°C) on December 29, 1894 up to 103Â Â°F (39Â Â°C) on June 16â17, 1981.[10]

Seaports and marine transport[edit]
A small port operation continues in Boca Grande, being used as a way-point for oil distribution. However, Port Boca Grande has been in decline for many years as the shipping industry has moved north, especially to the Port of Tampa.
In addition, a private enterprise operates a high-speed passenger-only ferry service between Fort Myers Beach From San Carlos Island and Key West. Another ferry service is offered from Fort Myers to Key West
Major highways[edit]

MLB spring training[edit]




Red Sox logo on the fence outside the City of Palms Park


The Boston Red Sox hold their annual spring training at JetBlue Park in the Fort Myers area. A cross-town rivalry has developed with the Minnesota Twins, who conduct their spring training at Hammond Stadium in south Lee County, which has a capacity of 7,500 and opened in 1991.
The Red Sox' lease with Fort Myers runs through 2019, but the Red Sox were considering exercising the early out in their contract that would have allowed them to leave following the 2009 spring season. On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3â1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. The new stadium, named JetBlue Park at Fenway South, is located off Daniels Parkway near Southwest Florida International Airport. The stadium opened in time for the 2012 Spring training season.
City of Palms Park had been built in 1992 for the Red Sox' spring training. Former Red Sox left fielder Mike Greenwell is from Fort Myers, and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for spring training.[citation needed] The deal for JetBlue Park left City of Palms Park without a tenant. County officials have discussed the possibility of securing another team for City of Palms. Terry Park Ballfield (also known as the Park T. Pigott Memorial Stadium) in East Fort Myers is also not currently in use by a Major League Baseball team, though it is the former home of the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals.

Lee County was created in 1887 from Monroe County.[3] It was named for Robert E. Lee, Confederate general in the American Civil War.[4]
Incorporated in 1886, Fort Myers is the center of a popular tourist area in Southwest Florida and the seat of Lee County. It is about 120 miles (190Â km) south of Tampa at the meeting point of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caloosahatchee River. Fort Myers was the frequent winter home of Thomas Edison, as well as Henry Ford.[5] Lee County has been the host to several Major League Baseball teams for Spring Training, over the past several decades. Currently, it is the spring home of the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Minnesota Twins.
Fort Myers, built in 1850 as a military fort to fend off Seminole Indians, was named after Col. Abraham C. Myers, who was stationed in Florida for seven years and was the son-in-law of the fortâs establisher and commander. In 1858, after years of elusive battle, chief Billy Bowlegs and his warriors were persuaded to surrender and move west, and the fort was abandoned. Billyâs Creek, which flows into the Caloosahatchee River, was named after a temporary camp where Billy Bowlegs and his men awaited ships to take them west.
In 1863, the fort was reoccupied by Federal troops during the Civil War. In 1865 the fort was attacked unsuccessfully by a small group of Confederates. After the war, the fort was again deserted.
The first settlers arrived in 1866, but it was not until 1882 when the city experienced a significant influx of settlers. By 1885, when Fort Myers was incorporated, it was the second largest city only to Tampa on Floridaâs west coast south of Cedar Key, even larger than Clearwater and Sarasota, also growing cities at the time.
Fort Myers first became a nationally known winter resort with the building of The Royal Palm Hotel in 1898. But what really sparked the cityâs growth was the construction of the Tamiami Trail Bridge built across the Caloosahatchee River in 1924. After the bridgeâs construction, the city experienced its first real estate boom and many subdivisions sprouted around the city.
In the 1870s, Tervio Padilla, a wealthy merchant from the Canary Islands, came by way of Key West to Cayo Costa and established trade with natives and âranchosâ that extended northward to Charlotte Harbor. His ships often made port at Cayo Costa at the entrance to the harbor. Enchanted by the tropical island, he eventually decided to settle there. Padilla prospered until the outbreak of the SpanishâAmerican War when his fleet was burned and scuttled. He then turned to another means of livelihood â fishing. When the government claimed his land he was disinclined to set up another ranch so moved with his wife further down the island and as before, simply homesteaded . The Padilla family is one of the first pioneer families of Lee County and many still reside within the county mainly around the Pine Island area.
In 1923, Collier and Hendry Counties were created by splitting these areas from Lee County.
On August 13, 2004, the county was struck by Hurricane Charley, a Category 4 storm, particularly on the northwestern islands of Captiva, Gasparilla and North Captiva.
Geography[edit]
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,212 square miles (3,140Â km2), of which 785 square miles (2,030Â km2) is land and 428 square miles (1,110Â km2) (35.3%) is water.[6] Rivers and streams include the Caloosahatchee River, the Imperial River, the Estero River, Hendry Creek, and Orange River.
Lee County is on the southwest coast of Florida. It is approximately 125 miles (201Â km) south of Tampa and 115 miles (185Â km) west of Fort Lauderdale via Interstate 75; and approximately 125 miles (201Â km) west-northwest of Miami via U.S. Highway 41.

Climate[edit]
Lee County has a year-round warm, monsoon-influenced climate that is close to the boundary between tropical and subtropical climates (18Â Â°C (64Â Â°F) in the coldest month), and is thus either classified as a humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen Cfa), which is the classification used by NOAA,[7][8] or a tropical savanna climate (KÃ¶ppen Aw).[9] Lee County has short, warm winters, and long, hot, humid summers, with most of the year's rainfall falling from June to September. The temperature rarely rises to 100Â Â°F (38Â Â°C) or lowers to the freezing mark.[10] At 89, Lee County leads the nation in the number of days annually in which a thunderstorm is close enough for thunder to be heard.[11] The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 64.2Â Â°F (17.9Â Â°C) in January to 83.4Â Â°F (28.6Â Â°C) in August, with the annual mean being 75.1Â Â°F (23.9Â Â°C). Records range from 24Â Â°F (â4Â Â°C) on December 29, 1894 up to 103Â Â°F (39Â Â°C) on June 16â17, 1981.[10]

Southwest Florida International Airport, in South Fort Myers, serves over 8.37 million passengers annually.[31] Currently, the airport offers international non-stop flights to Cancun, Mexico; DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany; Nassau, Bahamas; and Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto in Canada. In addition, nine airlines operate flights to 29 domestic non-stop destinations. On September 9, 2005, the airport opened a new terminal.






Page Field, also in South Fort Myers, just south of the incorporated limits of the City of Fort Myers, is the county's general aviation airport. Prior to the opening of Southwest Florida Regional Airport in 1983 (now Southwest Florida International Airport), Page Field was the county's commercial airport.



Seaports and marine transport[edit]
A small port operation continues in Boca Grande, being used as a way-point for oil distribution. However, Port Boca Grande has been in decline for many years as the shipping industry has moved north, especially to the Port of Tampa.
In addition, a private enterprise operates a high-speed passenger-only ferry service between Fort Myers Beach From San Carlos Island and Key West. Another ferry service is offered from Fort Myers to Key West
Major highways[edit]



Interstate 75
The county's only fully controlled-access freeway, and has ten interchanges within Lee County, linking the area to Naples, Fort Lauderdale and Miami to the south and east; and Sarasota and Tampa to the north.

Within Cape Coral, the highway is named "Veterans' Memorial Parkway", and is a multi-lane controlled access highway. Within Fort Myers, it is named "Colonial Boulevard". The road crosses the Caloosahatchee River as an elevated highway across a toll bridge, interchanging with U.S. Highway 41 and Interstate 75, then becomes a multi-lane divided surface highway through Lehigh Acres. After it intersects with State Road 82, it is called "Lee Boulevard".

MLB spring training[edit]




Red Sox logo on the fence outside the City of Palms Park


The Boston Red Sox hold their annual spring training at JetBlue Park in the Fort Myers area. A cross-town rivalry has developed with the Minnesota Twins, who conduct their spring training at Hammond Stadium in south Lee County, which has a capacity of 7,500 and opened in 1991.
The Red Sox' lease with Fort Myers runs through 2019, but the Red Sox were considering exercising the early out in their contract that would have allowed them to leave following the 2009 spring season. On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3â1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. The new stadium, named JetBlue Park at Fenway South, is located off Daniels Parkway near Southwest Florida International Airport. The stadium opened in time for the 2012 Spring training season.
City of Palms Park had been built in 1992 for the Red Sox' spring training. Former Red Sox left fielder Mike Greenwell is from Fort Myers, and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for spring training.[citation needed] The deal for JetBlue Park left City of Palms Park without a tenant. County officials have discussed the possibility of securing another team for City of Palms. Terry Park Ballfield (also known as the Park T. Pigott Memorial Stadium) in East Fort Myers is also not currently in use by a Major League Baseball team, though it is the former home of the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals.

Lee County was created in 1887 from Monroe County.[3] It was named for Robert E. Lee, Confederate general in the American Civil War.[4]
Incorporated in 1886, Fort Myers is the center of a popular tourist area in Southwest Florida and the seat of Lee County. It is about 120 miles (190Â km) south of Tampa at the meeting point of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caloosahatchee River. Fort Myers was the frequent winter home of Thomas Edison, as well as Henry Ford.[5] Lee County has been the host to several Major League Baseball teams for Spring Training, over the past several decades. Currently, it is the spring home of the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Minnesota Twins.
Fort Myers, built in 1850 as a military fort to fend off Seminole Indians, was named after Col. Abraham C. Myers, who was stationed in Florida for seven years and was the son-in-law of the fortâs establisher and commander. In 1858, after years of elusive battle, chief Billy Bowlegs and his warriors were persuaded to surrender and move west, and the fort was abandoned. Billyâs Creek, which flows into the Caloosahatchee River, was named after a temporary camp where Billy Bowlegs and his men awaited ships to take them west.
In 1863, the fort was reoccupied by Federal troops during the Civil War. In 1865 the fort was attacked unsuccessfully by a small group of Confederates. After the war, the fort was again deserted.
The first settlers arrived in 1866, but it was not until 1882 when the city experienced a significant influx of settlers. By 1885, when Fort Myers was incorporated, it was the second largest city only to Tampa on Floridaâs west coast south of Cedar Key, even larger than Clearwater and Sarasota, also growing cities at the time.
Fort Myers first became a nationally known winter resort with the building of The Royal Palm Hotel in 1898. But what really sparked the cityâs growth was the construction of the Tamiami Trail Bridge built across the Caloosahatchee River in 1924. After the bridgeâs construction, the city experienced its first real estate boom and many subdivisions sprouted around the city.
In the 1870s, Tervio Padilla, a wealthy merchant from the Canary Islands, came by way of Key West to Cayo Costa and established trade with natives and âranchosâ that extended northward to Charlotte Harbor. His ships often made port at Cayo Costa at the entrance to the harbor. Enchanted by the tropical island, he eventually decided to settle there. Padilla prospered until the outbreak of the SpanishâAmerican War when his fleet was burned and scuttled. He then turned to another means of livelihood â fishing. When the government claimed his land he was disinclined to set up another ranch so moved with his wife further down the island and as before, simply homesteaded . The Padilla family is one of the first pioneer families of Lee County and many still reside within the county mainly around the Pine Island area.
In 1923, Collier and Hendry Counties were created by splitting these areas from Lee County.
On August 13, 2004, the county was struck by Hurricane Charley, a Category 4 storm, particularly on the northwestern islands of Captiva, Gasparilla and North Captiva.
Geography[edit]
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,212 square miles (3,140Â km2), of which 785 square miles (2,030Â km2) is land and 428 square miles (1,110Â km2) (35.3%) is water.[6] Rivers and streams include the Caloosahatchee River, the Imperial River, the Estero River, Hendry Creek, and Orange River.
Lee County is on the southwest coast of Florida. It is approximately 125 miles (201Â km) south of Tampa and 115 miles (185Â km) west of Fort Lauderdale via Interstate 75; and approximately 125 miles (201Â km) west-northwest of Miami via U.S. Highway 41.

Climate[edit]
Lee County has a year-round warm, monsoon-influenced climate that is close to the boundary between tropical and subtropical climates (18Â Â°C (64Â Â°F) in the coldest month), and is thus either classified as a humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen Cfa), which is the classification used by NOAA,[7][8] or a tropical savanna climate (KÃ¶ppen Aw).[9] Lee County has short, warm winters, and long, hot, humid summers, with most of the year's rainfall falling from June to September. The temperature rarely rises to 100Â Â°F (38Â Â°C) or lowers to the freezing mark.[10] At 89, Lee County leads the nation in the number of days annually in which a thunderstorm is close enough for thunder to be heard.[11] The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 64.2Â Â°F (17.9Â Â°C) in January to 83.4Â Â°F (28.6Â Â°C) in August, with the annual mean being 75.1Â Â°F (23.9Â Â°C). Records range from 24Â Â°F (â4Â Â°C) on December 29, 1894 up to 103Â Â°F (39Â Â°C) on June 16â17, 1981.[10]

Airports[edit]



Southwest Florida International Airport, in South Fort Myers, serves over 8.37 million passengers annually.[31] Currently, the airport offers international non-stop flights to Cancun, Mexico; DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany; Nassau, Bahamas; and Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto in Canada. In addition, nine airlines operate flights to 29 domestic non-stop destinations. On September 9, 2005, the airport opened a new terminal.






Page Field, also in South Fort Myers, just south of the incorporated limits of the City of Fort Myers, is the county's general aviation airport. Prior to the opening of Southwest Florida Regional Airport in 1983 (now Southwest Florida International Airport), Page Field was the county's commercial airport.



Seaports and marine transport[edit]
A small port operation continues in Boca Grande, being used as a way-point for oil distribution. However, Port Boca Grande has been in decline for many years as the shipping industry has moved north, especially to the Port of Tampa.
In addition, a private enterprise operates a high-speed passenger-only ferry service between Fort Myers Beach From San Carlos Island and Key West. Another ferry service is offered from Fort Myers to Key West
Major highways[edit]

USÂ 41 runs the length of Lee County, and is the county's main north-south arterial highway. It is a major commercial corridor, running as an elevated highway through the center of downtown Fort Myers, continuing south as a multi-lane divided surface highway through the communities of South Fort Myers, San Carlos Park, Estero, and Bonita Springs. From north-to-south, the highway's name starts as "North Tamiami Trail", changes to "Cleveland Avenue" from the Caloosahatchee River to State Road 884 (Colonial Boulevard) in the City of Fort Myers; then it is called "South Cleveland Avenue" from Colonial Boulevard to County Road 876 (Daniels Parkway), and then changes to South Tamiami Trail until the border with Collier County.



State Road 80
Palm Beach Boulevard
SRÂ 80's western terminus is in downtown Fort Myers. The multi-lane highway runs east-northeast along the southern banks of the Caloosahatchee River as "Palm Beach Boulevard" within the county, traversing the state of Florida to connect the area with LaBelle, Clewiston, and West Palm Beach.



State Road 82
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard
Immokalee Road
SRÂ 82's western terminus is in downtown Fort Myers. The highway is called "Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard" within the incorporated limits of the City of Fort Myers, becoming "Immokalee Road" as it passes through Lehigh Acres and connects the area to Immokalee.



State Road 884
Veterans Memorial Parkway
Colonial Boulevard
Lee Boulevard
SRÂ 884 is Lee County's main east-west arterial highway. Its western terminus is in the incorporated limits of the City of Cape Coral and the eastern terminus is in Lehigh Acres. Within Cape Coral, the highway is named "Veterans' Memorial Parkway", and is a multi-lane controlled access highway. Within Fort Myers, it is named "Colonial Boulevard". The road crosses the Caloosahatchee River as an elevated highway across a toll bridge, interchanging with U.S. Highway 41 and Interstate 75, then becomes a multi-lane divided surface highway through Lehigh Acres. After it intersects with State Road 82, it is called "Lee Boulevard".

MLB spring training[edit]

The Boston Red Sox hold their annual spring training at JetBlue Park in the Fort Myers area. A cross-town rivalry has developed with the Minnesota Twins, who conduct their spring training at Hammond Stadium in south Lee County, which has a capacity of 7,500 and opened in 1991.
The Red Sox' lease with Fort Myers runs through 2019, but the Red Sox were considering exercising the early out in their contract that would have allowed them to leave following the 2009 spring season. On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3â1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. The new stadium, named JetBlue Park at Fenway South, is located off Daniels Parkway near Southwest Florida International Airport. The stadium opened in time for the 2012 Spring training season.
City of Palms Park had been built in 1992 for the Red Sox' spring training. Former Red Sox left fielder Mike Greenwell is from Fort Myers, and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for spring training.[citation needed] The deal for JetBlue Park left City of Palms Park without a tenant. County officials have discussed the possibility of securing another team for City of Palms. Terry Park Ballfield (also known as the Park T. Pigott Memorial Stadium) in East Fort Myers is also not currently in use by a Major League Baseball team, though it is the former home of the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals.

Lee County was created in 1887 from Monroe County.[3] It was named for Robert E. Lee, Confederate general in the American Civil War.[4]
Incorporated in 1886, Fort Myers is the center of a popular tourist area in Southwest Florida and the seat of Lee County. It is about 120 miles (190Â km) south of Tampa at the meeting point of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caloosahatchee River. Fort Myers was the frequent winter home of Thomas Edison, as well as Henry Ford.[5] Lee County has been the host to several Major League Baseball teams for Spring Training, over the past several decades. Currently, it is the spring home of the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Minnesota Twins.
Fort Myers, built in 1850 as a military fort to fend off Seminole Indians, was named after Col. Abraham C. Myers, who was stationed in Florida for seven years and was the son-in-law of the fortâs establisher and commander. In 1858, after years of elusive battle, chief Billy Bowlegs and his warriors were persuaded to surrender and move west, and the fort was abandoned. Billyâs Creek, which flows into the Caloosahatchee River, was named after a temporary camp where Billy Bowlegs and his men awaited ships to take them west.
In 1863, the fort was reoccupied by Federal troops during the Civil War. In 1865 the fort was attacked unsuccessfully by a small group of Confederates. After the war, the fort was again deserted.
The first settlers arrived in 1866, but it was not until 1882 when the city experienced a significant influx of settlers. By 1885, when Fort Myers was incorporated, it was the second largest city only to Tampa on Floridaâs west coast south of Cedar Key, even larger than Clearwater and Sarasota, also growing cities at the time.
Fort Myers first became a nationally known winter resort with the building of The Royal Palm Hotel in 1898. But what really sparked the cityâs growth was the construction of the Tamiami Trail Bridge built across the Caloosahatchee River in 1924. After the bridgeâs construction, the city experienced its first real estate boom and many subdivisions sprouted around the city.
In the 1870s, Tervio Padilla, a wealthy merchant from the Canary Islands, came by way of Key West to Cayo Costa and established trade with natives and âranchosâ that extended northward to Charlotte Harbor. His ships often made port at Cayo Costa at the entrance to the harbor. Enchanted by the tropical island, he eventually decided to settle there. Padilla prospered until the outbreak of the SpanishâAmerican War when his fleet was burned and scuttled. He then turned to another means of livelihood â fishing. When the government claimed his land he was disinclined to set up another ranch so moved with his wife further down the island and as before, simply homesteaded . The Padilla family is one of the first pioneer families of Lee County and many still reside within the county mainly around the Pine Island area.
In 1923, Collier and Hendry Counties were created by splitting these areas from Lee County.
On August 13, 2004, the county was struck by Hurricane Charley, a Category 4 storm, particularly on the northwestern islands of Captiva, Gasparilla and North Captiva.
Geography[edit]
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,212 square miles (3,140Â km2), of which 785 square miles (2,030Â km2) is land and 428 square miles (1,110Â km2) (35.3%) is water.[6] Rivers and streams include the Caloosahatchee River, the Imperial River, the Estero River, Hendry Creek, and Orange River.
Lee County is on the southwest coast of Florida. It is approximately 125 miles (201Â km) south of Tampa and 115 miles (185Â km) west of Fort Lauderdale via Interstate 75; and approximately 125 miles (201Â km) west-northwest of Miami via U.S. Highway 41.

Lee County has a year-round warm, monsoon-influenced climate that is close to the boundary between tropical and subtropical climates (18Â Â°C (64Â Â°F) in the coldest month), and is thus either classified as a humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen Cfa), which is the classification used by NOAA,[7][8] or a tropical savanna climate (KÃ¶ppen Aw).[9] Lee County has short, warm winters, and long, hot, humid summers, with most of the year's rainfall falling from June to September. The temperature rarely rises to 100Â Â°F (38Â Â°C) or lowers to the freezing mark.[10] At 89, Lee County leads the nation in the number of days annually in which a thunderstorm is close enough for thunder to be heard.[11] The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 64.2Â Â°F (17.9Â Â°C) in January to 83.4Â Â°F (28.6Â Â°C) in August, with the annual mean being 75.1Â Â°F (23.9Â Â°C). Records range from 24Â Â°F (â4Â Â°C) on December 29, 1894 up to 103Â Â°F (39Â Â°C) on June 16â17, 1981.[10]

A small port operation continues in Boca Grande, being used as a way-point for oil distribution. However, Port Boca Grande has been in decline for many years as the shipping industry has moved north, especially to the Port of Tampa.
In addition, a private enterprise operates a high-speed passenger-only ferry service between Fort Myers Beach From San Carlos Island and Key West. Another ferry service is offered from Fort Myers to Key West
Major highways[edit]

MLB spring training[edit]




Red Sox logo on the fence outside the City of Palms Park


The Boston Red Sox hold their annual spring training at JetBlue Park in the Fort Myers area. A cross-town rivalry has developed with the Minnesota Twins, who conduct their spring training at Hammond Stadium in south Lee County, which has a capacity of 7,500 and opened in 1991.
The Red Sox' lease with Fort Myers runs through 2019, but the Red Sox were considering exercising the early out in their contract that would have allowed them to leave following the 2009 spring season. On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3â1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. The new stadium, named JetBlue Park at Fenway South, is located off Daniels Parkway near Southwest Florida International Airport. The stadium opened in time for the 2012 Spring training season.
City of Palms Park had been built in 1992 for the Red Sox' spring training. Former Red Sox left fielder Mike Greenwell is from Fort Myers, and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for spring training.[citation needed] The deal for JetBlue Park left City of Palms Park without a tenant. County officials have discussed the possibility of securing another team for City of Palms. Terry Park Ballfield (also known as the Park T. Pigott Memorial Stadium) in East Fort Myers is also not currently in use by a Major League Baseball team, though it is the former home of the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals.

Lee County was created in 1887 from Monroe County.[3] It was named for Robert E. Lee, Confederate general in the American Civil War.[4]
Incorporated in 1886, Fort Myers is the center of a popular tourist area in Southwest Florida and the seat of Lee County. It is about 120 miles (190Â km) south of Tampa at the meeting point of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caloosahatchee River. Fort Myers was the frequent winter home of Thomas Edison, as well as Henry Ford.[5] Lee County has been the host to several Major League Baseball teams for Spring Training, over the past several decades. Currently, it is the spring home of the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Minnesota Twins.
Fort Myers, built in 1850 as a military fort to fend off Seminole Indians, was named after Col. Abraham C. Myers, who was stationed in Florida for seven years and was the son-in-law of the fortâs establisher and commander. In 1858, after years of elusive battle, chief Billy Bowlegs and his warriors were persuaded to surrender and move west, and the fort was abandoned. Billyâs Creek, which flows into the Caloosahatchee River, was named after a temporary camp where Billy Bowlegs and his men awaited ships to take them west.
In 1863, the fort was reoccupied by Federal troops during the Civil War. In 1865 the fort was attacked unsuccessfully by a small group of Confederates. After the war, the fort was again deserted.
The first settlers arrived in 1866, but it was not until 1882 when the city experienced a significant influx of settlers. By 1885, when Fort Myers was incorporated, it was the second largest city only to Tampa on Floridaâs west coast south of Cedar Key, even larger than Clearwater and Sarasota, also growing cities at the time.
Fort Myers first became a nationally known winter resort with the building of The Royal Palm Hotel in 1898. But what really sparked the cityâs growth was the construction of the Tamiami Trail Bridge built across the Caloosahatchee River in 1924. After the bridgeâs construction, the city experienced its first real estate boom and many subdivisions sprouted around the city.
In the 1870s, Tervio Padilla, a wealthy merchant from the Canary Islands, came by way of Key West to Cayo Costa and established trade with natives and âranchosâ that extended northward to Charlotte Harbor. His ships often made port at Cayo Costa at the entrance to the harbor. Enchanted by the tropical island, he eventually decided to settle there. Padilla prospered until the outbreak of the SpanishâAmerican War when his fleet was burned and scuttled. He then turned to another means of livelihood â fishing. When the government claimed his land he was disinclined to set up another ranch so moved with his wife further down the island and as before, simply homesteaded . The Padilla family is one of the first pioneer families of Lee County and many still reside within the county mainly around the Pine Island area.
In 1923, Collier and Hendry Counties were created by splitting these areas from Lee County.
On August 13, 2004, the county was struck by Hurricane Charley, a Category 4 storm, particularly on the northwestern islands of Captiva, Gasparilla and North Captiva.
Geography[edit]
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,212 square miles (3,140Â km2), of which 785 square miles (2,030Â km2) is land and 428 square miles (1,110Â km2) (35.3%) is water.[6] Rivers and streams include the Caloosahatchee River, the Imperial River, the Estero River, Hendry Creek, and Orange River.
Lee County is on the southwest coast of Florida. It is approximately 125 miles (201Â km) south of Tampa and 115 miles (185Â km) west of Fort Lauderdale via Interstate 75; and approximately 125 miles (201Â km) west-northwest of Miami via U.S. Highway 41.

Climate[edit]
Lee County has a year-round warm, monsoon-influenced climate that is close to the boundary between tropical and subtropical climates (18Â Â°C (64Â Â°F) in the coldest month), and is thus either classified as a humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen Cfa), which is the classification used by NOAA,[7][8] or a tropical savanna climate (KÃ¶ppen Aw).[9] Lee County has short, warm winters, and long, hot, humid summers, with most of the year's rainfall falling from June to September. The temperature rarely rises to 100Â Â°F (38Â Â°C) or lowers to the freezing mark.[10] At 89, Lee County leads the nation in the number of days annually in which a thunderstorm is close enough for thunder to be heard.[11] The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 64.2Â Â°F (17.9Â Â°C) in January to 83.4Â Â°F (28.6Â Â°C) in August, with the annual mean being 75.1Â Â°F (23.9Â Â°C). Records range from 24Â Â°F (â4Â Â°C) on December 29, 1894 up to 103Â Â°F (39Â Â°C) on June 16â17, 1981.[10]

Airports[edit]



Southwest Florida International Airport, in South Fort Myers, serves over 8.37 million passengers annually.[31] Currently, the airport offers international non-stop flights to Cancun, Mexico; DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany; Nassau, Bahamas; and Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto in Canada. In addition, nine airlines operate flights to 29 domestic non-stop destinations. On September 9, 2005, the airport opened a new terminal.






Page Field, also in South Fort Myers, just south of the incorporated limits of the City of Fort Myers, is the county's general aviation airport. Prior to the opening of Southwest Florida Regional Airport in 1983 (now Southwest Florida International Airport), Page Field was the county's commercial airport.



Seaports and marine transport[edit]
A small port operation continues in Boca Grande, being used as a way-point for oil distribution. However, Port Boca Grande has been in decline for many years as the shipping industry has moved north, especially to the Port of Tampa.
In addition, a private enterprise operates a high-speed passenger-only ferry service between Fort Myers Beach From San Carlos Island and Key West. Another ferry service is offered from Fort Myers to Key West
Major highways[edit]



Interstate 75
The county's only fully controlled-access freeway, and has ten interchanges within Lee County, linking the area to Naples, Fort Lauderdale and Miami to the south and east; and Sarasota and Tampa to the north. The freeway is at least six lanes throughout Lee County and is up to eight lanes in some areas.

Lee Boulevard
SRÂ 884 is Lee County's main east-west arterial highway. Its western terminus is in the incorporated limits of the City of Cape Coral and the eastern terminus is in Lehigh Acres. Within Cape Coral, the highway is named "Veterans' Memorial Parkway", and is a multi-lane controlled access highway. Within Fort Myers, it is named "Colonial Boulevard". The road crosses the Caloosahatchee River as an elevated highway across a toll bridge, interchanging with U.S. Highway 41 and Interstate 75, then becomes a multi-lane divided surface highway through Lehigh Acres. After it intersects with State Road 82, it is called "Lee Boulevard".

MLB spring training[edit]




Red Sox logo on the fence outside the City of Palms Park


The Boston Red Sox hold their annual spring training at JetBlue Park in the Fort Myers area. A cross-town rivalry has developed with the Minnesota Twins, who conduct their spring training at Hammond Stadium in south Lee County, which has a capacity of 7,500 and opened in 1991.
The Red Sox' lease with Fort Myers runs through 2019, but the Red Sox were considering exercising the early out in their contract that would have allowed them to leave following the 2009 spring season. On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3â1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. The new stadium, named JetBlue Park at Fenway South, is located off Daniels Parkway near Southwest Florida International Airport. The stadium opened in time for the 2012 Spring training season.
City of Palms Park had been built in 1992 for the Red Sox' spring training. Former Red Sox left fielder Mike Greenwell is from Fort Myers, and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for spring training.[citation needed] The deal for JetBlue Park left City of Palms Park without a tenant. County officials have discussed the possibility of securing another team for City of Palms. Terry Park Ballfield (also known as the Park T. Pigott Memorial Stadium) in East Fort Myers is also not currently in use by a Major League Baseball team, though it is the former home of the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals.

Lee County was created in 1887 from Monroe County.[3] It was named for Robert E. Lee, Confederate general in the American Civil War.[4]
Incorporated in 1886, Fort Myers is the center of a popular tourist area in Southwest Florida and the seat of Lee County. It is about 120 miles (190Â km) south of Tampa at the meeting point of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caloosahatchee River. Fort Myers was the frequent winter home of Thomas Edison, as well as Henry Ford.[5] Lee County has been the host to several Major League Baseball teams for Spring Training, over the past several decades. Currently, it is the spring home of the Boston Red Sox, as well as the Minnesota Twins.
Fort Myers, built in 1850 as a military fort to fend off Seminole Indians, was named after Col. Abraham C. Myers, who was stationed in Florida for seven years and was the son-in-law of the fortâs establisher and commander. In 1858, after years of elusive battle, chief Billy Bowlegs and his warriors were persuaded to surrender and move west, and the fort was abandoned. Billyâs Creek, which flows into the Caloosahatchee River, was named after a temporary camp where Billy Bowlegs and his men awaited ships to take them west.
In 1863, the fort was reoccupied by Federal troops during the Civil War. In 1865 the fort was attacked unsuccessfully by a small group of Confederates. After the war, the fort was again deserted.
The first settlers arrived in 1866, but it was not until 1882 when the city experienced a significant influx of settlers. By 1885, when Fort Myers was incorporated, it was the second largest city only to Tampa on Floridaâs west coast south of Cedar Key, even larger than Clearwater and Sarasota, also growing cities at the time.
Fort Myers first became a nationally known winter resort with the building of The Royal Palm Hotel in 1898. But what really sparked the cityâs growth was the construction of the Tamiami Trail Bridge built across the Caloosahatchee River in 1924. After the bridgeâs construction, the city experienced its first real estate boom and many subdivisions sprouted around the city.
In the 1870s, Tervio Padilla, a wealthy merchant from the Canary Islands, came by way of Key West to Cayo Costa and established trade with natives and âranchosâ that extended northward to Charlotte Harbor. His ships often made port at Cayo Costa at the entrance to the harbor. Enchanted by the tropical island, he eventually decided to settle there. Padilla prospered until the outbreak of the SpanishâAmerican War when his fleet was burned and scuttled. He then turned to another means of livelihood â fishing. When the government claimed his land he was disinclined to set up another ranch so moved with his wife further down the island and as before, simply homesteaded . The Padilla family is one of the first pioneer families of Lee County and many still reside within the county mainly around the Pine Island area.
In 1923, Collier and Hendry Counties were created by splitting these areas from Lee County.
On August 13, 2004, the county was struck by Hurricane Charley, a Category 4 storm, particularly on the northwestern islands of Captiva, Gasparilla and North Captiva.
Geography[edit]
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,212 square miles (3,140Â km2), of which 785 square miles (2,030Â km2) is land and 428 square miles (1,110Â km2) (35.3%) is water.[6] Rivers and streams include the Caloosahatchee River, the Imperial River, the Estero River, Hendry Creek, and Orange River.
Lee County is on the southwest coast of Florida. It is approximately 125 miles (201Â km) south of Tampa and 115 miles (185Â km) west of Fort Lauderdale via Interstate 75; and approximately 125 miles (201Â km) west-northwest of Miami via U.S. Highway 41.

Climate[edit]
Lee County has a year-round warm, monsoon-influenced climate that is close to the boundary between tropical and subtropical climates (18Â Â°C (64Â Â°F) in the coldest month), and is thus either classified as a humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen Cfa), which is the classification used by NOAA,[7][8] or a tropical savanna climate (KÃ¶ppen Aw).[9] Lee County has short, warm winters, and long, hot, humid summers, with most of the year's rainfall falling from June to September. The temperature rarely rises to 100Â Â°F (38Â Â°C) or lowers to the freezing mark.[10] At 89, Lee County leads the nation in the number of days annually in which a thunderstorm is close enough for thunder to be heard.[11] The monthly daily average temperature ranges from 64.2Â Â°F (17.9Â Â°C) in January to 83.4Â Â°F (28.6Â Â°C) in August, with the annual mean being 75.1Â Â°F (23.9Â Â°C). Records range from 24Â Â°F (â4Â Â°C) on December 29, 1894 up to 103Â Â°F (39Â Â°C) on June 16â17, 1981.[10]

Seaports and marine transport[edit]
A small port operation continues in Boca Grande, being used as a way-point for oil distribution. However, Port Boca Grande has been in decline for many years as the shipping industry has moved north, especially to the Port of Tampa.
In addition, a private enterprise operates a high-speed passenger-only ferry service between Fort Myers Beach From San Carlos Island and Key West. Another ferry service is offered from Fort Myers to Key West

MLB spring training[edit]




Red Sox logo on the fence outside the City of Palms Park


The Boston Red Sox hold their annual spring training at JetBlue Park in the Fort Myers area. A cross-town rivalry has developed with the Minnesota Twins, who conduct their spring training at Hammond Stadium in south Lee County, which has a capacity of 7,500 and opened in 1991.
The Red Sox' lease with Fort Myers runs through 2019, but the Red Sox were considering exercising the early out in their contract that would have allowed them to leave following the 2009 spring season. On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3â1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. The new stadium, named JetBlue Park at Fenway South, is located off Daniels Parkway near Southwest Florida International Airport. The stadium opened in time for the 2012 Spring training season.
City of Palms Park had been built in 1992 for the Red Sox' spring training. Former Red Sox left fielder Mike Greenwell is from Fort Myers, and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for spring training.[citation needed] The deal for JetBlue Park left City of Palms Park without a tenant. County officials have discussed the possibility of securing another team for City of Palms. Terry Park Ballfield (also known as the Park T. Pigott Memorial Stadium) in East Fort Myers is also not currently in use by a Major League Baseball team, though it is the former home of the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates and Kansas City Royals.

A must for every manâs arsenal: a few reliable pairs of jeans that have a classic look with a modern flair and a great fit. Lee jeans for men provide high-quality pants for anyone looking to add denim durability and unbeatable style to their everyday look. Keep loose and stay comfortable with the freeing forms of relaxed or bootcut jeans. More of a traditionalist? Stick with what you know and look great in a pair of straight or slim fit pants. Take advantage of extra pocket space with a trusty set of carpenter jeans. Too hot for long pants? Get the same quality youâre used to with a bit less length. From cargo shorts to flat-front shortsâand denim to khaki, Lee shorts give you an attractive summer style and a great way to stay cool. Whether youâre shopping for weekday work attire or weekend casual, our Lee jeans and pants will give you a classic look for a lot less.
