Small Cap Growth
Benefitting from DISCOVERY and REDISCOVERY
Profile

Disciplined investment process consistently executed since 1976
Team of 4 portfolio managers and one portfolio advisor with an average of 34 years of experience
Assets under management $2.7 billion
Active portfolio management involvement with client relationships

Philosophy
Our research process uncovers information gaps in small, rapidly growing or misunderstood companies with the potential for dramatic stock price appreciation.
Investment Process
Discovery Phase:
For companies in the early stages of their investment cycle, we require evidence of high growth (future EPS growth greater than 20%). Rapid earnings growth will attract the attention of investors who, in turn, will bid up the stock price to accumulate shares.
Rediscovery Phase:
The majority of the portfolio's Rediscovery companies have re-emerged after a period of difficulty and are characterized by near-term earnings acceleration due to factors such as a change in management, a new product cycle or a cyclical upturn. We also look for companies that have assets that are undervalued. Rediscovery companies must provide a minimum of 40% EPS growth over the next twelve months, or sell at a 40% discount to asset value.
