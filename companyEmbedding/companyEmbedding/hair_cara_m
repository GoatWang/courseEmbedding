Tint Hints

Throw shade in a fun,
										pretty new way with L'Oréal Colorista Semi-Permanent Hair
										Color. These steps — and the 11 no-commitment colors — make it
										easy to test drive the bold-highlights trend.





Step 1: Tease Please 

Start from the bottom
										layers and work up, coloring diagonal sections. To help new
										color blend gradually with your existing shade near roots,
										lightly backcomb a few inches of each section before applying
										dye.





Step 2: The Brush On

Apply color in a V
										shape, which adds dimension, starting just under the teased
										part. Fill in the bottom half of the V then use the tip of the
										brush to feather the color up into the teased part.





Step 3: Premium Blend

Using your fingers this
										time, backcomb again near roots to further diffuse the line
										between new and existing color. Then use your other hand as a
										base while you brush color through to the ends.





Step 4: Crown Rinse

Repeat on additional
										sections. If hair is dark, don't worry about dye transfer; on
										lighter hair, use a foil barrier or pin up sections you aren't
										coloring. After 30 minutes, rinse with lukewarm water.





Step 5: Style-phile

After rinsing, towel
										dry (use a dark one to avoid stains) and style as usual. No
										need to shampoo or condition; the moisturizing formula leaves
										hair soft and shiny.

      Hair Care at Walgreens Take great care of your hair from root to end with Walgreens Hair Care Products. No matter what your hair's characteristics, you can find a variety of daily care and styling products to keep it looking and feeling its best. From shampoos and conditioners to scalp treatments and even hair appliances, Walgreens offers a wide selection of products to help keep your hair healthy and looking beautiful. The Essentials of Daily Hair Care All day long, your hair is exposed to sweat from your scalp and impurities in the environment, which build up on the strands and can leave the hair looking and smelling dirty. Shampooing your hair purifies the strands and scalp, lifting away dirt and oil, so that your hair looks and smells better. The hair that you can see outside of your follicles is made up of cells that are no longer alive. As a result, they do not produce materials to keep the strands in good health. Virtually all of the moisture and nutrients necessary to ensure that the hair stays soft and strong must come from your hair care products, and conditioner is the product designed specifically to provide the hair with nutrition necessary to maintain its beauty. Conditioners contain hydrators and other beneficial ingredients that leave the hair more manageable, softer to the touch and more pliable, so it is less likely to break. The key to creating the perfect daily hair care regimen is to select a shampoo and a conditioner for your specific hair type. The Role of Styling Aids Styling aids are not essential for keeping your hair healthy, but they are often necessary to create great looking hairstyles. Products like mousse, gels, serums, pomade and creams make the hair easier to shape and style, while hairsprays and other styling products add hold to keep the tresses in place once they are styled. Mechanical tools like blow dryers, flat irons, curling irons and hot rollers and handheld tools like brushes and combs are also useful for styling the hair and getting looks that you desire. Hair color products are available at Walgreens to temporarily or permanently alter the hue of your locks or to cover gray growth. Specialty Products for Individual Needs Hair care products come in many different types, and some are formulated with the needs of certain individuals in mind. Men's hair care products are made to be simple to use with formulas and scents geared toward the needs and tastes of guys. Children's products are often extra gentle on the skin and eyes to make washing, conditioning and styling kids' tresses simpler for parents and children alike. Ethnic hair care products are made to meet the unique needs of African-American hair, which has a coarser texture and is more prone to dryness and frizz. Natural and organic products use substances found in nature instead of synthetic chemicals for those with sensitive skin and individuals who are striving to lead greener lives.

Best Hair Care And Beauty Products For Summer
July 28, 2017 12:31 PM


Filed Under: Beauty, deodorant, Dry Shampoo, Hair, Lipstick, Moisturizer, SPF, Summer



 











By Carly Petrone
Just because it’s hot and humid outside doesn’t mean you can’t look your best. From the perfect dry shampoo to a fast acting deodorant, here are five products for the hair, skin and face that will make you feel flirty and fun during those sticky summer months.
Dry Shampoo
Summer is the ideal time to take it easy when it comes to styling and washing your hair. Put down the curling iron and grab a bottle of dry shampoo instead. Several brands now make this in both spray and powder form so all you have to do is shake a little at the root of your hair, tousle and blend it with your fingers and blend in with a brush. Not only will your strands absorb oil but the ends of your hair will be hydrated and you’ll get a boost of volume overall. Many brands may give off a white residue but plenty are also now marketing to blonds, brunettes and redheads. L’ANZA even came up with a Healing Style Dry Shampoo that’s made with a Keratin Cactus Complex to heal hair and boost structural integrity. Other favorites include Philosophy’s Amazing Grace, Batiste Dry Shampoo and Oribe’s Dry Texturizing Spray. Now you don’t have to ever worry about your blow out going limp the next day!

Liquid Lipstick
If you want a lipstick that will last throughout the workday and beyond, look no further than liquid lipstick. Several brands now carry this genius invention that’s a mix between a lip stain and a satiny lip gloss. A few stand outs include Stila’s Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick (Amalfi, Firenze, and Fiore are some of our favorite shades), Tarte’s Tarteist Quick Dry Matte Lip Paint (Birthday Suit is the perfect nude), and Bobbi Brown’s Art Stick Liquid Lip (get noticed in Pink Punch or Azalea). If you’re looking for a drugstore buy, our go-to is definitely NYX Lip Lingerie (it’ll cost you $8 at the most). This is a must-have item for those hot and humid days because you know the color will stick to your lips without having to reapply throughout the day.

UVA/UVB Sun Protectant Sprays & Lotions
We all know the sun can be extra harsh on your skin during the hot summer months. But what about your hair and scalp? Many hair care lines are now tailoring their products to protect your head from harsh UVA rays. One of Bumble & Bumble’s top sellers is their Hairdresser’s Invisible Oil UV Protective Dry Oil Finish Spray, which gives hair subtle shine and softness. Dry Bar’s cult following continues with their ever-popular Hot Toddy Heat & UV Protectant – a lightweight lotion that protects hair from heat and UVA/UVB exposure – while Not Your Mother’s Beat The Heat Thermal Styling Shield Spray conditions with natural sunflower and vitamin A+E and keeps hair from scorching before styling with a blow dryer, flat iron, or curling iron (it also blocks daily UV rays). So get out there and enjoy the sun without having to worry about damaging your hair.

Moisturizers & Face Lotions with SPF
You may remember to lather up with SPF when you hit the beach but what about for your everyday walk around the city? Keep your face protected by using a moisturizer or face lotion with SPF already in the bottle. Today’s formulas aren’t sticky and most are thin enough to layer below your foundation or tinted moisturizer. One great drugstore buy is Australian Gold’s Botanical Sunscreen Mineral Lotions – choose from SPF 30 or SPF 50. This non-greasy and chemical free lotion is made with eucalyptus to help calm and reinvigorate your skin (plus it’s filled with antioxidants). It also comes in a fun tinted formula so you can rock a bit of a tanned glow. Other favorites include Kiehls’ Facial Fuel SPF 15 and Ultra Facial Moisturizer SPF 30, Kate Somerville Daily Deflector Moisturizer (SPF 50!), and Perricone MD’s Photo Plasma Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30.

Chemical-Free Deodorant
Okay, let’s get real. We all sweat when we hit the streets and subway stations during the hot and sticky summer months. So how do we stay fresh and comfortable? By using an effective and protecting deodorant! JASÖN makes a Dry Spray Deodorant that’s free of harsh chemicals and irritants, plus they don’t leave any residue on your skin or clothing. Another good one is Botanica Clear Enzyme Lavender Deodorant by Alba. This nontoxic deodorant is a favorite of Jessica Alba because it’s hypo-allergenic and the antibacterial properties of lavender and lichen work together as nature’s odor-deterrents (plus the addition of aloe vera soothes sensitive skin).

To have and maintain a healthy head of hair, there are many products available to help you accomplish just that. shampoos, conditioners, styling and cutting tools, hair brushes and much more all might become part of your daily ritual to keep your hair looking good. With low prices, every day, on everything, you can get the hair care supplies you need for less. Here's how to figure out what you need.ShampoosNo matter what type of hair you have, there's a shampoo just for you. There are shampoos specific to men's, women's and children's hair. Other hair conditions that shampoo can improve include dandruff, oily hair or frizzy hair. If you have dry or damaged hair, there are hydrating shampoos that can reverse the damage. Fine, thin hair is easy to protect and improve through the use of shampoos designed to add volume and texture. For simplicity, there are also shampoos and conditioners combined into one product.ConditionersConditioners help maintain various types of hair as well. If you have color-treated hair, it helps to use a conditioner that maintains the color and retains the treatment longer. All types of hair can benefit from the proper conditioner, including curly, frizzy, thick, long, straight, dry, oily and fine hair. Some conditioners are those that you massage into your hair, then rinse out immediately. Some, you massage in and leave in for a few minutes. There are even some conditioners that require you to leave them in overnight, especially if you have damaged or heat-styled hair.Hair coloring productsWhen choosing hair coloring products, the two most common reasons are to change the color of your hair or to address a specific issue, such as creating highlights in your hair or covering up some gray hair. Although hair coloring can be gender- and age-specific, most people can use any type of hair coloring. Some hair coloring products are extremely simple to use and just require you to brush the color in or even lather the color, much like you'd with shampoo. When coloring your hair, the time involved is directly related to how much you're changing the color. If you're just changing your shade slightly, the time involved is minimal. However, if you're going dark brown to light blonde, for example, there are several steps involved and a great deal of time involved. There are also temporary hair colors you can add in, representing many assorted colors   including those not normally found on hair   that naturally wash out after several showers.Styling productsProbably no tool is more important when it comes to styling hair than the hair dryer. These powerful devices allow you to both blow dry your hair and style it at the same time. hair dryers reduce the amount of time it takes to dry your hair by a great deal. Hair dryers are available by the amount of wattage they use and what type of accessories they have. Many hair dryers run on 1,875 watts but can have fewer than 1,000 watts and more than 2,000 watts. If you use curlers or prefer that salon-like feeling while at home, there are also bonnet-style hair dryers that cover your head completely.A couple of other key styling tools for hair are curling irons and flat irons. Although they work much the same way, one makes small or large curls, and the other one flattens and straightens hair   both with heat. Both types of irons are available in varied sizes, with most being between 3/4 of an inch to 2 inches wide. Larger sizes work best on thicker hair.Other hair care productsAll of the styling you want to do with your hair is much easier with a good hair brush or comb to remove tangles and smooth things out. Some common types include natural, synthetic and mixed bristle brushes that are either paddle, vented, round, teasing or wet brushes. Bristle brushes are good for using with long hair, and synthetic or mixed bristle brushes don't create as much static as natural bristle brushes. Natural bristle brushes are soft and help spread your hair's natural oils throughout your hair, making it look shiny.Paddle brushes are flat and wide and work well when doing a blowout on your hair. Vented brushes, with their increased airflow, help cut down drying time even more. Round brushes also work well when doing a blowout and help create extra volume. Teasing brushes allow you to tease the ends of your hair in different styles for more volume. Rattail combs make it easier for you to section hair for braids and other styles. Wide-tooth combs are easier on your hair when it's wet and reduce breakage.For holding hair in place, you can use barrettes, French combs, claw clips, snap clips, headbands, bobby pins or elastic bands. These allow you to hold your hair in different styles, such as ponytails, pigtails, updos and French twists.Show moreElectrode, Comp-147349563, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-

10 Hair Products for Thicker Hair


July 26, 2017July 26, 2017
Hair, Shampoo/Conditioner
by Chanchala Bose








 




 




 




Hi IMBBians, 
There is a set of hair care products that you need in your daily life in order to make your hair healthier and thicker. Let’s have a look at some of the best hair products for thicker hair.








Matrix Opti Care Smoothing Conditioner

Thick hair is mostly unmanageable. Thus, you need a smoothening effect the most. When your thick hair is well polished it will look great. And, this is what this conditioner from Matrix does. It is enriched with shea butter, which helps in conditioning and managing your hair. It gives a beautiful shine to your hair and makes it thicker. 




L’Oreal Professionnel X-Tenso Care Nutri-Reconstructor Shampoo
This professional shampoo from the house of L’Oreal is known to keep excess oil at bay. Thick hair suffers the issue of excessive oil and dirt, thus your scalp is more prone to infections. The botanical extracts and amino acids in this shampoo cleanse your hair well and infuse new life into it. 
Organix Renewing Moroccan Argan Oil Conditioner

Best Hair Care And Beauty Products For Summer
July 28, 2017 12:31 PM


Filed Under: Beauty, deodorant, Dry Shampoo, Hair, Lipstick, Moisturizer, SPF, Summer



 











By Carly Petrone
Just because it’s hot and humid outside doesn’t mean you can’t look your best. From the perfect dry shampoo to a fast acting deodorant, here are five products for the hair, skin and face that will make you feel flirty and fun during those sticky summer months.
Dry Shampoo
Summer is the ideal time to take it easy when it comes to styling and washing your hair. Put down the curling iron and grab a bottle of dry shampoo instead. Several brands now make this in both spray and powder form so all you have to do is shake a little at the root of your hair, tousle and blend it with your fingers and blend in with a brush. Not only will your strands absorb oil but the ends of your hair will be hydrated and you’ll get a boost of volume overall. Many brands may give off a white residue but plenty are also now marketing to blonds, brunettes and redheads. L’ANZA even came up with a Healing Style Dry Shampoo that’s made with a Keratin Cactus Complex to heal hair and boost structural integrity. Other favorites include Philosophy’s Amazing Grace, Batiste Dry Shampoo and Oribe’s Dry Texturizing Spray. Now you don’t have to ever worry about your blow out going limp the next day!

Liquid Lipstick
If you want a lipstick that will last throughout the workday and beyond, look no further than liquid lipstick. Several brands now carry this genius invention that’s a mix between a lip stain and a satiny lip gloss. A few stand outs include Stila’s Stay All Day Liquid Lipstick (Amalfi, Firenze, and Fiore are some of our favorite shades), Tarte’s Tarteist Quick Dry Matte Lip Paint (Birthday Suit is the perfect nude), and Bobbi Brown’s Art Stick Liquid Lip (get noticed in Pink Punch or Azalea). If you’re looking for a drugstore buy, our go-to is definitely NYX Lip Lingerie (it’ll cost you $8 at the most). This is a must-have item for those hot and humid days because you know the color will stick to your lips without having to reapply throughout the day.

UVA/UVB Sun Protectant Sprays & Lotions
We all know the sun can be extra harsh on your skin during the hot summer months. But what about your hair and scalp? Many hair care lines are now tailoring their products to protect your head from harsh UVA rays. One of Bumble & Bumble’s top sellers is their Hairdresser’s Invisible Oil UV Protective Dry Oil Finish Spray, which gives hair subtle shine and softness. Dry Bar’s cult following continues with their ever-popular Hot Toddy Heat & UV Protectant – a lightweight lotion that protects hair from heat and UVA/UVB exposure – while Not Your Mother’s Beat The Heat Thermal Styling Shield Spray conditions with natural sunflower and vitamin A+E and keeps hair from scorching before styling with a blow dryer, flat iron, or curling iron (it also blocks daily UV rays). So get out there and enjoy the sun without having to worry about damaging your hair.

Moisturizers & Face Lotions with SPF
You may remember to lather up with SPF when you hit the beach but what about for your everyday walk around the city? Keep your face protected by using a moisturizer or face lotion with SPF already in the bottle. Today’s formulas aren’t sticky and most are thin enough to layer below your foundation or tinted moisturizer. One great drugstore buy is Australian Gold’s Botanical Sunscreen Mineral Lotions – choose from SPF 30 or SPF 50. This non-greasy and chemical free lotion is made with eucalyptus to help calm and reinvigorate your skin (plus it’s filled with antioxidants). It also comes in a fun tinted formula so you can rock a bit of a tanned glow. Other favorites include Kiehls’ Facial Fuel SPF 15 and Ultra Facial Moisturizer SPF 30, Kate Somerville Daily Deflector Moisturizer (SPF 50!), and Perricone MD’s Photo Plasma Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30.

Chemical-Free Deodorant
Okay, let’s get real. We all sweat when we hit the streets and subway stations during the hot and sticky summer months. So how do we stay fresh and comfortable? By using an effective and protecting deodorant! JASÖN makes a Dry Spray Deodorant that’s free of harsh chemicals and irritants, plus they don’t leave any residue on your skin or clothing. Another good one is Botanica Clear Enzyme Lavender Deodorant by Alba. This nontoxic deodorant is a favorite of Jessica Alba because it’s hypo-allergenic and the antibacterial properties of lavender and lichen work together as nature’s odor-deterrents (plus the addition of aloe vera soothes sensitive skin).

Excellent for me and my kids
January 25, 2014


			Great moisturizer for my relaxed hair as well as my girls' natural hair. I use a little at night before wrapping my hair. This gives me just the right amount if moisture and shine without weighing my hair down.

Moisturizing but not heavy
December 8, 2013


			After trying many hairdressing creams I have returned to this one. It moisturizes while letting your hair retain its body and movement. I apply it nightly paying particular attention to the ends then I seal with a small amount of coconut or argan oil. It keeps my hair healthy and supple.

"Love it!"
November 2, 2013


			I love this product!. It is a great moisturing creme that does not weigh my hair down!
I have naturally wavy, curly hair and it gives my hair a moisturized, conditioned shine that holds all day.
When my neighborhood store stopped selling it, I looked online and I am so glad that SleekHair carries it.

A must have for natural hair!
October 18, 2013


			This is a wonderful product. It's a light cream that keeps my natural hair very moisturized. I add it to the ends of my hair to hydrate it and keep it from feeling dry. This product gives my hair great shine without it looking or feeling oily. Only a little bit is needed for this to work. It also has a very nice smell.
			
			
		
Pros:Great hydration. moisture, and shine product!
Cons:Some say it is pricey, but I think you get what you pay for.

This stuff is the bomb!
May 12, 2013


			This stuff is the bomb! I love it: my hair loves it. I bought it at Ulta and it is amazing. My hair looks hydrated and bone straight. I love this product. My hair is fine and it is hard to find something light enough to be effective and keep it hydrated. I love this stuff. It last several days and is worth every penny.

I love this product
August 24, 2012


			I love this product. What I also do is purchase liquid vitamin E and add that to the containter.  It moisten my scalp and leaves my permed hair feeling silky.  I usually oil my scalp and place my bonnet over it so that it saturates into my scalp and hair.  I don't do this before I go out because I don't want others to see this white stuff on my scalp. Great price and last a long time.

Not long lasting hydration
August 12, 2012


			I have very dry chemically straightened hair and Keracare conditioning creme did not really keep my hair hydrated through out the day. It did seem to reduce hair breakage.

 A little dab will do
October 25, 2011


			This hairdress makes my relaxed hair shiny and soft, however only a tiny amount is needed, too much made it very stiff, so I learned my lesson there. A 4 oz size should last quite some time, and the scent is mild and pleasant.
			
			
		
Pros:Makes hair shiny and soft
Cons:a bit pricey, but will last a long time

Smells great!

			It's very creamy, not sure I'd consider it light as some people do. When using, less is better. It works well as a moisturizer.  I love it!

Review for KeraCare Conditioning Creme Hairdress
July 17, 2009


			This is a wonderful product.
It's a light cream that keeps my hair very moisturized.
If my hair feels dry, I normally add a tiny amount of avocado oil.
I've started to use this instead.
This gives great shine to my hair without it looking or feeling oily.
I only need to use a tiny bit for this to work. I think little tub will last a year. It also smells very nice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
