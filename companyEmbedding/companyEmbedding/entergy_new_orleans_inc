Back to Top

A. Most customers with a valid utility account can enroll. New customers may enroll after receiving an account number. The ZIP code from your service location will also be needed.

Back to Top


Q. What do l need to enroll?

A. You will need your account number and the service location ZIP code from your bill.





 


 

Back to Top


Q. What are my options for payment once I've signed up for myAccount?


Online Payment Options:


Pay One Time Using Your Bank Account (free)
Sign up for monthly Automated Bank Draft (free)
Pay by credit card or debit card using Bill Matrix ($2.95 fee), a third party service.


Pay One Time Using Your Bank Account (free)

myAccount allows you to pay your bill online using your checking account. You will be asked for routing number and account number for each bank account you enroll. You can make single payments to be posted immediately or schedule a payment prior to or on the due date for your current utility bill.





 


 

Sign up for monthly Automatic Bank Draft (free)

You may also sign up online for a recurring payment to be made using your bank account that will post each month on the due date for your utility bill.

Pay By Credit Card or Debit Card Using Third Party Bill Matrix ($2.95 fee)

From myAccount, we provide a link to the website of Bill Matrix Corporation for payment of your current utility bill by credit or debit card.

Other Entergy Payment Options

If you enroll in myAccount to view your utility bills and manage account information, you may still pay your bill through one of the other payment channels shown below:

Mail-in
Automatic Bank Draft
Quick Payment Centers (QPC)
Pay by Phone
CheckFree


Pay by Mail

It’s fast, easy, and one stamp is all it takes for your payment to reach us. Please include your account information on your check or money order to help facilitate timely posting. You can find our mailing addresses by simply going to the Entergy.com home page, choosing your state, and selecting Payment Options. You will see the address to use for mailing your payment.

Pay by Automatic Bank Draft

If you are currently enrolled in Automatic Bank Draft program, you can still receive your utility bill online, and we will continue to debit your account each month on the due date of your current utility bill.

Quick Payment Centers (walk-in locations)

Even if you are registered for myAccount, you can still take your payment to a Quick Payment Center. You will need to print a copy of your bill, including the stub, and bring it with you. Remember, if you make a payment at both a walk-in site and on myAccount, both payments will be processed.

Pay by Phone

In partnership with our vendor, Bill Matrix, Entergy offers a Pay-by-Phone option for residential and small business customers. You can pay your bill over the phone using a credit card, debit card, or checking account. This service is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This payment option can be used by calling BillMatrix at 1-800-584-1241.

Paying by Checkfree

Customers who register on myAccount can also continue to view and pay their utility bills online at CheckFree. However, if you wish to receive your billing statement by email, you must first dis-enroll from the CheckFree service. Please remember that if you make a payment on both CheckFree and myAccount, both payments will be processed.

Back to Top


Q. Who is eligible for myAccount Payment by bank account?

A. Customers who:

have either a Checking or Savings account with a bank or a credit union
have had no more than one utility bill payment fail due to insufficient funds during the prior 12 months
are not currently enrolled in the Collective Bill program, which allows customers with multiple Entergy accounts to receive fewer monthly statements (or, in some cases, a single monthly statement).


Back to Top


Q. What is Levelized Billing?

A. Levelized Billing allows customers to pay approximately the same amount for electric service every month. For example, they pay a lower amount than their actual bill amount during the high-bill summer months, but are required to make it up with higher payments during the low-bill winter months. This creates manageable bills regardless of temperature, volatility of our fuel cost, and usage. Under this program, bills are essentially an average of the customer’s monthly utility costs over a 12-month period. Bills will vary slightly each month. The benefit of Levelized Billing is that fluctuations in bill amounts are averaged out over the year.

Back to Top


Q. What is Equal Pay?


Equal Pay

Similar to Levelized Billing, this option allows customers to pay the same amount for electric service every month with an adjustment to this amount every thirteenth month based on the previous twelve months’ actual bills. Equal Pay allows customers to easily budget their electric and gas bills, only having to make adjustments once a year in most cases.

Eligibility requirements


All customers except for those located in Entergy New Orleans’ service area
Electric/gas residential and church/synagogue accounts with 12 consecutive months of service
Electric/gas combination accounts with 12 consecutive months of service
Account must have no balance due
Any customer using Equal Pay who has dis-enrolled my not re-enroll for six months
Not available for accounts participating in the Collective Bill program


Back to Top


Q. What about late payments and extended due dates?

A. If you are unable to pay your bill on time, please call us at 1-800-ENTERGY (800-368-3749). The same late payment charges and extended due date policies apply to all payment types, regardless of the bill delivery method.

Back to Top

Back to Top


Q. Can I pay an amount other than the total amount due?

A. . Yes. You are responsible to pay all charges on your account when they are due. You can use the “Other” option to pay an amount other than the total amount due.

A. The answer depends on how your payment is made:

Entergy New Orleans, Inc.

New Orleans, Louisiana

Partner of the Year


Energy Efficiency Program Delivery



Entergy New Orleans, Inc., a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, is an electric and gas utility serving Orleans Parish. Regulated by the New Orleans City Council, Entergy New Orleans serves approximately 197,000 electric customers. In 2009, the Energy Smart energy efficiency program was kicked off with the help of New Orleans City Council. Since that time, Energy Smart has evolved to include two Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® (HPwES) programs, including the Assisted Home Performance with ENERGY STAR (AHPwES) program which serves low-moderate income (LMI) households. Entergy New Orleans is receiving ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year recognition for its regional leadership in energy efficiency and its ongoing support of HPwES. Key 2015 accomplishments include:

Training dozens of contractors who have processed nearly $1.6 million worth of incentives for clients, with an overall economic impact of $2.38 million. Overall, program activities have resulted in the reduction of more than 3,800 metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to the annual energy use of 353 homes for a year.
Using the ENERGY STAR brand to rebuild the trust between homeowners and contractors that was damaged after Hurricane Katrina.
Weatherizing 245 LMI homes and providing more than $560,000 worth of incentives at no cost to the homeowners through the HPwES program.
Providing up to $500 per home for repairs that might be needed prior to the installation of the energy efficiency measures.
Developing a Memorandum of Understanding for referral agencies to leverage outreach of groups already working within the low-income sector, including organizations like Project Homecoming, Rebuilding Together, Council on Aging, and the Lower 9th Ward Neighborhood Empowerment Network Association.
Maintaining a successful HPwES program by completing 845 projects in 2015.
