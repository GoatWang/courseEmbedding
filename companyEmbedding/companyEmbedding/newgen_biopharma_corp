	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS



	 



	This Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Reference is made in particular to the description of our plans and objectives for future operations, assumptions underlying such plans and objectives, and other forward-looking statements included in this report. Such statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,” “expect,” “believe,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “continue,” or similar terms, variations of such terms or the negative of such terms. Such statements are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Such statements address future events and conditions concerning, among others, capital expenditures, earnings, litigation, regulatory matters, liquidity and capital resources, and accounting matters. Actual results in each case could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements by reason of factors such as future economic conditions, changes in consumer demand, legislative, regulatory and competitive developments in markets in which we operate, results of litigation, and other circumstances affecting anticipated revenues and costs, and the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on January 25, 2017.



	 



	As used in this Form 10-Q, “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to NewGen BioPharma Corp., which is also sometimes referred to as the “Company” or “NewGen.”



	 



	YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD LOOKING




	STATEMENTS



	 



	The forward-looking statements made in this report on Form 10-Q relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made in this report on Form 10-Q. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should read this report and the documents that we reference in this report, including documents referenced by incorporation, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect or hope.

	NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	JANUARY 31, 2017




	(UNAUDITED)



	 



	NOTE 1 – NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND CONTINUANCE OF BUSINESS



	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim condensed financial statements of NewGen BioPharma Corp. (formerly Greenwind NRG Inc.) have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted from these statements pursuant to such rules and regulations and, accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes necessary for comprehensive financial statements and should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2016, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2016.


	 


	The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 25, 2010 as Greenwind NRG Inc. The Company planned to engage in the business of off the grid wind power systems for residential, cabin, RV, boat and shop use. In October 2016, the Company effected a name change to NewGen BioPharma Corp. with the intention of completing a reverse merger transaction with NewGen BioPharma Corporation, a New Jersey corporation, and change its business operations to become a pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes enhanced pharmaceuticals and cosmaceuticals through reformulating approved active pharmaceutical ingredients using proprietary nanotechnology platforms. As of the issuance date of the financial statements, the proposed reverse merger transaction has not been completed.


	 


	Effective September 19, 2016, the Company effected a 4 for 1 forward stock split increasing the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 11,900,000 shares to 47,600,000 shares. The accompanying financial statements retroactively reflect this forward stock split.


	 


	These financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at January 31, 2017, the Company has not recognized significant revenue, has a working capital deficit of $28,646, and has an accumulated deficit of $344,023. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, and generating profitable operations from the Company’s future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.


	 



	NOTE 2 – AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER WITH NEWGEN BIOPHARMA CORPORATION (NEW JERSEY)



	 


	On October 27, 2016, the Company entered into a Binding Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of NewGen BioPharma Corporation (New Jersey) (“NewGen New Jersey”). On January 11, 2017, the Company entered into a more definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Company, NewGen Merger Sub Inc., and NewGen New Jersey (the “Agreement”). Among other things, the LOI and the Agreement provide for (1) the Company’s acquisition of NewGen New Jersey for 40,000,000 shares of Company common stock (to represent approximately 80% of the issued and outstanding shares of Company common stock after the transaction) (the “Merger”), (2) a private placement of Company Units of common stock and warrants of up to 2,000,000 Units at $1.00 per Unit or $2,000,000 in proceeds, with $400,000 payable to NewGen New Jersey upon the closing of the Merger and $500,000 per quarter payable to NewGen New Jersey for the next 3 quarters thereafter (in the three months ended January 31, 2017, the Company sold a total of 250,000 Units to 2 investors, the 2 investors each wired $100,000 directly to NewGen New Jersey, and one of the investors wired $50,000 directly to the Company’s law firm in satisfaction of accounts payable to the law firm), and (3) the Company to have no more than $1,000 in liabilities at the closing of the Merger. The Agreement also provides that any party has the right to terminate the Agreement if the closing date has not occurred on or before January 31, 2017. The Agreement also contains conditions precedent to closing, such as the Company’s receipt of the audited, unaudited and proforma financial statements of NewGen New Jersey required to be included in the Super Form 8-K.

	(UNAUDITED)



	 



	NOTE 3 – LOANS RECEIVABLE FROM NEWGEN BIOPHARMA CORPORATION (NEW JERSEY)



	 


	Pursuant to the LOI and the Agreement discussed in Note 2 above, two subscribers to our private placement each wired $100,000 directly to NewGen New Jersey on November 22, 2016 and January 13, 2017 (see Note 6). These loans, which are due the Company from NewGen New Jersey, are unsecured and bear interest at 5% per annum. If the closing of the Merger does not occur, the loans are due and payable upon the earlier of (i) receipt by NewGen New Jersey of proceeds from a financing in an amount not less than $1,000,000, (ii) an Event of Default, or (iii) a change in control of NewGen New Jersey. If the closing of the Merger occurs, the notes will be cancelled as intercompany loans in connection with the transaction. As of January 31, 2017, accrued interest of $1,356 (October 31, 2016 - $0) has been recorded in interest receivable.

	Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.




	 



	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Forward-looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates, forecasts, and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us, or on our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.



	 


	OVERVIEW


	 


	We were incorporated under the name Greenwind NRG Inc. in the State of Nevada on February 25, 2010. Our Articles of Incorporation initially authorized us to issue up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share. On September 19, 2016, we effected a 4-for-1 forward stock split of all our issued and outstanding common stock, which increased the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock from 11,900,000 to 47,600,000. On November 18, 2016, upon approval by our Board of Directors and majority stockholders, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation with the Nevada Secretary of State increasing the number of authorized shares of common stock from 75,000,000 shares to 300,000,000 shares. In connection with the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation, our Board of Directors and majority stockholders also approved and adopted the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company on November 16, 2016. Effective November 18, 2016, we changed the name of our Company from Greenwind NRG Inc. to NewGen BioPharma Corp.


	 


	We are a development-stage company. We have generated no revenues to date and have incurred losses since inception. Our limited operations to date have consisted of the formation of the Company, the raising of capital, maintaining our public company reporting requirements. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that our auditors believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months because we have not generated any revenues to date, and no revenues are anticipated until we implement our business plan.


	 


	To date, we have been unable to raise sufficient funds to fully implement our operations, and we do not believe that we currently have sufficient resources to do so without additional funding. As a result of the current difficult economic environment and our lack of funding to implement our business plan, our Board of Directors began to analyze strategic alternatives available to our Company to continue as a going concern. Such alternatives include raising additional debt or equity financing or consummating a merger or acquisition with a partner that may involve a change in our business plan.


	 


	Although our Board of Directors’ preference would be to obtain additional funding to implement our business plan, the Board believes that it must consider all viable strategic alternatives that are in the best interests of our shareholders. Such strategic alternatives include a merger, acquisition, share exchange, asset purchase, or similar transaction in which our present management will no longer be in control of our Company and our business operations will be replaced by that of our transaction partner. We believe we would be an attractive candidate for such a business combination due to the perceived benefits of being a publicly registered company, thereby providing a transaction partner access to the public marketplace to raise capital. Any such business combination and the selection of a partner for such a business combination involves certain risks, including analyzing and selecting a compatible business partner that is able to engage in a transaction with us and that has business operations which are or will likely prove to be profitable. If we are unable to locate a suitable partner for a business combination, and are otherwise unable to raise additional funding, we will likely be forced to cease business operations.


	 


	On October 27, 2016, we entered into a Binding Letter of Intent (the “LOI”) with NewGen BioPharma Corporation, a New Jersey corporation (“NewGen New Jersey”), in connection with a proposed reverse acquisition transaction between the Company and NewGen New Jersey, whereby the Company and NewGen New Jersey will enter into a reverse triangular merger (the “Merger”). NewGen New Jersey operates as a pharmaceutical company that develops and commercializes enhanced pharmaceuticals and cosmaceuticals through reformulating approved active pharmaceutical ingredients using proprietary nanotechnology platforms. NewGen New Jersey’s platforms and formulations are developed to create improvements in bioavailability, safety, efficacy, dosage reductions, and elimination of fed-fast variability.


	 


	Pursuant to the LOI, we made an advance in the amount of $100,000 to NewGen New Jersey under the terms of a promissory note issued on October 27, 2016. If the closing of the Merger does not occur, the principal amount of the LOI advance, together with accrued interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum, shall become due and payable upon the earlier of (i) receipt by NewGen New Jersey of proceeds from a financing in an amount not less than $1,000,000, (ii) an event of default, or (iii) a change in control of NewGen New Jersey. If the closing of the Merger occurs, the promissory note shall be cancelled as an intercompany loan in connection with the transaction.

	Table of Contents






	 


	In accordance with the terms of the LOI, on January 10, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with NewGen New Jersey and NewGen Merger Sub Inc., a New Jersey corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into NewGen New Jersey, with NewGen New Jersey being the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.


	 


	As set forth in the Merger Agreement, we will acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of NewGen New Jersey in exchange for the issuance to the current holders thereof of 40,000,000 shares of our common stock. Immediately following the closing date, there will be no more than 52,000,000 shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, which shall consist of (i) 10,000,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing date, (ii) an aggregate of 40,000,000 shares of common stock issued to the current stockholders of NewGen New Jersey as provided in the Merger Agreement, and (iii) 2,000,000 shares of common stock which may be issued and outstanding pursuant to a private placement by the Company (as described in further detail below), and excluding any shares of common stock issuable under outstanding warrants and options.


	 


	The Merger is expected to be completed after the closing conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement have either been satisfied or waived by the appropriate party or parties thereto. The Merger Agreement contains certain closing conditions typically found in an agreement of such nature, and the closing of the Merger is conditioned upon the approval by the stockholders of NewGen New Jersey. If we are able to close the Merger transaction as contemplated by the Merger Agreement, NewGen New Jersey will become our wholly-owned subsidiary, and we will report such event on a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC.


	 


	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS


	 



	Comparison of Three Months Ended January 31, 2017 and 2016



	 


	We are still in our initial development stage and have generated no revenues to date.


	 


	During the three month period ended January 31, 2017, the Company incurred $154,826 in operating expenses, compared to $11,288 in operating expenses during the three month period January 31, 2016. The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to an increase in professional fees incurred, including legal fees relating to the negotiation and execution of the Merger Agreement and compliance with regulatory reporting requirements associated therewith.


	 


	The Company incurred a net loss of $153,470 during the three month period ended January 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $11,288 for the three month period ended January 31, 2016. The increase in net loss was due to the increase in operating expenses described above.


	 


	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


	 



	Balance Sheets



	 


	As of January 31, 2017, the Company had $0 in cash and total assets of $201,356, compared to $0 in cash and $0 in total assets as of October 31, 2016. The increase in total assets was due to a loan receivable issued to NewGen New Jersey in connection with the pending Merger.


	 


	As of January 31, 2017, the Company had total liabilities of $230,002, compared to total liabilities of $125,176 as of October 31, 2016. The increase in total liabilities was due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, as the Company had limited cash flows to repay outstanding obligations as they became due, and an increase in the amounts owing to a related party for loans received to support the Company’s day-to-day activities and working capital purposes.


	 



	Financing Arrangements



	 


	On March 14, 2013, a Registration Statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC, registering a total of 10,000,000 shares of our common stock (the “Registered Shares”) in an initial public offering. As of October 31, 2013, the Company issued 2,900,000 Registered Shares for a total of $29,000 in proceeds and the offering was completed.


	 


	In connection with the Merger Agreement, we are obligated to conduct an offering of up to $2,000,000 in Units at a price of $1.00 per Unit, with each “Unit” consisting of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share, exercisable over a 12-month period (the “Offering”). The proceeds of the Offering will be used to fund the ongoing business and operations of NewGen New Jersey following the closing of the Merger.


	 


	During the three month period ended January 31, 2017, we entered into securities purchase agreements and sold 250,000 Units pursuant to the Offering, for aggregate proceeds of $250,000.

	Table of Contents






	 


	Subsequent to our fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2017, on February 15, 2017, we entered into a securities purchase agreement and sold 50,000 Units pursuant to the Offering, for aggregate proceeds of $50,000.


	 


	We currently do not have sufficient working capital to enable us to carry out our stated plan of operation for the next twelve months. We plan to complete private placement sales of our common stock in order to raise the funds necessary to pursue our plan of operation and to fund our working capital deficit in order to enable us to pay our accounts payable and accrued liabilities.


	 


	Any future sale of additional equity and debt securities will result in dilution to current stockholders. We may also seek additional loans where the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could require the Company to agree to operating and financial covenants that would restrict our operations. Financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure by us to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us, or at all, could limit our ability to expand business operations and could harm our overall business prospects.


	 



	Cash Flows from Operating Activities



	 


	During the three month period ended January 31, 2017, the Company used $11,076 in cash for operating activities, compared to $10,582 in cash used for operating activities during the three month period ended January 31, 2016. The slight increase in the cash used for operating activities was attributed to the fact that the Company had to pay more accounts payables that were coming due for outstanding operating activities.


	 



	Cash Flows from Investing Activities



	 


	During the three month periods ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company used $0 in cash for investing activities. In connection with the Merger Agreement, the Company made advances in the amount of $200,000 to NewGen New Jersey from the sale of 200,000 Units pursuant to the Offering. The proceeds of such sales were wired directly to NewGen New Jersey from two investors.


	 



	Cash Flows from Financing Activities



	 


	During the three month period ended January 31, 2017, the Company received $11,076 from financing activities, compared to its receipt of $10,582 from financing activities during the three month period ended January 31, 2016. The proceeds received from financing activities were funds provided by our former sole director and principal executive officer to support the Company’s day-to-day activities.


	 


	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS


	 


	We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders.



	 






	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.




	 


	As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.





	 






	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.




	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures





	 


	Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

	Table of Contents






	 


	Our management, with the participation and under the supervision of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) of the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 31, 2017 in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms.


	 


	Our management team will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and is committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.


	 


	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.


	 



	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 


	There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ending January 31, 2017 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

	Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.




	 


	During the three month period ended January 31, 2017, we entered into securities purchase agreements with foreign institutional investors and sold 250,000 Units of our securities at a price of $1.00 per Unit, for aggregate proceeds of $250,000. Each Unit is comprised of one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share, exercisable over a 12-month period. The proceeds of the sales were used as advances to NewGen New Jersey for working capital and transaction expenses ($200,000) and payment to the Company’s legal counsel in satisfaction of accounts payable ($50,000). The sale and issuance was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Securities Act”) pursuant to the exemption for offshore transactions, as defined in Rule 902 under Regulation S, or the exemption for transactions by an issuer not involved in any public offering under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D, based upon representations made to the Company by such investors.

	Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Investor

	.


	 


	5.1 The Investor represents and warrants to, and covenants with, the Company that: (i) the Investor is an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act and that the Investor is knowledgeable, sophisticated and experienced in making, and is qualified to make decisions with respect to investments in shares presenting an investment decision like that involved in the purchase of the Units, including investments in securities issued by the Company and investments in comparable companies, and has requested, received, reviewed and considered all information it deemed relevant in making an informed decision to purchase the Units; (ii) the Investor has carefully read and fully understands the risks involved with an investment in the Company including, without limitation, the risks identified on

	Annex II

	, attached hereto, (iii) the Investor is acquiring the number of Units set forth in Section 3 of the Signature Page to the Securities Purchase Agreement in the ordinary course of its business and for its own account for investment only and with no present intention of distributing any of such Units or any arrangement or understanding with any other persons regarding the distribution of such Units; (iv) the Investor will not, directly or indirectly, offer, sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise dispose of (or solicit any offers to buy, purchase or otherwise acquire or take a pledge of) any of the Units except in compliance with the Securities Act, applicable state securities laws and the respective rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; (v) all of the representations made by the Investor are true, correct and complete as of the date hereof and will be true, correct and complete as of the Closing Date; and (vi) the Investor has, in connection with its decision to purchase the number of Units set forth in Section 3 of the Signature Page to the Securities Purchase Agreement, relied only upon the Exchange Act Documents and the representations and warranties of the Company contained herein. There are no suits, pending litigation, or claims against the undersigned that could materially affect the net worth of the Investor.


	 


	5.2 The Investor acknowledges that it has had access to the Exchange Act Documents and has carefully reviewed the same. The Investor further acknowledges that the Company has made available to it the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from the Company’s officers and directors concerning the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the business and financial condition of the Company, and the Investor has received to its satisfaction, such information about the business and financial condition of the Company and the terms and conditions of the Agreement as it has requested. The Investor has carefully considered the potential risks relating to the Company and a purchase of the Units, and fully understands that the Units are speculative investments, which involve a high degree of risk of loss of the Investor’s entire investment. Among others, the undersigned has carefully considered each of the risks identified under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Exchange Act Documents and

	Annex II

	.


	 


	5.3 The Investor acknowledges, represents and agrees that no action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction outside the United States by the Company that would permit an offering of the Units, or possession or distribution of offering materials in connection with the issuance of the Units, in any jurisdiction outside the United States where legal action by the Company for that purpose is required. Investor will comply with all applicable laws and regulations in each foreign jurisdiction in which it purchases, offers, sells or delivers Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares or has in its possession or distributes any offering material, in all cases at its own expense.


	 


	5.4 The Investor hereby covenants with the Company not to make any sale of the Units, Shares, Warrants or Warrant Shares without complying with the provisions of this Agreement, and the Investor acknowledges that the certificates evidencing the Shares will be imprinted with a legend that prohibits their transfer except in accordance therewith. The overall commitment of the Investor to investments, which are not readily marketable, is not excessive in view of the Investor’s net worth and financial circumstances, and any purchase of the Units will not cause such commitment to become excessive. The Investor is able to bear the economic risk of an investment in the Units.







	 




	4







	 




	 




	 


	5.5 The Investor further represents and warrants to, and covenants with, the Company that (i) the Investor has full right, power, authority and capacity to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and has taken all necessary action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and (ii) this Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the Investor enforceable against the Investor in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors’ and contracting parties’ rights generally and except as enforceability may be subject to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).


	 


	5.6 Investor will not use any of the restricted Shares or Warrant Shares acquired pursuant to this Agreement to cover any short position in the Common Stock of the Company if doing so would be in violation of applicable securities laws.


	 


	5.7 The Investor understands that nothing in the Exchange Act Documents, this Agreement or any other materials presented to the Investor in connection with the purchase and sale of the Units constitutes legal, tax or investment advice. The Investor has consulted such legal, tax and investment advisors, as it, in its sole discretion, has deemed necessary or appropriate in connection with its purchase of the Units.


	 


	5.8 The Investor understands that the issuance of the Units to the Investor has not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance upon one or more specific exemptions therefrom, including Regulation D and/or Regulation S, which exemption depends upon, among other things, the accuracy of the Investor’s representations made in this Agreement. The Investor understands that the Units must be held indefinitely unless subsequently registered under the Securities Act and qualified under applicable state securities laws, or unless an exemption from such registration and qualification requirements is otherwise available. The Investor acknowledges that the Company has no obligation to register or qualify the Units or underlying Shares or Warrant Shares for resale. The Investor acknowledges that the Company will refuse to register any transfer of Units, Shares or Warrant Shares that is not made in accordance with the provisions of Regulation S, registered pursuant to the Securities Act or otherwise exempt from such registration. The Investor further acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or qualification is available, it may be conditioned on various requirements including, but not limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for the Shares or Warrant Shares, and requirements relating to the Company which are outside of the Investor’s control, and which the Company is under no obligation and may not be able to satisfy. The Investor has been independently advised as to the applicable holding period imposed in respect of the Shares by securities legislation in the jurisdiction in which the undersigned resides and confirms that no representation has been made respecting the applicable holding periods for the Shares or Warrant Shares in such jurisdiction and it is aware of the risks and other characteristics of the Units and of the fact that the undersigned may not resell the Units, Shares or Warrant Shares except in accordance with applicable securities legislation and regulatory policy.

	Risks Relating to our Business and Financial Condition



	 


	WE LACK OPERATING HISTORY AND HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY REVENUES OR PROFITS TO DATE, AND WE HAVE INCURRED LOSSES IN PRIOR PERIODS AND MAY INCUR LOSSES IN THE FUTURE.


	 


	We cannot be assured that we can achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Our operations are subject to the risks and competition inherent in the establishment of a business enterprise. There can be no assurance that future operations will be profitable. We may not achieve our business objectives and the failure to achieve such goals would have an adverse impact on us.


	 


	OUR FUTURE IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FINANCING. IF WE DO NOT OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING, WE MAY HAVE TO CEASE OUR ACTIVITIES AND INVESTORS COULD LOSE THEIR ENTIRE INVESTMENT.


	 


	There is no assurance that we will operate profitably or generate positive cash flow in the future. We will require additional financing in order to proceed with the development and distribution of our products. We will also require additional financing to pay the fees and expenses necessary to operate as a public company. We will also need more funds if the costs of the development and operation of our existing technologies are greater than we have anticipated. We will also require additional financing to sustain our business operations if we are not successful in earning revenues. We may not be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us when it is required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing. If we do not obtain such financing, our business could fail and investors could lose their entire investment.


	 


	BECAUSE WE MAY NEVER EARN REVENUES FROM OUR OPERATIONS, OUR BUSINESS MAY FAIL AND INVESTORS MAY LOSE ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY.


	 






	 




	9







	 




	 




	 


	We have no history of revenues from operations. We have yet to generate positive earnings and there can be no assurance that we will ever operate profitably. Our company has a limited operating history. If our business plan is not successful and we are not able to operate profitably, then our stock may become worthless and investors may lose all of their investment in our company.


	 


	Prior to obtaining customers and distribution for our products, we anticipate that we will incur increased operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We therefore expect to incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We recognize that if we are unable to generate significant revenues from the sale of our products in the future, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide no assurance that we will generate any revenues or ever achieve profitability. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks, our business will fail and investors may lose all of their investment in our company.


	 


	DRUG DEVELOPMENT IS TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE AND RISKY. TIMING AND RESULTS OF CLINICAL TRIALS TO DEMONSTRATE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE FDA’S APPROVAL OF PRODUCTS, INVOLVE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY.


	 


	We are focused on the development and implementation of nanotechnology platforms related to new and improved pharmaceutical candidates. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development often fail to reach the market for a number of reasons. Clinical trial results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists, medical personnel, regulatory personnel, statisticians and others, which often delays, limits, or prevents further clinical development or regulatory approvals of potential products. Clinical trials can take many years to complete, including the process of study design, clinical site selection and the recruitment of patients. As a result, we can experience significant delays in completing clinical studies, which can increase the cost of developing a drug candidate and shorten the time that an approved product may be protected by patents. If our drug candidates are not successful in human clinical trials, we may be forced to curtail or abandon certain development programs. If we experience significant delays in commencing or completing our clinical studies, we could suffer from significant cost overruns, which could negatively affect our capital resources and our ability to complete these studies.


	 


	Drug development is an inherently risky and uncertain process. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of any new product candidates, we and our partners must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for each intended use. Preclinical and clinical studies may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product. Likewise, we and our partners may not be able to demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate’s therapeutic benefits outweigh its risks. Even promising results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large scale trials. A failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy could or would result in the failure to obtain regulatory approvals.


	 


	We cannot assure you that the Federal Drug Enforcement Agency (FDA) or foreign regulatory agencies will approve, clear for marketing or certify any products developed by us or our partners, on a timely basis, if at all, or, if granted, that such approval will not subject the marketing of our products to certain limits on indicated use. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with the assessment by us or our clinical partners of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently. Such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials. Any limitation on use imposed by the FDA or delay in or failure to obtain FDA approvals or clearances of products developed by us and our partners would adversely affect the marketing of these products and our ability to generate product revenue, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.


	 


	Before obtaining regulatory approvals for certain generic products, we and our partners must conduct limited clinical or other trials to show comparability to the branded products. A failure to obtain satisfactory results in these trials would prevent us from obtaining required regulatory approvals.


	 






	 




	10







	 




	 




	 


	OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, AND BECAUSE WE HAVE A LIMITED OPERATING AND DEVELOPMENT HISTORY, THERE IS A LIMITED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION UPON WHICH INVESTORS CAN EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS.


	 


	We have only a limited history upon which one can evaluate our targeted business and prospects, as our product candidates are still at an early stage of development. We have limited experience and have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. In order to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully execute product development activities using our nanotechnology platform, build, maintain and protect a strong intellectual property portfolio, demonstrate safety and efficacy of our drug candidates in clinical studies, receive FDA approval and gain market acceptance for the development and commercialization of our drug candidates, develop and maintain successful strategic relationships with suppliers, distributors, and potentially licensing partners, and manage our spending and cash requirements as our expenses are expected to increase in the near term due to pre-clinical and clinical trials. If we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop our product candidates, raise capital, expand our business, and continue our operations.


	 


	WE WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COMPLETE OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.


	 


	Our business does not currently generate the cash that is necessary to finance our operations. We will likely need to raise additional capital to:


	 







	 




	·



	Fund research and development activities, including pre-clinical and clinical trials and manufacturing;





	 




	·



	Fund our general corporate and administrative activities;





	 




	·



	Pursue business development activities and strategic partnerships for our technology platforms and drug candidates;





	 




	·



	Build up and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and





	 




	·



	Attract and retain senior management and scientists with relevant experience.




	 


	We will need to raise additional funds through equity offerings, debt financings, or additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements in the future to continue our operations and achieve our research and development objectives. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms that are commercially acceptable and favorable to us. General market conditions may make it very difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets, and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to further delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our planned activities, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.


	 


	WE WILL NEED TO ACHIEVE COMMERCIAL ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES TO GENERATE REVENUES AND ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY.


	 


	The degree to which the medical community and consumers will adopt any product we develop is uncertain. The rate and degree of market acceptance of our products will depend on a number of factors, including the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our products, their potential advantage over alternative treatments, and the costs to patients and third-party payers, including insurance companies and Medicare. Recent efforts in the United States and abroad to reduce overall healthcare spending has put significant pressure on the price of prescription drugs, and certain companies have been publicly criticized for the relatively high cost of their therapies. These pressures may force us to sell any approved pharmaceutical products at a lower price than we or analysts may anticipate, or may result in lower levels of reimbursement and coverage from third parties.


	 


	We cannot predict whether significant market acceptance of our products will ever develop, and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market. Our revenue generation will depend substantially on our ability to introduce products that will be accepted by the medical community. If we are unable to cost-effectively achieve acceptance of our technology among the medical community, or if the products associated with our technology do not achieve wide market acceptance, our business will be materially and adversely affected.


	  






	 




	11







	 




	 




	 


	THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN THE PRODUCT MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. IF WE CANNOT DEVELOP AND MARKET OUR PRODUCTS AS QUICKLY OR COST-EFFECTIVELY AS OUR COMPETITORS, WE MAY NEVER BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS.


	 


	We face substantial competition in the pharmaceutical industry. Competitive factors include product quality and price, reputation, service, product safety, development and efficacy, technological innovation, and access to scientific and technical information. If we fail to compete successfully in any of these areas, our business could be adversely affected and we may never be able to achieve profitable operations.


	 


	Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, pre-clinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing and distributing approved products than we do. Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable.


	 


	We also face competition for marketing, distribution and collaborative development agreements, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, and for licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our platforms. If we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions, our business may suffer.


	 


	ISSUES WITH PRODUCT QUALITY AND PRODUCT DEFECTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT UPON OUR BUSINESS, SUBJECT US TO REGULATORY ACTIONS AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, AND CAUSE A LOSS OF CUSTOMER CONFIDENCE IN US OR OUR PRODUCTS.


	 


	Our success depends upon the quality of our proposed products. Quality management plays an essential role in determining and satisfying requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and maintaining the integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products.


	 


	The development, manufacture, testing, marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products are associated with significant risks of product liability claims or recalls. Side effects or adverse events known or reported to be associated with the products we develop and market could result in product liability claims and/or recalls of one or more of our products. We cannot predict the frequency, outcome or cost to defend any such claims. Product liability insurance coverage is expensive, can be difficult to obtain, and may not be available in the future on commercially acceptable or satisfactory terms, and may not cover all the potential future liabilities we may incur. If we do not have adequate insurance for product liability or clinical trial claims, then we may be subject to significant expenses relating to such potential claims. Although we have not experienced any material claims to date, any such claims could have a material adverse impact on our business.


	 






	 




	12







	 




	 




	 


	WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.


	 


	Our operations and products, and those of our customers, will be regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The design, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical compounds are subject to regulation by governmental authorities, including the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries. The approval process is generally lengthy, expensive, and subject to unanticipated delays.


	 


	Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes to products may be subject to vigorous review, and approvals are not certain. Applicants for FDA approval often must submit extensive clinical data and supporting information to the FDA. Varying interpretations of the data obtained from pre-clinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of a drug product. Changes in FDA approval policy during the development period, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted NDA also may cause delays or rejection of an approval. Even if the FDA approves a product, the approval may limit the uses or “indications” for which a product may be marketed, or may require further studies. The FDA also can withdraw product clearances and approvals for failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if unforeseen problems follow initial marketing.


	 


	The regulatory path for approval of our products may be subject to review by several centers within the FDA, and there is no assurance that the FDA will not change its requirements or review processes and standards. Human clinical testing may be required by the FDA in order to commercialize our products, and there can be no assurance that such trials will be successful. Such changes in review processes or the requirement for clinical studies could delay anticipated launch dates or be at a cost which makes launching the product cost prohibitive for our company or our partners. Such delay or failure to launch these products could adversely affect our revenues and future profitability.


	 


	Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the Company’s operations and consolidated financial statements.


	 


	The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, Office of Inspector General, Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently are considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of our proposed products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. Violations, or allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


	 






	 




	13







	 




	 




	 


	WE ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO A CHANGING REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND POLICIES MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN WAYS THAT WE CANNOT CURRENTLY PREDICT, AND THESE CHANGES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.


	 


	The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in healthcare laws, implementing regulations and policies could impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.


	 


	THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HEALTHCARE REFORM IN THE UNITED STATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.


	 


	The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Healthcare Reform Act”), which was signed into law in March 2010, includes several provisions which may impact our business in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates, reimbursement changes, and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices. We may also experience downward pricing pressure on our proposed products as the Healthcare Reform Act reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals. While the Healthcare Reform Act is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally, the long-term impact of the Act on our business and the demand of our products is uncertain. These changes will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. We cannot predict the impact of the additional regulations that need to be established to implement many of the Healthcare Reform Act’s provisions.


	 


	THE SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES WILL DEPEND IN PART ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AND HEALTH INSURERS ESTABLISH ADEQUATE REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS AND PRICING POLICIES. IF REIMBURSEMENT FOR OUR FUTURE PRODUCTS IS REDUCED OR MODIFIED IN THE UNITED STATES OR ABROAD, OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.


	 


	Sales of our proposed products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private parties, and the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers such as government insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare related organizations. These public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Cost control initiatives may decrease coverage and payment levels for any new drug and, in turn, the price that we will be able to charge. We are unable to predict all the changes to the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will be applied by private or public third-party payers. Any denial of third-party coverage or inadequate reimbursement could harm our business and reduce our revenue. The downward pricing pressures we may experience from third-party payers could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results.


	 


	Austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and demand for our products. Accordingly, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us. If future reimbursement for our approved product candidates is substantially less than we project, or if rebate obligations associated with our products are substantially increased, our business and commercial opportunities could be materially and adversely affected.


	 


	IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OUR PATENTS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, OR IF WE INFRINGE THE PATENTS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, OUR COMPETITIVENESS AND BUSINESS PROSPECTS MAY BE MATERIALLY DAMAGED.


	 


	Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce intellectual property rights relating to or incorporated in our technology and products. We cannot guarantee that any proposed or pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid, or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from developing and marketing certain products or including key features in the company’s products.


	 






	 




	14







	 




	 




	 


	Our issued and future patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing similar technology or products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our technology or products. Changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries could also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing technology or products similar or identical to ours.


	 


	In order to preserve and enforce our patent and other intellectual property rights, we may need to make claims or file lawsuits against third parties. There also can be no assurance that third parties will not assert that our technology or products infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights. This can entail significant costs to us and divert our management’s attention from developing and commercializing our technology or products. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and/or require us to pay substantial damages. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could materially affect future results of operations.


	 


	In addition to patented technology, we will also rely on unpatented proprietary technology, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public. We generally seek to protect this type of proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and third parties. However, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and may have a material impact on our business and financial condition.


	 


	WE MAY BE UNABLE TO ATTRACT REVENUE-GENERATING COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECH COMPANIES TO ADVANCE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS. IF OUR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE UNSUCCESSFUL, OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER, AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.


	 


	We do not possess all of the financial and developmental resources necessary to develop and commercialize the products that may result from our technologies. Accordingly, we will need to make arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize product candidates that may be approved. Our business strategy includes obtaining collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies to support the development of our nanotechnology platforms and drug candidates. We may not be able to attract such partnerships, and even if we are able to enter into such strategic partnerships, the terms may be less favorable than anticipated. Furthermore, entering into such partnership arrangements may limit our commercialization options and flexibility, and the overall success of the development and commercialization of product candidates under such arrangements will depend largely on the efforts of third parties. If we do not find appropriate partners, or if our existing arrangements or future agreements are not successful, our ability to develop and commercialize products could be adversely affected.


	 


	As part of our long-term strategy, we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of our resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other company’s underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected.

	CREDIT MARKET UNCERTAINTY COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.


	 


	Significant deterioration in the financial condition of large financial institutions in recent years resulted in a severe loss of liquidity and available credit in global credit markets and in more stringent borrowing terms. Accordingly, we may be limited in our ability to borrow funds to finance our operations in the future. An inability to obtain sufficient financing at cost-effective rates could have a materially adverse effect on our planned business operations and financial condition.


	 


	OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO RISKS OF TERRORIST ACTS, ACTS OF WAR, POLITICAL UNREST, PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS, LABOR DISPUTES AND NATURAL DISASTERS.


	 


	Terrorist acts, acts of war, political unrest, public health concerns, labor disputes or national disasters may disrupt our operations, as well as those of our customers. These types of acts have created, and continue to create, economic and political uncertainties and have contributed to global economic instability. Future terrorist activities, military or security operations, or natural disasters could weaken the domestic and global economies and create additional uncertainties, thus forcing our customers to reduce their capital spending, or cancel or delay already planned construction projects, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition, including loss of sales or customers.


	 


	THE EXPECTED RESULTS FROM OUR PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED POTENTIAL MERGER WITH NEWGEN BIOPHARMA CORPORATION MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS, AND WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH POTENTIAL MERGER WILL BE COMPLETED.


	 


	The expected results from our potential merger transaction with NewGen NJ might vary materially from those anticipated and disclosed by us, and we can provide no assurance that such potential merger will be completed. These expectations are inherently subject to uncertainties and contingencies. These assumptions may be impacted by factors that are beyond our control, including the business of NewGen NJ, the U.S. economy, our ability to obtain financing to complete the merger with NewGen NJ, and the approval of the potential merger by NewGen NJ’s board of directors and stockholders. Any one of these factors may result in our failure to complete the potential merger and such failure to complete the potential merger may have significant adverse consequences on our ability to operate and survive as a viable entity.


	 


	THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE PROPOSED MERGER WILL IN FACT BE CONSUMMATED, AND ANY FAILURE TO CONSUMMATE SUCH A TRANSACTION MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE LIQUIDITY FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND TO RAISE NECESSARY CAPITAL.


	 


	We have entered into a binding letter of intent with NewGen NJ, dated as of October 27, 2016, which contains various conditions, including approval by NewGen NJ’s stockholders and the entry into definitive agreements. There can be no assurance that the proposed merger transaction will be consummated. Even if we are able to close the potential merger transaction, there is no assurance that we will be able to attract the attention of major brokerage firms and/or that a public market for its securities will develop.


	 



	Risks Relating to our Securities and our Status as a Public Company



	 


	THE RELATIVE LACK OF PUBLIC COMPANY EXPERIENCE OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM MAY PUT US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE.


	 


	Our management team lacks public company experience and is generally unfamiliar with the requirements of the United States securities laws and U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The individual who holds all of the principal officer positions of the company has never had responsibility for managing a publicly traded company. Such responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our senior management may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements. Our failure to comply with all applicable requirements could lead to the imposition of fines and penalties and distract our management from attending to the growth of our business.

	SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH SHARES ARE RESTRICTED OR UNRESTRICTED, ARE SUBJECT TO RESALE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY RULE 144, INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH IN RULE 144(I) WHICH APPLY TO A “SHELL COMPANY.” IN ADDITION, ANY SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT ARE HELD BY AFFILIATES, INCLUDING ANY RECEIVED IN A REGISTERED OFFERING, WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE RESALE RESTRICTIONS OF RULE 144(I).


	 


	Pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Rule 144”), a “shell company” is defined as a company that has no or nominal operations; and, either no or nominal assets; assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents; or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. As such, we may be deemed a “shell company” pursuant to Rule 144 prior to the potential merger, and as such, sales of our securities pursuant to Rule 144 are not able to be made until a period of at least twelve months has elapsed from the date on which our Current Report on Form 8-K is filed with the SEC reflecting our status as a non-“shell company.” Therefore, any restricted securities we sell in the future or issue to consultants or employees, in consideration for services rendered or for any other purpose will have no liquidity until and unless such securities are registered with the SEC and/or until a year after the date of the filing of our Current Report on Form 8-K and we have otherwise complied with the other requirements of Rule 144. As a result, it may be harder for us to fund our operations and pay our employees and consultants with our securities instead of cash. Furthermore, it will be harder for us to raise funding through the sale of debt or equity securities unless we agree to register such securities with the SEC, which could cause us to expend additional resources in the future. Our previous status as a “shell company” could prevent us from raising additional funds, engaging employees and consultants, and using our securities to pay for any acquisitions (although none are currently planned), which could cause the value of our securities, if any, to decline in value or become worthless. Lastly, any shares held by affiliates, including shares received in any registered offering, will be subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144(i).


	 


	WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT RESOURCES TO EVALUATE OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS REQUIRED UNDER SECTION 404 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT, AND ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY OR ANY ADVERSE RESULT FROM SUCH EVALUATION MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR STOCK PRICE.


	 


	As a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”). Section 404 requires us to include an internal control report with our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must include management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. Failure to comply, or any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on the trading price of our equity securities. As of October 31, 2016, the management of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Management concluded, as of the year ended October 31, 2016, that its internal controls and procedures were effective to detect the inappropriate application of U.S. GAAP rules. Achieving continued compliance with Section 404 may require us to incur significant costs and expend significant time and management resources. No assurance can be given that we will be able to fully comply with Section 404 or that we and our independent registered public accounting firm would be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year end. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities, as well as subject us to civil or criminal investigations and penalties. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with our management’s assessment or conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is operating effectively.

	IF WE LOSE OUR KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE OUR BUSINESS OR ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES, AND SUCH LOSS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FUTURE OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.


	 


	Our future success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team and key consultants, and upon our ability to attract and retain senior management and scientists with relevant expertise. If we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key consultants, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us, we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives. We do not have “Key-Man” life insurance policies on our key executives. If we lose the services of any of our key consultants, we may not be able to replace them with similarly qualified personnel, which could harm our business. The loss of our key executives or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees may adversely affect our business, future operations, and financial condition.


	 


	THE ELIMINATION OF MONETARY LIABILITY AGAINST OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES UNDER NEVADA LAW AND THE EXISTENCE OF INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS TO OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES BY OUR COMPANY AND MAY DISCOURAGE LAWSUITS AGAINST OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES.


	 


	Our Bylaws contain a provision permitting us to eliminate the personal liability of our directors to our company and stockholders for damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer to the extent provided by Nevada law. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in the Company incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors and officers, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage our Company from bringing a lawsuit against directors and officers for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors and officers even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit our company and stockholders.


	 


	OUR STOCK IS CATEGORIZED AS A PENNY STOCK. TRADING OF OUR STOCK MAY BE RESTRICTED BY THE SEC’S PENNY STOCK REGULATIONS WHICH MAY LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER’S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK.


	 


	Our stock is categorized as a penny stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than US$ 5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than US$ 5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our securities are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer’s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability of our common stock.


	 






	 




	18







	 




	 




	 


	FINRA SALES PRACTICE REQUIREMENTS MAY ALSO LIMIT A STOCKHOLDER’S ABILITY TO BUY AND SELL OUR STOCK.




	 


	In addition to the “penny stock” rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.


	 


	TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT PAID ANY CASH DIVIDENDS AND NO CASH DIVIDENDS WILL BE PAID IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.




	 


	We do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and we may not have sufficient funds legally available to pay dividends. Even if the funds are legally available for distribution, we may nevertheless decide not to pay any dividends. We presently intend to retain all earnings for our operations.


	 


	OUR COMMON STOCK IS NOT LISTED ON ANY STOCK EXCHANGE AND THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED MARKET FOR SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. EVEN IF A MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK DEVELOPS, OUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE SUBJECT TO WIDE FLUCTUATIONS.


	 


	Our common stock is not listed on any stock exchange. Although our common stock is quoted on the OTCBB, there is no established public market for shares of our common stock. Even if the shares of our common stock may in the future trade on the OTCBB, the liquidity and price of our common stock is expected to be more limited than if such securities were quoted or listed on a national exchange. No assurances can be given that an active public trading market for our common stock will develop or be sustained. The trading volume we develop on the OTCBB may be limited by the fact that many major institutional investment funds, including mutual funds, as well as individual investors, follow a policy of not investing in bulletin board stocks and certain major brokerage firms restrict their brokers from recommending bulletin board stocks because they are considered speculative, volatile and thinly traded. Lack of liquidity will limit the price at which stockholders may be able to sell our common stock.


	 


	The price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations, in response to quarterly variations in our operating results, announcements by us or others, developments affecting us, and other events or factors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many companies, often unrelated to the operating performance of such companies, and may adversely affect the market prices of the securities. Such risks could have an adverse affect on the stock’s future liquidity.


	 


	IF WE ISSUE ADDITIONAL SHARES IN THE FUTURE, IT WILL RESULT IN THE DILUTION OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS.


	 


	Our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of up to 75,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. Our Board of Directors may choose to issue some or all of such shares to acquire one or more companies or assets and to fund our overhead and general operating requirements. The issuance of any such shares may reduce the book value per share and may contribute to a reduction in the market price of the outstanding shares of our common stock. If we issue any such additional shares, such issuance will reduce the proportionate ownership and voting power of all current stockholders. Further, such issuance may result in a change of control of our corporation.


	 






	 




	19







	 




	 




	 


	WE MAY NOT QUALIFY TO MEET LISTING STANDARDS TO LIST OUR STOCK ON AN EXCHANGE.


	 


	The SEC approved listing standards for companies using reverse acquisitions to list on an exchange may limit our ability to become listed on an exchange. We would be considered a reverse acquisition company (i.e., an operating company that becomes an Exchange Act reporting company by combining with a shell Exchange Act reporting company) that cannot apply to list on NYSE, NYSE Amex or Nasdaq until our stock has traded for at least one year on the U.S. OTC market, a regulated foreign exchange or another U.S. national securities market following the filing with the SEC or other regulatory authority of all required information about the potential merger, including audited financial statements. We would be required to maintain a minimum $4 share price ($2 or $3 for NYSE Amex) for at least thirty (30) of the sixty (60) trading days before our application and the exchange’s decision to list. We would be required to have timely filed all required reports with the SEC (or other regulatory authority), including at least one annual report with audited financials for a full fiscal year commencing after filing of the above information. Although there is an exception for a firm underwritten IPO with proceeds of at least $40 million, we do not anticipate being in a position to conduct an IPO in the foreseeable future. To the extent that we cannot qualify for a listing on an exchange, our ability to raise capital will be diminished.


	 


	WE HAVE NOT RETAINED INDEPENDENT PROFESSIONALS FOR INVESTORS.


	 


	We have not retained any independent professionals to review or comment on the offering or otherwise protect the interests of the Investors hereunder. Although the Company has retained its own counsel, such firm has not made any independent examination of any factual matters represented by management herein, and purchasers of the securities offered hereby should not rely on such firm so retained with respect to any matters herein described. Potential investors are encouraged to review all applicable documents with their advisors and conduct such due diligence regarding their potential investment in the Company as they deem appropriate.

	Warrant




	 


	NewGen BioPharma Corp., a Nevada corporation (the “

	Company

	”), for value received, hereby certifies that _______________________ (the “

	Initial Holder

	”), or its registered assigns (the Initial Holder or such registered assigns shall be referred to as the “

	Registered Holder

	”), is entitled, subject to the terms set forth below, to purchase from the Company at any time on or after the Exercise Date and on or before the Expiration Date, up to ___________ shares (the “

	Warrant Shares

	”) of the Company’s common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“

	Common Stock

	”), at a purchase price of $______ per share (the “

	Purchase Price

	”). The number of shares of Warrant Shares and the Purchase Price may be adjusted from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this Warrant. As used herein, “

	Exercise Date

	” means any date after the date hereof and prior to the Expiration Date on which the Registered Holder elects by written notice to the Company to exercise this Warrant.


	 


	This Warrant is issued pursuant to that Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of _______, 20__, by and among the Company and the Initial Holder.


	 


	1.

	Exercise

	.


	 


	(a)

	Manner of Exercise

	. This Warrant may be exercised by the Registered Holder, in whole or in part, by surrendering this Warrant, with the purchase/exercise form appended hereto as

	Exhibit A

	duly executed by such Registered Holder or by such Registered Holder’s duly authorized attorney, at the principal office of the Company, or at such other office or agency as the Company may designate in writing, accompanied by payment in full of the Purchase Price payable in respect of the number of shares of Warrant Shares purchased upon such exercise. The Purchase Price may be paid by cash, check, or wire transfer.


	 


	(b)

	Effective Time of Exercise

	. Each exercise of this Warrant shall be deemed to have been effected immediately prior to the close of business on the day on which this Warrant shall have been surrendered to the Company as provided in Section 1(a) above. At such time, the person or persons in whose name or names any certificates for Warrant Shares shall be issuable upon such exercise as provided in Section 1(c) below shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of the Warrant Shares represented by such certificates.


	 


	(c)

	Delivery to Holder

	. As soon as practicable after the exercise of this Warrant, in whole or in part, and in any event within ten (10) days thereafter, the Company at its expense will cause to be issued in the name of, and delivered to, the Registered Holder, or as such Registered Holder (upon payment by such Registered Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may direct:


	 


	(i) a certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Warrant Shares to which such Registered Holder shall be entitled, and


	 






	 




	1







	 




	 




	 


	(ii) in case such exercise is in part only, a new warrant or warrants (dated the date hereof) of like tenor, calling in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the number of shares of Warrant Shares equal (without giving effect to any adjustment therein) to the number of such shares called for on the face of this Warrant minus the number of such shares purchased by the Registered Holder upon such exercise as provided in Section 1(a) above.


	 


	2.

	Adjustments

	.


	 


	(a)

	Stock Splits and Dividends

	. If outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock shall be subdivided into a greater number of shares or a dividend in Common Stock shall be paid in respect of Common Stock, then the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision or at the record date of such dividend shall simultaneously with the effectiveness of such subdivision or immediately after the record date of such dividend be proportionately reduced. If outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined into a smaller number of shares, then the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, simultaneously with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased. When any adjustment is required to be made in the Purchase Price, the number of shares of Warrant Shares purchasable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be changed to the number determined by dividing (i) an amount equal to the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment, multiplied by the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment, by (ii) the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment.


	 


	(b)

	Reclassification, Etc

	. In case of any reclassification or change of the outstanding securities of the Company or of any reorganization of the Company (or any other corporation the stock or securities of which are at the time receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant) or any similar corporate reorganization on or after the date hereof, then and in each such case the Registered Holder, upon the exercise hereof at any time after the consummation of such reclassification, change, reorganization, merger or conveyance, shall be entitled to receive, in lieu of the stock or other securities and property receivable upon the exercise hereof prior to such consummation, the stock or other securities or property to which such holder would have been entitled upon such consummation if such holder had exercised this Warrant immediately prior thereto, all subject to further adjustment as provided in this Section 2; and in each such case, the terms of this Section 2 shall be applicable to the shares of stock or other securities properly receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant after such consummation.


	 


	(c)

	Adjustment Certificate

	. When any adjustment is required to be made in the Warrant Shares or the Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2, the Company shall promptly mail to the Registered Holder a certificate setting forth (i) a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment, (ii) the Purchase Price after such adjustment and (iii) the kind and amount of stock or other securities or property into which this Warrant shall be exercisable after such adjustment.


	 


	3.

	Transfers

	.


	 


	(a)

	Unregistered Security

	. This Warrant and the Warrant Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “

	Securities Act

	”), and may not be sold, pledged, distributed, offered for sale, transferred or otherwise disposed of in the absence of (i) an effective registration statement under the Act as to this Warrant or such Warrant Shares and registration or qualification of this Warrant or such Warrant Shares under any applicable U.S. federal or state securities law then in effect, or (ii) an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Company, that such registration or qualification is not required. Each certificate or other instrument for Warrant Shares issued upon the exercise of this Warrant shall bear a legend substantially to the foregoing effect.


	 






	 




	2







	 




	 




	 


	(b)

	Transferability.

	Subject to the provisions of Section 3(a) hereof, this Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, upon surrender of the Warrant with a properly executed assignment (in the form of

	Exhibit B

	hereto) at the principal office of the Company.


	 


	(c)

	Warrant Register.

	The Company will maintain a register containing the names and addresses of the Registered Holders of this Warrant. Until any transfer of this Warrant is made in the warrant register, the Company may treat the Registered Holder as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes;

	provided

	,

	however

	, that if this Warrant is properly assigned in blank, the Company may (but shall not be required to) treat the bearer hereof as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. Any Registered Holder may change such Registered Holder’s address as shown on the warrant register by written notice to the Company requesting such change.


	 


	4.

	No Impairment

	. The Company will not, by amendment of its charter or through reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, sale of assets or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but will (subject to Section 11 below) at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Registered Holder against impairment.


	 


	5.

	Termination

	. This Warrant (and the right to purchase securities upon exercise hereof) shall terminate twelve (12) months from the date of issuance of this Warrant (the “

	Expiration Date

	”).


	 


	6.

	Notices of Certain Transactions

	. In the event:


	 


	(a) the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other stock or securities at the time deliverable upon the exercise of this Warrant) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, or to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other right, to subscribe for or purchase any shares of stock of any class or any other securities, or to receive any other right, or


	 


	(b) of any capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification of the capital stock of the Company, or any consolidation or merger of the Company with or into another corporation, or


	 


	(c) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company,


	 


	then, and in each such case, the Company will mail or cause to be mailed to the Registered Holder a notice specifying, as the case may be, (i) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or right, and stating the amount and character of such dividend, distribution or right, or (ii) the effective date on which such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is to take place, and the time, if any is to be fixed, as of which the holders of record of Warrant Shares shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Warrant Shares (or such other stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up. Such notice shall be mailed at least ten (10) days prior to the record date or effective date for the event specified in such notice.


	 


	7.

	Reservation of Stock

	. The Company will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued stock, solely for the issuance and delivery upon the exercise of this Warrant and other similar Warrants, such number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as from time to time shall be issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant and other similar Warrants. All of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant and other similar Warrants, when issued and delivered in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, subject to no lien or other encumbrance other than restrictions on transfer arising under applicable securities laws and restrictions imposed by Section 3 hereof.

	. Upon the surrender by the Registered Holder of any Warrant or Warrants, properly endorsed, to the Company at the principal office of the Company, the Company will, subject to the provisions of Section 3 hereof, issue and deliver to or upon the order of such Holder, at the Company’s expense, a new Warrant or Warrants of like tenor, in the name of such Registered Holder or as such Registered Holder (upon payment by such Registered Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may direct, calling in the aggregate on the face or faces thereof for the number of shares of Common Stock called for on the face or faces of the Warrant or Warrants so surrendered.


	 


	9.

	Replacement of Warrants

	. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) upon delivery of an indemnity agreement (with surety if reasonably required) in an amount reasonably satisfactory to the Company, or (in the case of mutilation) upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company will issue, in lieu thereof, a new Warrant of like tenor.


	 


	10.

	Notices

	. Any notice required or permitted by this Warrant shall be in writing and shall be deemed sufficient upon receipt, when delivered personally or by courier, overnight delivery service or confirmed facsimile, or forty-eight (48) hours after being deposited in the regular mail as certified or registered mail (airmail if sent internationally) with postage prepaid, addressed (a) if to the Registered Holder, to the address of the Registered Holder most recently furnished in writing to the Company and (b) if to the Company, to the address set forth below or subsequently modified by written notice to the Registered Holder.

	. Until the exercise of this Warrant, the Registered Holder shall not have or exercise any rights by virtue hereof as a stockholder of the Company.


	 


	12.

	Representations of Registered Holder

	. By acceptance of this Warrant, the Registered Holder hereby represents and acknowledges to the Company that:

 NEWGEN BIOPHARMA CORP. (OTCMKTS:NEWG) Files An 8-K Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement

Item 1.02 Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.


On March 28, 2017, NewGen BioPharma Corp., a Nevada corporation
(the Company), received notice from the President of NewGen
BioPharma Corporation, a New Jersey corporation (NewGen New
Jersey), of NewGen New Jerseys intent to terminate the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated January 10, 2017 (the Merger Agreement),
by and among the Company, NewGen New Jersey, and NewGen Merger
Sub Inc., a New Jersey corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company formed for the purpose of the transaction. to the
terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company agreed to issue
40,000,000 shares of its common stock to the shareholders of
NewGen New Jersey in exchange for the acquisition of all the
issued and outstanding capital stock of NewGen New Jersey through
a reverse triangular merger (the Merger). Upon the closing of the
Merger, NewGen New Jersey was to become the wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company. The terms and conditions of the Merger
Agreement were previously disclosed in further detail in our
Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the SEC) on January 11, 2017.


In furtherance of the Merger Agreement, Dr. Navdeep Jaikaria, the
founder and President of NewGen New Jersey, was elected as a
director of the Company on January 26, 2017. Also in furtherance
of the Merger Agreement, and in consideration for Dr. Jaikarias
willingness to serve as a director pending the closing of the
Merger, the Company granted Dr. Jaikaria 11,000,000 restricted
shares of the Companys common stock on February 23, 2017, to the
terms set forth in a Restricted Stock Award Agreement, as
previously disclosed on our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with
the SEC on February 27, 2017. The Restricted Stock Award
Agreement provides that if the closing of the Merger does not
occur, the restricted shares granted to Dr. Jaikaria will be
forfeited in their entirety, and Dr. Jaikaria will have no
ownership interest with respect thereto.


to the terms of the Binding Letter of Intent dated October 27,
2016 (the LOI), by and between the Company and NewGen New Jersey,
the Company changed its name from Greenwind NRG Inc. to NewGen
BioPharma Corp. on November 18, 2016 in anticipation of a change
in the Companys business plan and direction in connection with
the Merger Agreement. The LOI provides that if the closing of the
Merger does not occur, the Company shall immediately change its
name to one unrelated to NewGen. The Company is currently in the
process of seeking the necessary approvals to file a Certificate
of Amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State changing its name
to an unrelated name, and will file a subsequent current report
on Form 8-K when such amendment is made effective.


The Merger Agreement contains certain termination provisions for
the parties, including, without limitation, (i) a provision
stating that any party has the right to terminate the Merger
Agreement if the closing of the Merger has not occurred on or
before January 31, 2017 for any reason other than delay or
nonperformance of the party seeking such termination, and (ii)
provisions stating that either party may terminate the agreement
if the other party fails to perform in any material respect its
obligations under the Merger Agreement, or materially breaches
any of its representations, warranties or covenants contained in
the Merger Agreement.


On March 28, 2017, the trading of the Companys common stock was
temporarily suspended by the SEC until April 10, 2017. In light
of these circumstances and the termination provisions contained
in the Merger Agreement, NewGen New Jersey delivered notice to
the Company on March 28, 2017 of its intent to terminate the
Merger Agreement. to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the
termination of the Merger Agreement shall terminate all
obligations of the parties thereunder, except for obligations
relating to any liability for a partys material breach of the
Merger Agreement or its representations, warranties and covenants
contained therein. The Company is not subject to any early
termination penalties in connection with the termination of the
Merger Agreement.

















SECTION 5 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT


Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers;
Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.


Resignation of Director


On March 28, 2017, Dr. Navdeep Jaikaria resigned as a director of
the Company. Dr. Jaikaria was elected as a director of the
Company on January 26, 2017 in furtherance of the Merger
Agreement described above, and he resigned from such position
effective as of March 28, 2017. To the knowledge of the Company,
Dr. Jaikaria did not have any disagreements with the Company on
any matter relating to the Companys operations, policies or
practices. Rather, Dr. Jaikarias resignation arose out of the
failure of the Company and NewGen New Jersey to close the Merger
to the terms of the Merger Agreement, as described in further
detail under Item 1.02 above. Dr. Jaikarias letter of resignation
is attached hereto as Exhibit 17.1 and incorporated by reference
herein.

A corporation is a type of entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State within the state of incorporation. Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares while the management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also will draft bylaws for the corporation Bylaws are basically written protocols that define the way that the corporation will be governed. Corporations are required to hold annual meetings for both the shareholders and the board of directors. The annual meetings are held to discuss and decide on important decisions that are faced by the corporation.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting a C Corporation




 Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S-Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.



 In What State Should I Form my LLC or Corporation?

Unless you plan on having a large, multi-state operation, it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is located.Generally speaking, most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business and/or a physical presence in that state. If you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located, you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign (out of state) company with your home state, which will subject you to all of the fees, taxes, and regulations of that state.



 What are the Differences Between Officers, Directors and Shareholders?

A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.





 What is a C Corporation?


A C Corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners, and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation (Note: The "C" in C Corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code; C Corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations, and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations).
C Corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners, where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to "pass-through" to the personal income tax statements of the owners. As such, C Corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities. C Corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business, if desired, and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income. C Corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends, but this can also lead to double taxation.



 What is Stock Par Value?

Par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares. It doesn't necessarily reflect their real value, and is typically set at a low value (i.e. one dollar or one cent). The par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders, and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class. The shares can be sold to the initial shareholders, at par value or more, but the price must be the same for each share. Not all states require a par value. Unless you specify otherwise, IncFile will authorize 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with a par value of one cent, or at no par value if not required by your state.



 What are Bylaws?

The bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws. Bylaws are not filed with the state.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.

We conduct a thorough name search with the state corporation database and will work with you
as
long as needed to find an available company
name.
