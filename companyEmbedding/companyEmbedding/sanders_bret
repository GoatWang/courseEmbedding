Dimensions: 9.0in. x 6.0in. x 0.4in.There is but one New Orleans, they say, bustling with joie de vivre, celebrating non-stop, but step closer, into the clinging, honeysuckle-scented air, and you will find a darker version of the Big Easy, depending on what you believe is true. Tales of vampires, werewolves, curses, and mysterious half-human bayou creatures are pervasive in New Orleans culture. Visitors may pass them off as folk tales and superstitions, but the locals know to never go into the deep swamp alone or into the cemetery at night. Tale or truth In New Orleans, the line between them bleeds. This item ships from multiple locations. Your book may arrive from Roseburg,OR, La Vergne,TN. Paperback.
