(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF PLAN OF OPERATION  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  Introduction  Allied Ventures Holdings Corp., (the Company), was incorporated on March 31, 1980, under the laws of the State of California as Expertelligence, Inc. On June 26, 2006, the Company reincorporated in Nevada. On March 24, 2011, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Pay Mobile, Inc. On January 2, 2013, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Allied Ventures Holding Corp. On February 21, 2013 the Company changed its name to Dephasium Corp. and thereafter, on February 23, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change its name to Allied Ventures Holdings Corp.  On March 24, 2011, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Agreement) with Pay Mobile, Inc. (PMD) a Delaware corporation and its shareholders. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of PMD. On June 11, 2012 the Agreement with PMD was rescinded and the common shares of the Company which were previously issued to the PMD shareholders pursuant to the Agreement were canceled.  On March 5, 2013, the Registrant entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the purchase of certain patents and trademarks from Dephasium, Ltd., a limited partnership organized under the laws of the United Kingdom. Pursuant to the Agreement, in consideration of the transfer to the Registrant of the ANCILIA patent and trademark, Registration Number 4,085,620, the Registrant agreed to issue Dephasium 70,000,000 shares of its restricted common stock. In addition, in consideration of $15,000, the Registrant redeemed and cancelled 50,000,000 shares of its restricted common stock previously issued its former sole officer and director, Colon-Alonso, who as of that date, ceased to be a shareholder of the Registrant. The Registrant has also agreed to name Lucien Gerard AIM to its Board of Directors.  In exchange for the issuance of the 70,000,000 shares of our restricted common stock, we relied on a Patent Evaluation which had been received from an independent third party, OMECA for purposes of determining the patent's value. At that time. Dephasium, Ltd., had already established a web site for its operations in Europe which can viewed at www.dephasiums.com. Thereafter, Dephasium Ltd. set up an online store at www.Dephasiumstore.com. The on line store enabled the Company to sell the products which it was distributing in the United States and Canada in conjunction with its Distribution Agreement with Dephasium, Ltd. The Company was to receive 30% of the revenues generated from sales within the United States and Canada.Unfortunately, the site failed to generate any sales and the Company does not have the resources to hire a sales force to market the products in the United States and Canada. As such, the Company has determined that it is in its best interest to discontinue its plans to sell products in the United States and Canada. In doing so, the Company has also determined that the ANCILIA patent does not have any value on our books and records.  Effective as of the close of business December 30, 2013, Lucien Gerard resigned as a Director of the Company. That left Francisco Terreforte as our sole Director.  Effective December 31, 2013 the Company entered into two agreements with Dephasium Ltd. The first one was a restructuring of its prior Asset Purchase Agreement whereby the Company had issued 70,000,000 to Dephasium Ltd. In exchange for the ANCILIA patent and trademark registration number 4,085,627. Pursuant to the Restructuring Agreement, the Company transferred back the ANCILIA patent and trademark and Dephasium Ltd. agreed to cancel the 70,000,000 shares of the Company's common which were previously issued to it. In addition the Company committed up to $25,000 to be used to market Dephasium, Ltd.'s products and entered into a separate Licensing Agreement with with Dephasium, Ltd. That Licensing Agreement, also dated December 31, 2013, granted the Company a license to market Dephasium, Ltd. products in North American in return for a 25% net license fee. That licensing agreement expired on December 31, 2014.  In addition, on December 31, 2013 Hal Lansky entered into a Promissory Note with the Company in the sum of $50,000 in return for the Company agreeing to issue him 50,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The stock was to be cancelled if the $50,000 due on the Note was not paid to the Company on or before July 1, 2014. The Company received the $50,000 on June 30, 2014 and as such the Note has been canceled and the funds have been added to the working capital of the Company. Furthermore, as reported in the 8-K filed with the SEC on January 24, 2015, J. Francisco resigned as an office and director of the Company, thus resigning all his positions and Harold Minksky was appointed the Company's sole officer and director.  Current Status of our Business  The Company has not yet generated or realized any revenues from business operations. The Company's business strategy has changed to seeking potential merger candidates and we are now considered a shell as defined by the SEC. The Company's auditors have issued a going concern opinion in our audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. This means that our auditors believe there is doubt that the Company can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless it obtains additional capital to pay its bills. This is because the Company has not generated any revenues and no revenues are currently anticipated. Accordingly, we must raise cash from sources such as investments by others in the Company and through possible transactions with strategic or joint venture partners. We do not plan to use any capital raised for the purchase or sale of any plant or significant equipment. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company and the accompanying notes appearing subsequently under the caption "Financial Statements."  Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2013  Revenues  The Company did not generate any revenues from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2014 or for the three months ended March 31, 2013. Accordingly, comparisons with prior periods are not meaningful. The Company is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and cost increases in services.  Operating Expenses  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2014 were $2,605 as compared to $9,911 for the three month period ended March 31, 2013. The decrease of $7,306 is primarily attributable to the absence of legal fees in the quarter ended March 31, 2014 and a decrease in auditor fees because the December 31, 2013 audit was not commenced until the fourth quarter of 2014.  Net Loss  Our net loss for the three month period ended March 31, 2014 was $2,605as compared to a net loss for the three month period ended March 31, 2013 of $9,911. The reason for the decrease in loss is explained in the "Operating Expenses" section in the preceding paragraph.  At March 31, 2014, our accumulated deficit was $2,589,100 as compared to an accumulated deficit of $2,586,495 as of December 31, 2013. The increase in the accumulated deficit is a result of the $2,605 loss for the three months ended March 31, 2014.  Assets and Liabilities  As of March 31, 2014, our total assets were $2,708 as compared to $313 at December 31, 2013. The increase of $2,395 is attributable to an increase in cash of $2,395 resulting from a cash inflow of $5,000 from a short term note payable reduced by net cash used in operating activities of $2,605.  Total Current Liabilities were $14,991 at March 31, 2014 as compared to $9,991 at December 31, 2013. The $5,000 increase results from a short-term note loan received by the Company.  Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources  At March 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,708. As of March 31, 2014 the Company's only debt was comprised of a short term loan payable in the amount of $9,475 which is in default and a $5,000 short-term note payable.  The Company had a working capital deficit of $12,283 at March 31, 2014 and $9,678 at December 31, 2013, respectively. The increase in the working capital deficit of $2,605 is attributable to the loss for the three months ended March 31, 2014.  For the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 the net cash used by operating activities was $2,605 and $9,911, respectively, which was comprised entirely of the net loss for the respective periods as there were no adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used by operating activities and there were no changes in operating assets and liabilities. The reason for the decline in loss is explained in the 'Net Loss' section shown above.  For the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 the net cash provided by financing activities was $5,000 and $50,000, respectively. The $5,000 cash provided in the 2014 period is from a short-term note payable. The $50,000 cash provided in the 2013 period is from the sale of common stock.  For the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 the increase in cash was $2,395 and $40,089, respectively. The reason for the decline in the increase in cash in 2014 is explained in the two preceding paragraphs.  No trends have been identified which would materially increase or decrease our results of operations or liquidity.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We are not currently a party to, or otherwise involved with, any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial position, operating results, liquidity, capital expenditures of capital resources.
