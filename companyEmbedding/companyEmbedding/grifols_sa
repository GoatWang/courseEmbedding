Main products[edit]
Grifols is the major world supplier of IVIG, albumin, Factor VIII and other plasma-derived products.
Main operations[edit]
In 2007 the company had 3.6 million litres per year of blood fractionation capacity from three plants, one at Parets del Vallès near Barcelona in Spain (2.1 million litres per year), another in Los Angeles (1.5 million litres but being expanded to 2.2 million litres), and a site in Clayton, NC. In the United States the company owns 153 plasmapheresis centres, where it collects around 5.8 million litres of plasma per year.
Ownership[edit]
Grifols was listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange in May 2006.[4] The stock became part of the IBEX 35 index in January 2008.
History[edit]




Human immunoglobulin for anti-tetanus use and antithrombin produced by Grifols.


Grifols' origin lies in the laboratory founded in 1940 in Barcelona by Dr José A. Grifols Roig, a hematologist and scientist. Dr Grifols was the first researcher to publish the plasmapheresis procedure in 1951. The company introduced its liquid IVIG product into the European market in the mid-1990s.
Probitas Pharma, S.A. was incorporated with high limited liability under Spanish law on 22 June 1987; on 27 June 2005 the company changed its name to Grifols, S.A.[5] In 2003 the company acquired certain assets of the Los Angeles-based Alpha Therapeutic (US subsidiary of Mitsubishi Pharma) as the basis of its American expansion.[6] On May 17, 2006, Grifols securities were listed on Spain’s Mercado Continuo.[7]
In 2009, CSL Limited attempted to takeover Talecris Biotherapeutics (the former plasma business of Bayer HealthCare LLC, Biological Products Division)[8] for $3,1 billion but was stopped by the Federal Trade Commission.[9] On June 1, 2011, a year after announcing the $4 billion deal, Grifols completed a takeover of Talecris Biotherapeutics, headquartered in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, with over 2000 employees.[10]
Grifols acquired the blood transfusion diagnostics unit from Novartis in 2013 as a "platform for global expansion".[3] This unit is based in Emeryville, California and was a part of Chiron acquired by Novartis in 2006.[3]
In 2015, the company acquired a 45% stake in Alkahest as part of planned co-development of "plasma-based products for the treatment of cognitive decline in aging and disorders of the CNS, including Alzheimer's."[11]
In December 2016, Grifols acquired Hologics interest in their existing joint blood screening unit for $1.85 billion[12]

History[edit]




Human immunoglobulin for anti-tetanus use and antithrombin produced by Grifols.


Grifols' origin lies in the laboratory founded in 1940 in Barcelona by Dr José A. Grifols Roig, a hematologist and scientist. Dr Grifols was the first researcher to publish the plasmapheresis procedure in 1951. The company introduced its liquid IVIG product into the European market in the mid-1990s.
Probitas Pharma, S.A. was incorporated with high limited liability under Spanish law on 22 June 1987; on 27 June 2005 the company changed its name to Grifols, S.A.[5] In 2003 the company acquired certain assets of the Los Angeles-based Alpha Therapeutic (US subsidiary of Mitsubishi Pharma) as the basis of its American expansion.[6] On May 17, 2006, Grifols securities were listed on Spain’s Mercado Continuo.[7]
In 2009, CSL Limited attempted to takeover Talecris Biotherapeutics (the former plasma business of Bayer HealthCare LLC, Biological Products Division)[8] for $3,1 billion but was stopped by the Federal Trade Commission.[9] On June 1, 2011, a year after announcing the $4 billion deal, Grifols completed a takeover of Talecris Biotherapeutics, headquartered in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, with over 2000 employees.[10]
Grifols acquired the blood transfusion diagnostics unit from Novartis in 2013 as a "platform for global expansion".[3] This unit is based in Emeryville, California and was a part of Chiron acquired by Novartis in 2006.[3]
In 2015, the company acquired a 45% stake in Alkahest as part of planned co-development of "plasma-based products for the treatment of cognitive decline in aging and disorders of the CNS, including Alzheimer's."[11]
In December 2016, Grifols acquired Hologics interest in their existing joint blood screening unit for $1.85 billion[12]

Main products[edit]
Grifols is the major world supplier of IVIG, albumin, Factor VIII and other plasma-derived products.
Main operations[edit]
In 2007 the company had 3.6 million litres per year of blood fractionation capacity from three plants, one at Parets del Vallès near Barcelona in Spain (2.1 million litres per year), another in Los Angeles (1.5 million litres but being expanded to 2.2 million litres), and a site in Clayton, NC. In the United States the company owns 153 plasmapheresis centres, where it collects around 5.8 million litres of plasma per year.
Ownership[edit]
Grifols was listed on the Madrid Stock Exchange in May 2006.[4] The stock became part of the IBEX 35 index in January 2008.
History[edit]




Human immunoglobulin for anti-tetanus use and antithrombin produced by Grifols.


Grifols' origin lies in the laboratory founded in 1940 in Barcelona by Dr José A. Grifols Roig, a hematologist and scientist. Dr Grifols was the first researcher to publish the plasmapheresis procedure in 1951. The company introduced its liquid IVIG product into the European market in the mid-1990s.
Probitas Pharma, S.A. was incorporated with high limited liability under Spanish law on 22 June 1987; on 27 June 2005 the company changed its name to Grifols, S.A.[5] In 2003 the company acquired certain assets of the Los Angeles-based Alpha Therapeutic (US subsidiary of Mitsubishi Pharma) as the basis of its American expansion.[6] On May 17, 2006, Grifols securities were listed on Spain’s Mercado Continuo.[7]
In 2009, CSL Limited attempted to takeover Talecris Biotherapeutics (the former plasma business of Bayer HealthCare LLC, Biological Products Division)[8] for $3,1 billion but was stopped by the Federal Trade Commission.[9] On June 1, 2011, a year after announcing the $4 billion deal, Grifols completed a takeover of Talecris Biotherapeutics, headquartered in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, with over 2000 employees.[10]
Grifols acquired the blood transfusion diagnostics unit from Novartis in 2013 as a "platform for global expansion".[3] This unit is based in Emeryville, California and was a part of Chiron acquired by Novartis in 2006.[3]
In 2015, the company acquired a 45% stake in Alkahest as part of planned co-development of "plasma-based products for the treatment of cognitive decline in aging and disorders of the CNS, including Alzheimer's."[11]
In December 2016, Grifols acquired Hologics interest in their existing joint blood screening unit for $1.85 billion[12]

 Our company Our Products Our Leadership Our Patients Our Donors















Our products

	Globally Grifols develops and produces more than a dozen plasma-derived protein therapies as well as products and IV solutions designed for hospital pharmacies, hospitals and laboratories. Our wide range of therapies and products are distributed through three primary divisions: Bioscience, Diagnostic and Hospital.

Bioscience

	As our largest segment of the business, the Bioscience division is committed to discovering, developing and producing plasma-derived protein therapies to treat patients whose diseases in many cases cannot be adequately treated with traditional pharmaceuticals. The essential proteins found in human plasma are used to replace or restore missing proteins among patients who have rare, genetic diseases such as immune deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, bleeding or blood-clotting disorders and genetic emphysema. Our protein therapies are also administered to prevent the onset of life-threatening infections such as rabies, hepatitis and tetanus. Bioscience products are sold in more than 90 countries worldwide.

Diagnostic

	Our Diagnostic division focuses on researching, developing, manufacturing and marketing in vitro diagnostic products for laboratory analyses, including auto-analyzers and reagents for hospital blood banks and transfusion centers. These innovative diagnostic solutions are sold in the U.S. and more than seventy other countries worldwide.

Hospital

	Our Hospital division supplies a wide range of intravenous solutions for hospital pharmacies and medical devices for surgical procedures.  These products are divided into four specialties – IV Therapy, Clinical Nutrition, Hospital Logistics and Medical Devices – and are available in some European and Latin American countries.

 Our company Our Products Our Leadership Our Patients Our Donors















Our company

Our Company

	At Grifols, we take pride in our innovative achievements, strong customer service, sterling safety record and adherence to the highest standards of honesty and professional ethics. We have an unwavering commitment to the development of safer and more effective blood and plasma therapies as well as innovative products designed for hospitals, laboratory professionals and healthcare providers.

	Our company develops and produces therapies and products in three healthcare divisions: Bioscience therapies made from human plasma; Hospital products and pharmacy IV solutions; and Diagnostic tools for laboratory professionals.

Our U.S. Presence

	Grifols has a strong presence in the United States, where our products and therapies are widely distributed. We own and operate 147 plasma donor centers, where we collect plasma from qualified individuals and send it to one of our three, state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities. There, specialized engineers and technicians are responsible for extracting fragile proteins from plasma and purifying them for use in one of our many protein therapies. Our manufacturing sites are located in Clayton, North Carolina; Los Angeles California; and Melville, New York.

Our History

	The inspiration for present-day Grifols began in 1910 in Barcelona, Spain, in the pioneering research laboratories of hematologist Dr. Jose Antonio Grifols Roig. Dr. Grifols and his two sons incorporated Laboratorios Grifols in 1940 to advance their work in the developing fields of transfusion, blood banking and clinical analysis.

	The laboratory focused its research on improving the process of blood transfusions and creating tools for clinical analysis. In 1943, the laboratory began researching the potential applications of lyophilization, or freeze-drying, and as it related to human blood products such as plasma.

	Grifols patented this process in Spain and developed a lyophilizer as well as instrumentation to later inject this plasma into people. These products laid the foundations for the opening of the first private blood bank in Spain in 1945. In 1952, Grifols registered a patent on a new glucosaline solution and the company began industrial production on its first line of IV products.

Innovations

	At Grifols, we approach challenges and opportunities with the eyes of experience as well as through a fresh perspective that considers new ways of solving old problems. We combine experience, flexibility and original thinking to arrive at innovative solutions for patients, hospitals and healthcare professionals.


		Grifols sustains a full and active research and development program that has acquired more than 300 patents in over 30 countries for plasma-derived therapies alone, and some 200 official product registrations in more than 50 countries. Grifols serves healthcare professionals and patients in over 90 countries around the world.

		Our innovative spirit has led to the formation of our own engineering and design group that has custom designed machines and facilities for both Grifols and other bio-pharmaceutical companies throughout the world.

		Our plasma screening processes were the first approved by the FDA to use Nucleic Amplification Testing methods — a process that not only detects a whole virus, but can also detect non-infectious virus fragments.

		Our FDA-approved manufacturing facilities are among the most modern in existence and compare favorably with biological plants anywhere in the world.
