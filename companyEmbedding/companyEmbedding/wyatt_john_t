Obtained a defense verdict for an anesthesiologist who was alleged to have negligently performed an evaluation and work-up in administering a cervical epidural steroid injection causing the patient to suffer a bleed in their spinal canal. The plaintiff's prior history involved significant liver disease, an enlarged spleen, a low platelet count and anemia.

A decision was obtained in favor of the Defendant doctor even though it was found that a proper work-up had not been done by arguing that even though a proper work-up may not have been done, the Plaintiff was still a proper candidate for a cervical epidural steroid injection and the standard of care was met in administering same.
