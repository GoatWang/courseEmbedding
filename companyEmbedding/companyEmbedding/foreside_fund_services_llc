Foreside Acquires Beacon Hill Fund Services






June 23, 2016 04:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time



PORTLAND, Maine--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Foreside Financial Group LLC (“Foreside”) announced today the 
      acquisition of Beacon Hill Fund Services (“Beacon Hill”) located in 
      Columbus, Ohio. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
      The acquisition is expected to close on July 31.
    

      In operation since 2008, Beacon Hill provides a variety of business 
      management services to both US and non-US investment managers. With a 
      staff of 22 professionals, Beacon Hill provides services to 19 clients 
      with 144 funds and $28.6 billion in assets.
    

      “The acquisition of Beacon Hill brings together some of the industry’s 
      most experienced professionals and enhances our management, services, 
      and opportunities for growth. Foreside and Beacon Hill share a strategic 
      vision to broaden our scope of products and services, and to enhance our 
      core services for investment managers and their funds, in both the U.S. 
      and offshore markets”, commented Richard Berthy, CEO of Foreside.
    

      Added scale was an important factor in making the acquisition. Foreside 
      and Beacon Hill provide many of the same products and services, such as 
      an array of distribution services, fund officer services and regulatory 
      and compliance consulting services.
    

      “Investment managers in every market are increasingly seeking a focused, 
      objective and independent partner to provide advice and customized 
      solutions to all aspects of management, governance, and distribution to 
      help grow their businesses. The combination of Foreside and Beacon Hill 
      brings a robust organization that works in concert with investment 
      managers to build, manage, and grow their products and franchises. We 
      believe these capabilities and our unique focus truly differentiate 
      Foreside in the global marketplace”, commented David Whitaker, President 
      of Foreside.

Burnham Asset Management Selects Foreside Financial Services, LLC as Distributor of Burnham Investors Trust

Feb 16, 2016, 08:00 ET
		  		  			
									 from   Burnham Asset Management Corp. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK, Feb. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Burnham Asset Management Corp. ("BAM") announced today that its mutual fund group, Burnham Investors Trust, has selected Foreside Financial Group, LLC to be the Funds' distributor, effective February 16, 2016.
The Burnham Investor Trust family of funds includes flagship Burnham Fund (BURHX Class A shares), Burnham Financial Services Fund (BURKX Class A shares) and Burnham Financial Long/Short Fund (BURFX Class A shares).  
BAM was acquired by BAM Holdings in early 2015, and its new management group has made substantial investments in the areas of infrastructure, marketing and distribution. The relationship with Foreside will allow BAM to focus its expertise on growing its differentiated mutual funds and Burnham's other offerings including separate account strategies and alternative investments. BAM's assets under management grew materially in 2015, due in part to an increase in net subscriptions into its financial sector mutual funds.  
For more information about Burnham Funds, please visit the website at www.burnhamfunds.com, or call 800.874.FUND (3863).   
For information about Burnham Asset Management, please contact us at 212-262-3100.   
Contact name: Frank Passantino, 212.603.7522
For more complete information about the Funds, including a free prospectus and performance current to the most recent month-end, please call at 800-874-FUND, or visit the website at www.burnhamfunds.com. The prospectus contains important information about the funds, including investment objectives, risks, management fees, sales charges, and other expenses which you should consider carefully. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.
Owning mutual fund shares involves investment risk, including possible loss of principal. There are special risks associated with sector funds, which primarily limit their investments to companies in specific industries. These types of fund may be susceptible to factors affecting these industries, and each fund's value may fluctuate more than a fund that invests in a wider range of industries. Because this fund concentrates its investments in one sector of the economy (Financial Services fund), and it invests in derivative securities (Financial long/short fund), investors should consider these risks because they may experience greater volatility than in a fund that invests across several sectors. In particular, companies within the financial services sector have recently been subject to unprecedented stock price volatility and depreciation, and there is significant uncertainty regarding the viability and prospects of many financial services companies. Investments in derivatives could magnify any of the fund's gains or losses. Derivatives involve a number of risks, including possible default by the other party to the transaction, illiquidity and, to the extent the manager's view of certain market, security or interest rate movements is incorrect, the risk that the use of derivatives could result in losses greater than if they had not been used. 
The Burnham Investors Trust funds are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC
