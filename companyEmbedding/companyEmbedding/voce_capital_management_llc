Voce Capital Presses Rudolph Technologies, Nanometrics to Merge
Jan 19 17
Voce Capital Management, LLC is pressing Nanometrics Incorporated (NasdaqGS:NANO) and Rudolph Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:RTEC) to merge, saying the two would be stronger together. In a letter to investors on January 19, 2017, Voce Capital Management LLC said a combination of Rudolph and Nanometrics would lead to cost-cutting and revenue growth through cross-selling to each other’s customers. Voce Capital Management owns about 1% of each company. The two companies have been in talks about a deal, according to people familiar with the matter, but it isn’t clear where they currently stand.

Voce Capital: ConMed Board Refuses Voce Offer to Settle Proxy Contest | Business Wire
























































Voce Capital: ConMed Board Refuses Voce Offer to Settle Proxy Contest




ConMed Refuses to Appoint Independent Nominees Jim Green and Josh 
      Levine to Board


Board Misrepresents the Facts About its Faux Attempts to 
      “Negotiate” with Voce






August 26, 2014 09:05 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Voce Capital Management LLC (“Voce”) made the following statement today 
      relating to the pending proxy contest with CONMED Corporation (“ConMed” 
      or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:CNMD):
    


      In the interest of constructive compromise, yesterday Voce offered to 
      withdraw its proxy solicitation if the Board would appoint two of Voce’s 
      independent nominees to the Board: James W. Green, the President and 
      CEO, and a director, of Analogic (Nasdaq:ALOG) and Joshua H. Levine, the 
      President and CEO, and a director, of Accuray (Nasdaq:ARAY). Neither Mr. 
      Green nor Mr. Levine has any ties or affiliations with Voce and both are 
      outstanding, highly experienced CEOs of publicly-traded medical device 
      companies. Yet the Board wouldn’t even respond to Voce’s proposal.
    

      Voce notes that it has previously reduced its slate from five nominees 
      to three to reflect the evolution of the Board in recent months and to 
      selectively address ConMed’s most pressing needs. As such, Voce believes 
      its offer to accept the appointment of two independent directors is both 
      reasonable and reflective of a significant compromise on Voce’s part.
    

      J. Daniel Plants, Voce’s Managing Partner, said: “The Board’s 
      unwillingness to accept our proposal is further evidence that its ploy 
      to appear responsive is not credible. If ConMed truly means what it says 
      about avoiding a contested election and focusing exclusively on the 
      interests of shareholders, it should put aside its petty grievances with 
      us and appoint Messrs. Green and Levine to the Board.”
    

      Ironically, despite its contrary actions, the Board simultaneously 
      continues to assert that it “offered settlement negotiations to Voce 
      five months ago,” which Voce categorically denies – again. The Board has 
      made only one proposal, in July 2014, which Voce attempted to negotiate 
      in good faith. The Board rejected out of hand Voce’s attempt to engage 
      with the Board, insisting that its initial proposal was “best and final” 
      and “not negotiable.” Further, the Board issued an ultimatum that if 
      Voce didn’t accept it ConMed would “move forward with a contested 
      shareholder meeting.” The Board’s repeated references to its unrequited 
      desire to work “constructively” with Voce cannot be taken seriously in 
      our view given the Board’s prior behavior, unreliable account of events 
      and failure to accept Voce’s latest settlement offer.
    

      The Board recently filed a presentation rife with other misleading and 
      inaccurate information, which is rebutted in a separate presentation to 
      be filed by Voce today with the SEC.
    

      Mr. Plants concluded: “We have made two reasonable proposals in an 
      effort to resolve matters short of a proxy contest, and the ‘new’ ConMed 
      Board has now refused them both while propagating the false narrative 
      that they wish to engage and compromise, if only Voce would reciprocate. 
      The Board’s intransigence illustrates why further changes are still 
      needed at ConMed.”
    

      Voce encourages its fellow shareholders to execute and return the WHITE 
      proxy card. In addition to Messrs. Green and Levine, Voce’s third 
      nominee is J. Daniel Plants, Managing Partner of Voce and a former 
      investment banking executive at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan.

“In times of political confusion, and under an arbitrary government, many will prefer to keep their capital inactive, concealed, and unproductive, either of profit or gratification, rather than run the risk of its display. This latter evil is never felt under a good government.”

“There are no taxes which have not a tendency to lessen the power to accumulate. All taxes must either fall on capital or revenue. If they encroach on capital, they must proportionably diminish that fund by whose extent the extent of the productive industry of the country must always be regulated; and if they fall on revenue, they must either lessen accumulation, or force the contributors to save the amount of the tax, by making a corresponding diminution of their former unproductive consumption of the necessaries and luxuries of life. Some taxes will produce these effects in a much greater degree than others; but the great evil of taxation is to be found, not so much in any selection of its objects, as in the general amount of its effects taken collectively.”

About Voce's Quotes

Each quarter, for inspiration we turn to our favorite writers and warriors; scientists and statesmen; musicians, magicians and politicians; investors and business leaders; thinkers and tinkerers; artistes, aesthetes and auteurs.  The current curation of quotes (from our 2015 Annual Letter) pay homage to Shakespeare, as 2016 marks the quartercentenary of his passing (April 23, 1616).

Voce seeks to maximize long term value for all FBR stockholders

Voce Capital Management LLC and its affiliates (“Voce”) along with its nominees own 390,525 shares of FBR & Co. (Nasdaq: FBRC), constituting approximately 5.2% of shares outstanding and making us FBR’s third-largest shareholder.  We believe FBR’s current strategy has abandoned its strengths and is destroying shareholder value and that its edge has been dulled by failed efforts to branch off into highly competitive new markets where it lacks skills or differentiation. We believe these futile efforts have decimated shareholder value and imperiled the Company’s future.  As a result, the market currently values FBR at a discount to book value, despite the fact that 84% of its tangible book is comprised of cash and investment securities – thereby implying little to no value for its entire operating business – and FBR is not meeting its own stated goals on nearly every important financial metric, such as revenue/head, revenue growth, operating margins and return on equity; and in each case it badly trails its peers on these measures.  By our analysis, FBR’s current strategy and expense structure mean that it is unlikely to ever cover its cost of capital.  As a result, FBR’s stock is worth less today than when current management was appointed in 2009.   Ultimately, we believe that FBR’s Board is responsible, and must be held accountable, for these failings.  The vast majority of the Directors possess long-standing ties to the Company and management that pre-date their Board tenure and color their objectivity and independence, in our view.
We strongly believe that FBR can be steered back to the path of true value creation under the guidance of a skilled operating team overseen by a refreshed, reinvigorated Board.  We have extensively analyzed FBR’s operations and identified meaningful opportunities for FBR to reclaim lost ground and believe we have the right strategy to correct FBR’s course, reverse its underperformance, arrest its governance failings and deliver real, lasting value for the Company’s employees, clients, and investors.
We have therefore nominated three independent, highly-qualified nominees (the “Nominees”) for election to the Board at the 2016 Annual Meeting:  Jarl Berntzen, Michael J. McConnell and J. Daniel Plants.  Our Nominees bring the right collective mix of investment banking, finance, strategy, capital allocation, corporate governance and operational experience to help lead the Board through this crucial transition.  They will seek to re-focus FBR on its historic core industry sectors, significantly reduce expenses and pursue higher margin advisory services, while reasserting appropriate corporate governance and oversight at the Company, which we feel is currently derelict.
