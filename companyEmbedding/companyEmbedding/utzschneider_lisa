Yahoo's CRO explains how she juggles being a parent with a high-profile job

  A question Yahoo chief revenue officer Lisa Utzschneider gets
  asked all the time is: How do you manage to balance your
  high-profile, high-intensity role with being a mom?

  Utzschneider is Marissa Mayer's right-hand woman, responsible for
  growing Yahoo's ad sales business. That means developing ad
  products and plans, meeting with clients, appearing on stage at
  events, and managing a giant global sales team.

  She also has a 7-year-old daughter.

  Utzschneider's tip for anyone else in a similar position of
  juggling a busy job with trying to do the best in bringing up
  their children is to "be present."

  She told Business Insider: "Personally, one of my goals is that
  my 7-year-old never asks me to put my phone down. I make such a
  concerted effort, when I’m home and I’m with her until she falls
  asleep."





  Utzschneider calls those times at home her "sacred time" and
  makes it her mission when she's in New York, no matter what, to
  get home to read to her daughter before she goes to bed.

  "It's really important to get your priorities clear and that you
  also share them so your team understands: 'Oh OK, so calling Lisa
  at 7.30 at night isn’t great, but you can call her after 8.'"

  Utzschneider says Mayer has been "incredibly supportive" in
  helping her manage her personal and professional life from "day
  one" of starting at the company in 2014. 
  Utzschneider joined from Amazon, where she was the VP of global
  advertising sales for its media group.

  "[Mayer] recognizes that different people have different
  work styles and everyone gets to the finish line a little
  differently. She does what she can to support and nourish that
  work style and she encourages me to approach the business in the
  way that I think is the right way to approach it," Utzschneider
  said. "I couldn’t say enough about her in terms of how supportive
  she has been to me in my role and also of our sales
  organization."

  But while Utzschneider is in the higher echelons of a supportive
  organization now, it hasn't always been that way during her
  career.
The 3% Movement
  recent published a survey about the gender bias and sexism
  women still experience in the ad industry — from being
  excluded from meetings, to being less well compensated than their
  male peers. We asked Utzschneider whether she had ever
  experienced anything similar.

  Early on in her career, Utzschneider used to work for companies
  on the west coast of the US, while she has always been based in
  New York, meaning she has been on lots of calls where she is
  the only woman and/or the only person dialling in remotely.

  Utzschneider said: "I remember, early in my career, forcing
  myself and pushing myself to speak up, to speak often, to make
  sure I was heard, that I was articulate, that I was contributing
  to the conversation, to make sure that if I was getting cut off I
  would call the person out on it. Or speak to them after the
  meeting and say: 'Hey, this just happened, and I ask, moving
  forward, to give me space in meetings so I can speak up'."

  She describes the technique as similar to exercise: The more you
  do it, the more you develop the muscle, and the stronger you get
  to the point where it becomes second nature.

  Utzschneider added: "I knew throughout my career if I wasn't able
  to find my voice it would be very difficult to be successful in a
  senior level job."

Amazon Media Group






“eMarketer is a great one-stop shop for the Amazon Media Group and our sales team.”
—Lisa Utzschneider
Former Vice President of Global Advertising, Amazon Media Group






An Interview with Lisa Utzschneider
Former Vice President of Global Advertising at Amazon Media Group
Lisa Utzschneider leads Amazon.com’s global display advertising efforts. She joined Amazon in September 2008, assuming responsibility for ad sales and operations for a range of Amazon-owned and -operated websites including Amazon, IMDb and Digital Photography Review. In this role, Utzschneider leads the product development and sales strategies for advertising solutions across the Amazon portfolio.
Prior to Amazon, she spent a decade at Microsoft leading a variety of advertising initiatives in product development, sales strategy and online industry standards capacities. Her last position at Microsoft was general manager of the sales and account services group.
(Editors’ note: Lisa Utzschneider was interviewed by eMarketer in January 2014; she was named Senior Vice President, Sales, Americas, Yahoo in October 2014.)
What are you responsible for as vice president of global advertising sales?
Lisa Utzschneider: I’m responsible for our global advertising business, which today consists of a few primary areas. The first is display advertising across our owned and operated sites including Amazon.com, IMDb.com, DP Review, and Diapers.com. The second is advertising on connected devices, including Kindle E-readers, Kindle Fire tablets and mobile, both IMDb’s mobile apps and the Amazon shopping app. The third is connecting with Amazon customers on the internet. And the fourth area, which I’m very excited about, is video.
Let me take a step back and provide some context. Amazon is in its 19th year of building a really robust retail platform for our customers. As a result, we’ve also built a large, loyal customer base of more than 224 million active customer accounts worldwide.
About seven years ago, we saw an exciting opportunity to help those customers find and discover new and great products through advertising on our sites, and to help advertisers discover new and relevant customers who are coming to our site in a shopping mindset.
Since then, we’ve been building our advertising platform and from the outset, maintaining an extremely high bar for the ads we show and the experiences we create. We’re always striving to ensure ads meet our customers’ expectations, while delivering meaningful results for our advertisers. It’s still early, but the advertiser response we’re seeing to date tells us it’s working.
Recently, we’re seeing positive results in integrating more video within our advertising program. We’ve just started doing this both within our ad units and through a new feature we’re calling Native Video.
What role is video playing in Amazon’s advertising across screens and devices?
Utzschneider: We want to create a compelling platform that includes video. For example, our customers like watching how-to videos to help them make purchase decisions. And we see that as a great opportunity for our marketers to meaningfully connect with Amazon customers. We launched native video in the fourth quarter of 2013 in the US.
So if I’m shopping on Amazon and I enter a search term—let’s say "Cover Girl"—I may see Cover Girl videos like "How to create a smoky eye" in the search results. Customers can watch the video, learn more about the products, how to use them, and make a more informed shopping decision. We also have the ability for customers to add the featured product to their shopping carts from right within the video. We’re adding this type of short‑form video content across other categories as well, like video game trailers and movie trailers.
What are your three biggest priorities for 2014?
Utzschneider: I’d say the first priority is global. We’re a global platform, and we focus on scale and product parity in every country we serve. We’ll continue to focus on scaling our current regions and evaluating new ones.
Right now, Amazon Media Group serves eight countries. We’ll remain focused on delivering great advertising across those regions and innovating as we grow the business. We also want to ensure the ad products we roll out are consistent country by country for our customers, and so that our global marketers can plan and buy advertising globally.
The second priority is connected devices. As I mentioned, we run advertising on Kindle E-readers, Kindle Fire tablets, and mobile. Tens of thousands of new customers make their first-ever Amazon purchase via mobile devices every day. In fact, people love shopping on a mobile device so much, millions of Amazon customers shop exclusively on a mobile device all year. That’s a tremendous opportunity to connect marketers with Amazon customers wherever they are and at every digital touchpoint.
I would say our third priority is video. It’s early days for us with video, but we see lots of opportunity to enhance both the customer and advertiser experience via video.
What are you doing with ecommerce ads?
Utzschneider: Within Amazon Media Group, we’re looking to leverage the Amazon platform in ways we feel are truly compelling for both our customers and advertisers. Our eCommerce Ads are probably the purest example of that, and we’ve been working on them for several years now.
With eCommerce Ads, we embed familiar Amazon shopping features and functionality right within the ad unit—into IAB-standard banners. That includes features like "Buy Now" or "Add to Cart," digital coupons, customer ratings and reviews, "Add to Wish List," and that list keeps growing. We’re continually iterating to both add more functionality and to learn how we can most effectively combine these different elements into a single ad unit, as well as integrating video.
For example, we have a 300x600 unit that runs on our "Thank You" page, and it can include a video, the product’s average customer star rating, and an "Add to Cart" button. We’re seeing that eCommerce Ads are performing, on average, 20% to 30% better than standard ads across key metrics.
Why are these ads performing so much better?
Utzschneider: The more we can do to make advertising helpful for customers—whether it’s helping them discover new products, accessing more product information, making it super simple for them to add a product to their shopping cart or "Wish List"—the more meaningful engagements it drives between customers and those brands.
For example, you could come to Amazon and look at an ad promoting a Pantene haircare product. Without ever leaving that page, you could watch a video of the Pantene product within the ad unit, you could see the customer rating or a review right within the ad unit, and add the product to your shopping cart—right from the ad. That’s offering our customers an easy and convenient shopping option, while helping advertisers connecting with a relevant audience.
What new ad formats are you working on that you’re excited about?
Utzschneider: I wouldn’t say we’re focused on creating new ad formats specifically, but rather on how we truly optimize the advertising experience on our sites and across devices for both customers and advertisers. The fact that customers come to Amazon in a shopping mindset—whether it’s to research products or make a purchase—makes us a little bit different in this space. And we embrace that difference. It also means we approach advertising a little differently. We strive to create advertising that helps customers discover products vs. just delivering impressions.
We want to create advertising that helps inform customers and helps advertisers connect with customers in ways that are most meaningful as they’re shopping. We believe ecommerce and advertising intersect at the customer when both are optimized to help them find, discover, and buy, so that’s where we focus. We believe that’s how we can deliver the most value for our advertisers.
Our eCommerce Ads are one example of that. Using video in different ways is another example of how we’re looking at optimizing experiences for customers and advertisers across our platform.
I can’t speak to new things we may be doing in the future, but I can say we’re also really focused on cross-screen formats, as are our advertisers. Customers expect their shopping experiences across screens to be as seamless. Similarly, marketers are looking at how to create consistent advertising experiences across devices and screens. We’ve been working with many marketers to connect them with audiences across devices, whether it’s a PC, mobile device or Kindle E-reader.
We’re finding that marketing campaigns running on at least two screens are performing, on average, 18% better across key metrics than campaigns running on a single screen. Recently, we ran a campaign for the DVD release of "Despicable Me 2." It featured eCommerce Ads and ran on Amazon.com, IMDb.com, and on the Kindle Fire tablet. The customer could view a pre-roll of the movie as well as add the DVD to their shopping cart from within the ad. They could do this from their PC, for example, and complete the purchase later on their Kindle Fire or mobile phone.
You and your team have worked with some of the world’s largest brands. What do they want most from their Amazon advertising experience?
Utzschneider: Marketers know we have a loyal and engaged customer base of over 224 million active customer accounts worldwide. Done right, the combination of that user base, plus the growth of ecommerce overall, is a tremendous opportunity for them. We work with some of the largest global marketers, and these marketers are excited to team with us to create the most meaningful engagements for Amazon customers with their brands.
Amazon prides itself on being customer-centric. What does this mean for the advertising business?
Utzschneider: We start with the customer and work backward, just as we do with everything at Amazon. We aspire to create relevant and shopping experiences for our customers, and better results for our advertisers, by delivering useful ads that help customers discover and buy the products they’re looking for.
You’ve worked in digital advertising and media for a while now. What keeps you excited about being in this business?
Utzschneider: You’re right; I’ve worked in the digital advertising space for quite some time now. At Amazon, we believe it’s day one. It’s day one for the internet, it’s day one for advertising, and we’re at the tip of the iceberg in terms of figuring out ways to create relevant, innovative experiences for our customers and advertisers. There’s so much opportunity ahead of us to be able to connect with Amazon customers from any digital touchpoint and deliver relevant and meaningful marketing experiences to them.
What do you and your team like best about eMarketer?
Utzschneider: eMarketer is a great one-stop shop for the Amazon Media Group and our sales team. With eMarketer, the team doesn’t have to scour through a lot of data to get the precise insight that they’re looking for—they can go and quickly pull the insight and get what they need. The insights and data are easy to find.
Second, it helps the team get better educated about industry trends. It’s so important for a sales team to stay up to date on what’s happening in the industry, especially our industry, because it’s evolving so quickly.
The third thing we really like about eMarketer is that it’s global. We are a global platform, and our marketers think globally. Being able to equip our sales team with global insights is really valuable for us.

                By Ronan Shields-25 September 2015 11:38amYahoo's chief revenue officer (CRO) Lisa Utzschneider is in the process of devising how best to bolster the company’s earnings, which includes working with select advertisers on pilot schemes, here she speaks with The Drum about her ambitions to monetise its rich repository of audience insights.   In just under a year since defecting from Amazon to Yahoo, Lisa Utzschneider was recently promoted from VP of sales to CRO, and now ranks as one of the chief lieutenants of chief executive Marissa Mayer. This involves putting into place its much feted MaVeNS (mobile, video, and native) revenue strategy. She takes up the reins at a crucial stage of transition for not just Yahoo, but every web-based media owner, as audiences’ media consumption fragments.   With over 43 million visitors to its media properties on a daily basis, Yahoo is one of the biggest media owners in the world, and has at its disposal swathes of audience data, according to Utzschneider. She added: “One of the first things I looked at when coming in was what kind of data do we have, how valuable it is to marketers and how can they harness it."At present, Utzschneider and company are in the process of thinking through what its data strategy should be. “The good news is that we have lots of interesting data, especially between the acquisitions of BrightRoll, Flurry and Tumblr. With those platforms there’s so much opportunity because we’ve been able to maintain the consumer trust of the Yahoo brand [with users of the three services].“So right now, we’re working very closely with our product team, and thinking we should crawl, walk and then run,” she explained.  Utzschneider claimed this involves identifying what kind of data marketers and agencies need to improve their audiences targeting and then begin experimenting with their assets in partnership.A crucial part of this strategy is helping advertisers understand how best to engage with audiences on mobile devices, given that such devices are now the primary medium of web-based media consumption.“One area we are really trying to crack is mobile. Given that we’ve acquired Flurry, we now have a pretty good picture of how consumers are now spending their time, and what they’re doing in apps. That’s an area where we’re working with marketers. We’re looking at Flurry data, and then trying to connect that with other Yahoo data,” she explains.  In addition, Yahoo is also in the process of helping advertisers understand how best to synchronise their mobile advertising executions with those on desktop - an equivalent to Facebook’s Social Graph, or Google’s Device Graph.  Utzschneider added: “The cross-device story is something we’re still working on, it’s really difficult to get that right. I’m a big believer in getting two screens right first [before trying to get things cross-screen]. So starting with the desktop, and then focusing on tablets, but we are starting to experiment with cross-device capabilities.”   This article is about: World, Digital Advertising, MediaShare to TwitterShare to LinkedInShare to FacebookGet the NewsletterKeep up to date with the latest news and insights.SubscribeRonan ShieldsI'm the digital editor at The Drum, and cover adtech and martech.
