The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Davidson Kempner Capital Management LP


                  Davidson Kempner Capital Management (DKCM) invests client assets using a variety of arbitrage and other event-driven strategies, including “risk” arbitrage transactions and investments in financially distressed companies. The firm's primary investment strategies include distressed investing; mergers and acquisitions (or “risk”) arbitrage; long/short equities; and convertible and volatility arbitrage.DKCM's distressed investments strategy involves investing in securities or other financial instruments of stressed or distressed companies undergoing liquidation, restructuring, refinancing pressures or substantial litigation. As these opportunities are identified, they are subjected to rigorous, fundamental, bottom up analysis. This analysis evaluates legal, financial, regulatory, litigation and timing issues. The firm's merger arbitrage strategy involves investing in securities with an announced hard catalyst and a clearly defined risk/return trade profile. These catalysts include announced merger or takeover offers (friendly and unsolicited), tender offers, auctions, exchange offers, spin-offs, re-capitalizations and legal/regulatory events. DKCM analyzes the business conditions of the company and processes the surrounding the event to determine how the anticipated outcome of the event may affect the trading prices of the company’s securities. DKCM then seeks to purchase these securities at a discount to what they believe their value will be following the event.DKCM's long/short equities strategy involves investing in: long positions that they  believe areundervalued by the market relative to their intrinsic or fundamental value and trade at a discount to such value and short positions they believe are fundamentally overvalued by the market and trade at a premium to fair value.DCKM's convertible and volatility arbitrage strategy encompasses traditional convertible bond arbitrage, as well as opportunistic relative value volatility trades.
