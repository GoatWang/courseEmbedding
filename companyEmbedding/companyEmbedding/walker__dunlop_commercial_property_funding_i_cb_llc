What Makes WD a Compelling Investment

- Walker & Dunlop provides a broad range of financing solutions for 
            every type of commercial real estate asset, including short term bridge 
            financing as well as investment sales services for 
            multifamily properties. Over the next three years, at least $300 billion of 
            multifamily financing volume is forecasted for each year, and Walker 
            & Dunlop's national scale and reputation positions it well to capitalize on this growing market opportunity.


- Walker & Dunlop has impressive scale and market presence in the multifamily 
            space and has steadily grown its market share with Fannie Mae & Freddie 
            Mac, the two largest providers of capital to the multifamily market; 
            from 2012 to 2016, Walker & Dunlop increased its market share from 9.5% 
            to 10.8% and 4.6% to 10.4% with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac respectively. 
            Walker & Dunlop is the #2 Fannie Mae DUS® Lender, #3 Freddie Mac Multifamily Approved Seller, and the #4 Multifamily HUD Lender in the country.
- A large servicing portfolio provides a stable and durable source of 
            cash flow and income, ensuring financial flexibility. As of March 31, 2017, 86% of the servicing fees were protected from the risk prepayment.
- Walker & Dunlop ended 2016 with nearly $119 million 
            in cash and plans to deploy its capital to grow its interim loan 
            portfolio, expand its headcount of loan origination and investment sales professionals throughout 
            the country, repurchase shares in accordance with its share buyback plan, and fund acquisitions that will promote long-term growth.
- In April, 2017, Walker & Dunlop entered a joint venture with Blackstone Mortgage Trust to originate, hold, and finance multifamily bridge loans. Walker & Dunlop's 15% stake in the partnership will allow the Company to expand its bridge lending capacity, further tapping into a $20 billion addressable market.
- Walker & Dunlop has a strong track record of growth and an experienced 
            management team fully aligned to drive shareholder value.

Walker & Dunlop Launches CMBS and High Yield Lending Platform

BETHESDA, Md., Nov. 6, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Walker & Dunlop, Inc. (NYSE:   WD) ("the Company") announced today that it has entered into a joint venture with an affiliate of a fund managed by Fortress Investment Group (NYSE:   FIG) to form a CMBS lending platform to provide financing for multifamily and commercial real estate properties nationwide. The venture, to be named Walker & Dunlop Commercial Property Funding, LLC, will provide first mortgage loans on all commercial property types. In addition, the venture will originate high yield whole loans, mezzanine debt, and preferred equity. The joint venture will be headquartered in New York City and overseen by Tim Koltermann, a 25-year industry veteran in commercial loan originations, CMBS trading, loan pricing and structuring, and CMBS securitization. 
"Walker & Dunlop finished 2012 as the 10th largest commercial real estate lender in the United States and third largest multifamily lender as a major partner to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD," commented Willy Walker, Walker & Dunlop's Chairman and CEO. "This new initiative with Fortress Investment Group allows us to leverage our scaled origination, underwriting, servicing and asset management infrastructure to offer an alternative capital source for all commercial real estate asset classes. Over the past year, Walker & Dunlop has expanded to 20 offices across the country, and this new venture will provide our clients with a significantly diversified proprietary lending platform to meet their financing objectives." 
Jeff Goodman, EVP of Walker & Dunlop's proprietary capital group, commented, "We raised Walker & Dunlop's first large-scale, institutionally-backed debt vehicle in August focused on multifamily and seniors housing bridge loans, and have been deploying that capital ever since. The addition of this CMBS and high yield platform, under Tim Koltermann's leadership and in partnership with Fortress, is a terrific step in the continued expansion of Walker & Dunlop's product lines. We expect to issue loan applications as early as January, 2014, and are projecting an initial origination target of $1 billion in the first year of operation."

Mitch Resnick, managing director, Walker & Dunlop Commercial Property Funding
Bethesda, Md.—Walker & Dunlop (W&D) recently recruited veteran Mitch Resnick, former Freddie Mac and Goldman Sachs VP, as managing director of Walker & Dunlop Commercial Property Funding LLC (WDCPF), the company’s CMBS lending platform. He will join the company in late April, overseeing WDCPF’s capital markets executions with responsibility over pricing, hedging, securitizations, and investor relations.
Resnick joined Freddie Mac in November 2011, and during his four and a half years with the enterprise, served as vice president of capital markets, managing the K-deal and other securitization programs. W&D has contributed more than $13 billion of loans into Freddie Mac K-Series securitizations since 2009, working closely with Resnick and his capital markets team. Prior to that role, he spent nearly 15 years with Goldman Sachs, serving as vice president within the firm’s real estate finance group.
Resnick holds a Bachelor of Science in finance and financial management services from the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated in 1994.
“In January, we brought Bob Restrick on board to lead our CMBS team, and Mitch’s arrival significantly enhances the depth and expertise inside this lending platform,” said Willy Walker, chairman & CEO of W&D, in prepared remarks. “Mitch will add significant long-term value to our CMBS platform and company,” added Bob Restrick, WDCPF’s recently appointed CEO.
