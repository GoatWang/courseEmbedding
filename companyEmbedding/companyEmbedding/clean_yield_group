Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

Our Services






Portfolio Management
Each client works with a single portfolio manager, but our full team of managers consults on each account. Portfolio managers Eric Becker and Elizabeth Glenshaw are based in our main office in Norwich, Vermont. Dorigen Hofmann works from Washington, D.C.
We tailor your portfolio to your tax situation as well as to particular circumstances, such as your current stock and bond holdings, your cash requirements, and your retirement and estate plans. At your request, we can work directly with other professionals, such as your financial planner or accountant.

Our usual minimum account size is $1,000,000. This may be met by adding separate portfolios within a single family.
Meet our staff.
Screening
In addition to evaluating potential investments on their financial characteristics and prospects, we integrate ESG (environmental, social and governance) information into our decision-making process.
We eliminate from client portfolios companies that are materially engaged in nuclear power, fossil fuel extraction and refining, genetically modified seed production, gambling, tobacco, weapons manufacturing, hydraulic fracturing, human rights abuses, and other activities that are socially harmful. In this vein, we avoid U.S. Treasury securities because of the weapons expenditures that they fund.
We seek out companies with positive environmental and social records, strong employee relations throughout the supply chain, and a demonstrable commitment to diversity and the advancement of women. See Environmental and Social Screens for a more complete description.
Impact Investing
We are ardent believers in high-impact investment vehicles such as community loan funds and direct private placements, and we make these investments available to our clients when appropriate. “Impact vehicles” vary widely with respect to economic focus (such as affordable housing, microbusinesses, or green infrastructure bonds), geographic focus, and investment characteristics. As always, we seek to find investments that match your interests, values, and financial goals. See Impact Investing for more information.
Alternative Investing
We can discuss with you opportunities to invest in high-social-impact businesses that are not traded on the regular stock exchanges. These often carry relatively high financial risk. An example: a small Vermont company that produces organic garden seeds.
Proxy Voting
Clients can authorize Clean Yield to vote their proxies. Clean Yield has contracted with an outside company that will execute clients’ votes according to our Proxy Voting Guidelines. Our 2016 proxy votes can be found here.
Shareholder Activism
We frequently engage with companies on a wide range of social and environmental sustainability challenges, from corporate political contributions to climate change.
The “toolkit” for shareholder activism includes dialogue with corporate management, the filing of shareholder resolutions, attendance  stockholder meetings, and adding our voice as shareholders to the public conversation through articles, press releases, legislative testimony and other means. See Shareholder Advocacy for more detail.

About






Our History
Our founders, Doug Fleer and Rian Fried, first met at a neighborhood gathering in 1983. The two found that they had strong common interests in social justice, the environment, and financial markets. Within a few months, they formed Fried & Fleer Investments and began publishing a monthly stock-market newsletter that they called The Clean Yield. That publication featured a list of socially screened companies, as well as a model portfolio. With its unique content, The Clean Yield quickly developed a nationwide following among financial professionals as well as individual investors just learning about the emerging field of socially responsible investing.
The Clean Yield’s model portfolio, in particular, drew attention, because it became one of the top-performing model portfolios in the U.S. Before long, subscribers began calling to ask for market trading advice. Seeing the need, Doug and Rian joined up with a third partner, Ben Lovell, and made their advice systematic by adding an asset management service. Clean Yield Asset Management incorporated as a registered investment advisory firm in 1986, and Ben opened a branch office in Portsmouth, N.H.
For a while, the Portsmouth Clean Yield office was co-located with the social mutual fund, Pax World Fund, and our staff performed many of Pax World’s administrative functions through contractual arrangement. When Ben switched jobs in 1996, we took the opportunity to consolidate his office and our office in Stannard, Vermont, in a nearby town, Greensboro.
Another staff addition came in 2006 with the addition of Dorigen Hofmann, a portfolio manager. Dorigen maintained a small office near her home in Seattle; however, in the spring of 2009, she opened a satellite office in Washington, DC. Portfolio manager Eric Becker joined us in October 2009 as our chief investment officer and Elizabeth Glenshaw came on board as managing director at the beginning of 2010. Eric was seasoned for sixteen years as a portfolio manager at Trillium Asset Management in Boston, and Elizabeth most recently directed a development team at the Calvert Foundation.
Rick Hausman started with us part time in 1990 as our research director while he was still in his third term in the Vermont House. His presence enabled us to expand our social research, shareholder advocacy, and community investing, work assumed by Shelley Alpern upon Rick’s retirement in 2012. Shelley joined us after many years in social research and advocacy with Trillium Asset Management.
Clean Yield became a B Corp in April 2011.
In 2013, we welcomed Steve Lehman in the role of equity analyst and Karin Chamberlain as Impact and Community Investment Analyst. Steve brings many years of experience managing individual portfolios and a mutual fund. Karin’s background as a manager of sustainability indices at KLD Research & Analytics was preceded by service with the US Peace Corps. (Bios for our staff can be found here.)
In July 2013, we were deeply saddened by the loss of Rian Fried. We are committed to keeping his legacy of innovation alive and keeping Clean Yield true to the ideals he cherished.

Investment Style






Clean Yield Asset Management takes a long-term approach to investing, favoring high-quality holdings and diversified portfolios to limit risk.
Equities
Our approach to the stock market is to focus on individual companies, while considering economic sector trends and monetary, economic, and geopolitical developments in the U.S. and around the world. We seek stocks that are undervalued relative to the cash that a company generates, especially cash in excess of the company’s ordinary business needs. We also favor high-quality companies in strong financial shape that have a record of consistent earnings and dividends. We particularly favor those that are well managed, with robust profit margins and an emphasis on sustainability. We believe that companies with top managers that adhere to high standards of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) performance will be industry and stock market leaders.

We take a long-term approach but are aware that things do change, sometimes rapidly. We typically sell a stock when its long-term business prospects decline, its stock becomes substantially overvalued, its ESG profile deteriorates significantly, or we find more compelling investment ideas. We trim large holdings as a matter of prudence—within capital gains tax constraints—to reduce a portfolio’s risk.
We employ four equity portfolio strategies: core, equity income, aggressive, and sustainable solutions. We work closely with our clients to determine which of these is the best fit for their goals and risk profiles. We can also adjust these strategies to accommodate individual clients’ social and financial interests.
Bonds
For balanced accounts, we buy investment-grade bonds and typically ladder maturities to reduce the risk that interest rates might be unattractively low when bonds mature and need to be reinvested. Given the historically low interest rates of recent years, we generally have limited bond maturities to several years out in anticipation of more normal (higher) rates in the years ahead.
Cash
Finally, we usually maintain cash reserves of 5-15% in our portfolios. Though we’re not “market timers” who jump into and out of markets, there are times when conditions are extraordinarily favorable or unfavorable. This is a business of probabilities, not certainties, and when market prices are substantially above long-term norms (reducing likely future returns), we will build up cash reserves toward the high end of the range so that when more favorable opportunities arise, we will have the means to take advantage of them.
Impact Investments
When appropriate for a client’s risk profile, we offer a variety of impact investments as part of portfolios. These investments typically make up 1-5% of an account and range from community investment notes to private equity and debt offerings of small food and agriculture businesses.
