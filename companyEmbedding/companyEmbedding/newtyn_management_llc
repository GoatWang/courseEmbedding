Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

NEW YORK, July 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Newtyn Management LLC, who, together with its affiliates and the other participants in its solicitation (collectively, "Newtyn"), beneficially owns approximately 8.9% of the outstanding shares of common stock of CSW Industrials, Inc. (NASDAQ:    CSWI) ("CSWI" or the "Company"), announced today that it has filed preliminary proxy materials seeking the election of a highly-qualified director nominee, Yevgeny Neginsky, to the CSWI Board of Directors (the "Board") at the upcoming 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting").  Newtyn urges stockholders of the Company to STOP, LOOK and LISTEN before taking any action in response to the Company's solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting and to wait until they receive Newtyn's proxy materials and WHITE proxy card before voting.  








Newtyn issued the following statement to CSWI stockholders:
"You may have already received a proxy statement and proxy card from CSWI.  We strongly urge you not to return the Company's proxy card or voting instruction form and not to allow CSWI to take your vote over the telephone. We encourage you to wait until you receive Newtyn's proxy statement and WHITE proxy card before voting.  If you have already voted the Company's proxy card or voting instruction form or had your vote taken over the telephone, a later-dated WHITE proxy card will revoke your previously cast vote.  
Newtyn is seeking to add our highly qualified director nominee – Yevgeny Neginsky – to the Company's Board because we believe that the Company's value potential is not being realized under the direction of the current Board and management team and that stockholder representation is required in order to ensure the best interests of stockholders are more appropriately represented in the CSWI boardroom.  
We firmly believe that CSWI is in urgent need of a stockholder-focused representative who is committed to enhancing long-term stockholder value. You will be able to vote FOR Newtyn's nominee only on our WHITE proxy card. So we urge you to WAIT for and read Newtyn's proxy solicitation materials before you vote or return a proxy.
In addition to having relevant business and financial experience, Mr. Neginsky is a significant stockholder of CSWI.  We believe Mr. Neginsky, if elected, will bring a fresh perspective into the boardroom and will be invaluable in assessing and executing on initiatives to unlock value at the Company. Further, we believe CSWI's depressed valuation under the oversight of the Board coupled with the Board's questionable approach to capital allocation warrants the addition of a director whose interests is closely aligned with those of all stockholders, and who will work constructively with the other members of the Board to protect the best interests of CSWI stockholders."
Newtyn's Highly Qualified Director Nominee:
Yevgeny Neginsky has served as the portfolio manager and Managing Member of Springdale Capital, LLC ("Springdale") since 2009. Prior to founding Springdale, Yevgeny was an investment analyst at Tyndall Management, LLC. Previously, Mr. Neginsky worked at Horsley Bridge Partners where he was part of the investment team overseeing investments in venture capital and private equity funds. Mr. Neginsky received his MBA from The Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth and a Bachelor of Arts, Summa Cum Laude, from Dartmouth College.
We urge stockholders not to return the Company's proxy card or voting instruction form and not to allow CSWI to take their vote over the telephone. If any stockholders have already voted the Company's proxy card or voting instruction form or had their vote recorded over the telephone, returning a later dated WHITE proxy card or WHITE voting instruction form will revoke your previously cast vote.
Who Should Stockholders Contact for More Information?
Newtyn's proxy solicitor is Okapi Partners.  If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact Okapi Partners at the phone numbers or email listed below:

 Educational Background



 
Class of 2005 


New York University

                  Founded in 1831, New York University is now one of the largest private universities in the United States. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and universities in America, New York University is one of only 60 member institutions of the distinguished Association of American Universities.

From a student body of 158 during NYU's very first semester, enrollment has grown to more than 40,000 students attending 18 schools and colleges at five major centers in Manhattan and in sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. Today, students come from every state in the union and from 133 foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of fourteen professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 3,100 full-time members whose research and teaching encompasses the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences; the law; medicine; business; education; the fine arts, studio art, and the performing and cinematic arts; music; social work; public administration; the ancient world; and continuing and professional studies. With more than 2,500 courses offered, the University awards more than 25 different degrees.  Although overall the University is large, the individuals schools and colleges are small- to moderate-sized units—each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty – and there are many communities to be found within the NYU community based on interests, activities, and shared experiences.

The center of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. One of the city's most creative and energetic communities, the Village is a historic neighborhood that has attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals. NYU, in keeping with its founder’s vision, is “in and of the city”: the University – which has no walls and no gates – is deeply intertwined with New York City, drawing inspiration from its vitality.

In addition to its Manhattan locations, the University is also formally affiliated the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in Brooklyn, the second oldest school of engineering and technology in the country, and has research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine,  in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York.

And NYU has established itself as the first global network university, with a comprehensive liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi – the first to be operated abroad by a major U.S. research university – and other sites for study and research in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; and Tel Aviv, Israel, among other locations.                





 Career History

                                    2011 - Current                


Newtyn Management LLC


                  Newtyn Management seeks higher-than-average appreciation in the value of their funds' assets, relative to the level of risk, by strategically investing and trading primarily in public company securities, with certain limited trading in futures and other derivatives. The funds pursue their objective by carefully selecting securities for purchase and by managing the portfolios overall degree of market exposure. The funds may hold both long and short positions in its chosen investments and may employ leverage at such times deemed appropriate by Newtyn. The funds' focus is on investment selection rather than market timing. The funds' net long position is expected to have low market exposure, reflecting the risk-averse nature of Newtyn's style. The funds may maintain a net long or short position, at the sole discretion of Newtyn. The exposure at any time will be idea-driven; i.e., gross exposure will be higher when Newtyn finds more attractive opportunities and lower when there are fewer opportunities.Newtyn believes that from time to time the securities markets misprice certain special situations which offer unusual profit opportunities. This includes a number of opportunities including spin-offs, post bankruptcy reorganizations, demutualizations, privatizations, index deletions, rights offerings and unusual corporate structures. Though the funds primarily focus on special situations, they also invest in other securities that do not fall into any of the above categories.While the funds intend to invest primarily in public company securities, with certain limited trading in futures and other derivatives, they may express their investment strategy through investments in other securities, instruments or interests of every type and description.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
