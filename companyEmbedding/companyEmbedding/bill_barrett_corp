Operations - Bill Barrett Corporation




























































































 





Operations













Bill Barrett Corporation’s portfolio of properties is primarily focused on two core development programs in the DJ Basin and Uinta Basin that support long-term, lower-risk oil development. These core programs offer a large drilling inventory with substantial growth potential. We operate these assets with high working interests to maintain operational control and execute with a focus on increasing operating efficiencies to reduce costs and employing our technical expertise to improve results.  More information on these properties can be found below.


 



Denver-Julesburg “DJ” Basin
Our acreage position in the Northeast Wattenberg Field of the DJ Basin is located predominantly in the eastern plains of Colorado and parts of southeastern Wyoming.  We initiated our position with an acquisition in July 2011 and followed it up with an additional acquisition in July 2012, which established a sizable acreage position.  Activity in the basin is directed at developing our large, contiguous acreage position through horizontal drilling of the Niobrara and Codell formations.  Through the application of horizontal technology in an area with a known resource base and existing production, the Company seeks to delineate a new, long-term development program.

Focused on the development of oil and natural gas assets located in the DJ Basin of Colorado and the Uinta Basin of Utah.

 



Bill Barrett Corporation was formed in January 2002 by a management team who had already worked together for more than a decade at a successful predecessor company. In December 2004, our company completed its initial public offering and trades on the NYSE under the symbol BBG.
Our experienced operational team has built our asset portfolio through a combination of acquisitions and exploration focusing on the areas where we have established experience and expertise. The Company’s assets and operations consist of contiguous acreage positions located in the Rocky Mountain region where the Company has a focused portfolio consisting of key assets in the DJ (Colorado, Wyoming) and the Uinta (Utah) Basins.
We have demonstrated execution of our focused operational and financial strategy. Our focus on cost structure improvement has translated into peer leading operating margins and we are positioned to deliver a competitive growth profile, while retaining the financial flexibility to fund our growth activity.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Company Overview

Considering peers, relative outperformance over the last year and the last month suggest a leading position.


Bill Barrett Corporation trades at a lower Price/Book multiple (1.08) than its peer median (1.43).


BBG-US‘s EBITDA-based price multiple implies slower growth than its peers. The market also seems to expect the company’s currently median rates of EBITDA-based return to decline.


BBG-US‘s relatively high profit margins are burdened by relative asset inefficiency.


Compared with its chosen peers, the company’s annual revenues and earnings change at a slower rate, implying a lack of strategic focus and/or lack of execution success.


BBG-US‘s return on assets currently and over the past five years suggest that its relatively high operating returns are sustainable.


The company’s median gross margin and relatively high pre-tax margins suggest non-differentiated product portfolio but with tight cost control relative to peers.


BBG-US‘s revenues have grown more slowly than the peer median over the last few years, which combined with the stock price’s relatively low Price/EBITDA ratio suggests substandard growth expectations relative to peers.


The company’s level of capital investment is relatively low and suggests it is milking the business.


BBG-US seems too levered to raise additional debt.

Leverage & Liquidity
BBG-US would seem to have a hard time raising additional debt.

With debt at a relatively high 84.59% of its enterprise value compared to an overall benchmark of 25% (Note: The peer median is currently 39.85%), and relatively tight interest coverage level of -1.74x, BBG-US would have a hard time raising much additional debt. The company has a Constrained profile in terms of its ability to take on further debt.


Of the 10 chosen peers for the company, only 9 of the stocks have an outstanding debt balance. Companies with no debt include UPLMQ-US.

BBG-US has maintained its Limited Flexibility profile from the recent year-end.

BBG-US‘s interest coverage is similar to last year’s low of -1.98x, which compares to the 2011 high of 2.32x.


Compared to 2015, interest coverage has remained relatively stable for both the company (-1.74x) and the peer median (-1.42x).


BBG-US‘s debt-EV has declined 19.65 percentage points from last year’s high but remains above its five-year average debt-EV of 64.55.


The decrease in its debt-EV to 84.59% from 104.24% (in 2015) was also accompanied by a decrease in its peer median during this period to 39.85% from 72.45%.


Relative to peers, debt-EV rose 12.96 percentage points.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
