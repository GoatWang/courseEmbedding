Ivan Seidenberg - Wikipedia






















 






Ivan Seidenberg

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Ivan Seidenberg (Jim Wallace, 2001)


Ivan Seidenberg (born December 10, 1946) is the former chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications Inc.
His telecommunications career began more than 40 years ago when he joined New York Telephone, one of Verizon’s predecessor companies, as a cable splicer. He went on to lead Verizon from its inception in 2000, first as co-Chief Executive Officer, then as sole CEO, and then as CEO and chairman. He transformed Verizon into a premier global network company by building a nationwide wireless network, deploying high-speed fiber broadband direct to homes, and expanding Verizon’s global Internet backbone network around the world.
Seidenberg stepped down as CEO in July 2011 and continued to serve as chairman and as a member of the Verizon Board of Directors through December 2011 when he retired from the company. Effective Aug. 1, 2011, Lowell McAdam, former President and COO of Verizon Communications, succeeded Seidenberg as CEO.
Previously, Seidenberg was chairman and CEO of Verizon’s predecessor companies, NYNEX and Bell Atlantic.

Early life[edit]
Born into a Jewish family,[1] Seidenberg began his career in telecommunications as a cable splicer straight from high school. He was wounded in Vietnam, and subsequently earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Lehman College, part of the City University of New York, and an MBA from Pace University.[2]
Career[edit]
Seidenberg started his career as a cable splicer at New York Telephone, eventually becoming head of NYNEX in 1994. He took a senior position in Bell Atlantic after that company merged with NYNEX. When Bell Atlantic became Verizon, Seidenberg was sole CEO of the company.[3]
In 2006, Seidenberg donated $15 million to Pace University. Pace’s School of Computer Science and Information Systems was officially renamed the Ivan G. Seidenberg School of Computer Science and Information Systems.
In 2007, President George W. Bush named Seidenberg to the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee,[4] which advises the president on communications issues related to national security, emergency preparedness and the protection of critical infrastructure.
Seidenberg is a member of the President’s Export Council, which advises the President on how to promote U.S. exports, jobs and growth, and the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, which provides counsel on communications issues related to national security. From 2009 to 2011, he chaired the Business Roundtable, an influential association of CEOs of leading U.S. companies.
Seidenberg is also a member of the New York Academy of Sciences’ President's Council and serves on the board of trustees of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital, The New York Hall of Science, Pace University, the Paley Center for Media, and on the Board of Directors of BlackRock Inc.
In 2012, Seidenberg joined Perella Weinberg Partners, a premier boutique investment banking firm, as an advisory partner.
In 2015, Seidenberg joined the Board of Directors of Afiniti, a US based unicorn big data business. [5]
Seidenberg continues his involvement in wireless communication technology businesses as a member of Ingenu's board of directors.
As of 2015, Seidenberg is also a part-owner of the New York Mets baseball franchise.
Compensation[edit]
While CEO of Verizon in 2009, Seidenberg earned a total compensation of $17,012,407, which included a base salary of $2,100,000, a cash bonus of $2,953,125, stocks granted of $11,079,000, no options granted, and other compensation of $880,282.[6]
Controversy[edit]
On October 14, 2008 Ivan Seidenberg stated as reported in the WSJ: "Verizon CEO No Bailout for Me, Thanks,"[7] Seidenberg clearly indicated that Verizon was in great shape and would not take any TARP money. Despite subsequent allegations and reports to the contrary, Verizon did not take TARP money. The Federal Reserve Bank bought $1.5 billion of Verizon's short term (90 days)[8] commercial paper. The funds for the purchase of the short term IOUs, from several corporations, did not come from the TARP program.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Seidenberg and his wife, Phyllis, have two adult children and reside in the New York City suburbs.[4]

The Olympus PEN E-P3: Making Cameras Fun Again












The board of directors of Verizon Communications has promoted COO Lowell McAdam to president and CEO of the company. Ivan Seidenberg will step down from the CEO role at the end of this month, completing a CEO succession plan that has been under way since last year. 
Seidenberg has led Verizon since its inception, first as co-CEO in 2000, then as sole chief exec since 2002 and as chairman of the board since 2004. He will remain chairman to ‘facilitate the transition’.
McAdam has been a member of Verizon’s executive leadership team since 2000 and COO over the last 10 months. He was president and CEO of Verizon Wireless until September 2010.
As the company’s head honcho, he will be responsible for all business operations at Verizon, including the strategic direction of its products and technologies. 
The company this morning also reported net income of 57 cents per share in Q2 2011, compared with a second-quarter 2010 loss of 42 cents per share, topping estimates.
Verizon’s total operating revenues were $27.5 billion in Q2 2011, an increase of 2.8 percent compared with the same period last year. 
Since the company began offering the iPhone in February, Verizon has activated 2.3 million iPhone 4 units and 1.2 million 4G LTE devices.

"Diversity is not a game of quotas or headcounts. It's a broadening of the corporate vision to encompass a wider and more varied employee and customerbase. My responsibility as CEO is to establish values, set the cultural tone within the company and keep diversity in front of all employees. When diversity is part of a company's culture, as it is at Verizon, everyone benefits, including customers, suppliers and employees."  
 
Ivan G. Seidenberg
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
            Verizon Communications
Ivan Seidenberg is chairman of the Board and chief executive officer for Verizon. In November of 2003, Verizon announced that Mr. Seidenberg would become chairman of the Board effective January 1, 2004. He has served as the sole CEO since April 1, 2002.
As chief executive of Bell Atlantic, and previously of NYNEX, Ivan Seidenberg was instrumental in reshaping the communications industry through two of the largest mergers in its history: the merger of Bell Atlantic and NYNEX in 1997 and the Bell Atlantic merger with GTE in 2000. He also led efforts in September 1999 to form Verizon Wireless, the nation’s largest cellular business composed of the wireless assets of Bell Atlantic, GTE and Vodafone Airtouch.
Mr. Seidenberg began his communications career more than 38 years ago as a cable splicer’s assistant. His career has encompassed numerous operations and engineering assignments, including various leadership positions at AT&T and NYNEX.
He has a long-standing commitment to education and is a strong proponent of connecting students and teachers to technology. He championed a special rate for schools and libraries to connect to the Internet.
Mr. Seidenberg also champions diversity both within and outside the company. Under his leadership, the company has made great strides in increasing minority employment and initiated a partnership with the U.S. Small Business Administration to increase the company’s purchasing from minority suppliers.
Verizon’s commitment to diversity has been widely recognized, with the company being cited by Fortune magazine in its list of “The 50 Best Companies for Minorities.” It has been the recipient of numerous awards for its diversity efforts from such organizations as Diversity, Inc., National Society of Black Engineers, Latina Style Magazine, and the US Pan Asian American Chamber of Commerce.
Mr. Seidenberg earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics from City University of New York and a master’s degree in business administration and marketing from Pace University.
He and his wife, Phyllis, have two adult children and reside in New York.

	It certainly doesn't come as the biggest of surprises, but Verizon confirmed today that its current CEO, Lowell McAdam, will succeed its former CEO, Ivan Seidenberg, as Chairman when the latter retires on December 31st. McAdam, as you may recall, took over as CEO when Seidenberg stepped down from the position in July of this year, with Seidenberg remaining on as Chairman at that point to aid in the transition, which has apparently gone just as planned. In related news, the carrier also announced today that Melanie L. Healey of Proctor & Gamble will be immediately joining the board, which will stand at twelve members following Seidenberg's departure. Head on past the break for the official press release.

Healey, P&G Group President, Joins Board 		McAdam Will Be Chairman and CEO Following Ivan Seidenberg's Retirement as Chairman at Year-End 		NEW YORK – December 1, 2011 –		The Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq:VZ) today elected Verizon President and CEO Lowell C. McAdam as chairman, effective Jan. 1, 2012. In addition, Melanie L. Healey, group president for North America at Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE:PG), was elected as a new member of Verizon's board, effective immediately. 		McAdam's chairmanship will begin following the retirement of Ivan G. Seidenberg as Verizon's chairman on Dec. 31. 		Sandra O. Moose, presiding director of Verizon's board, said: "The board's decision to name Lowell as chairman is a reflection of his comprehensive understanding of Verizon's operations and the fast-moving and ever-evolving communications industry. He is uniquely qualified to step into this role, having spent his entire career as an industry leader creating growth and value for shareholders. As chairman, Lowell will provide insight and expertise as he oversees the functioning of the board." 		McAdam has been president and CEO of Verizon since Aug. 1, with responsibility for all business operations at Verizon, including the strategic direction of the company's products and technologies. He has served on the board of Verizon since March 2011 and on the board of Verizon Wireless since 2003, chairing the Verizon Wireless board since September 2010. He was president and CEO of Verizon Wireless until October 2010, when he became president and COO of Verizon. 		Healey, a Recognized Global Marketing Leader 		Healey serves as group president for North America at Procter & Gamble. Before this, she had been president of P&G's global feminine care business since 2005, adding responsibilities for global health care brands in 2007. 		Moose said: "Melanie brings to Verizon's board an extensive background in consumer goods, marketing and international operations. With first-hand experience in several global markets and a wealth of knowledge about delighting consumers with great products, she will be a superb advisor and asset to Verizon. We look forward to her active participation on the board." 		Brazilian by birth, Healey began her career in marketing at S.C. Johnson & Sons in 1983 and moved to Johnson & Johnson in 1987. 		She joined P&G Brazil as a brand manager in 1990 and over the next eight years managed brands across categories as diverse as baby care, health care, hair care, personal cleansing and fabric care during assignments in Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela. In 1998 she was named general manager of the feminine care business in Latin America. In 2001 she became vice president and general manager of the feminine care business for North America, moving to P&G's headquarters in Cincinnati. 		In addition to her current business responsibilities, Healey is the leader of P&G North America's Diversity and Inclusion Team, as well as the Global Corporate Women's Leadership Team. She serves as a member of Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport Board, and she has been a director of Bacardi & Co. Limited since 2008. 		Since 2007, she has been recognized in multiple business-leadership lists, including Fortune magazine's Top 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, Forbes magazine's The 100 Most Powerful Women and the Wall Street Journal's The 50 Women to Watch. 		Healey has a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Richmond, where she is a member of the Board of Trustees. 		Seidenberg Completes Leadership Succession Plan 		Seidenberg, who turns 65 this month, had previously announced his intention to retire by year-end, after stepping down from the CEO post earlier this year and completing the company's CEO succession process under way since 2010. As chairman, Seidenberg has continued to assist in the transition. 		Following Seidenberg's retirement, Verizon will have 12 board members. 		Verizon Communications Inc.

Ivan Seidenberg

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Ivan Seidenberg (Jim Wallace, 2001)


Ivan Seidenberg (born December 10, 1946) is the former chairman and CEO of Verizon Communications Inc.
His telecommunications career began more than 40 years ago when he joined New York Telephone, one of Verizon’s predecessor companies, as a cable splicer. He went on to lead Verizon from its inception in 2000, first as co-Chief Executive Officer, then as sole CEO, and then as CEO and chairman. He transformed Verizon into a premier global network company by building a nationwide wireless network, deploying high-speed fiber broadband direct to homes, and expanding Verizon’s global Internet backbone network around the world.
Seidenberg stepped down as CEO in July 2011 and continued to serve as chairman and as a member of the Verizon Board of Directors through December 2011 when he retired from the company. Effective Aug. 1, 2011, Lowell McAdam, former President and COO of Verizon Communications, succeeded Seidenberg as CEO.
Previously, Seidenberg was chairman and CEO of Verizon’s predecessor companies, NYNEX and Bell Atlantic.

Early life[edit]
Born into a Jewish family,[1] Seidenberg began his career in telecommunications as a cable splicer straight from high school. He was wounded in Vietnam, and subsequently earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Lehman College, part of the City University of New York, and an MBA from Pace University.[2]
Career[edit]

Controversy[edit]
On October 14, 2008 Ivan Seidenberg stated as reported in the WSJ: "Verizon CEO No Bailout for Me, Thanks,"[7] Seidenberg clearly indicated that Verizon was in great shape and would not take any TARP money. Despite subsequent allegations and reports to the contrary, Verizon did not take TARP money. The Federal Reserve Bank bought $1.5 billion of Verizon's short term (90 days)[8] commercial paper. The funds for the purchase of the short term IOUs, from several corporations, did not come from the TARP program.[9]

From 2009 to 2011, he chaired the Business Roundtable, an influential association of CEOs of leading U.S. companies.
Seidenberg is also a member of the New York Academy of Sciences’ President's Council and serves on the board of trustees of the New York-Presbyterian Hospital, The New York Hall of Science, Pace University, the Paley Center for Media, and on the Board of Directors of BlackRock Inc.
In 2012, Seidenberg joined Perella Weinberg Partners, a premier boutique investment banking firm, as an advisory partner.
In 2015, Seidenberg joined the Board of Directors of Afiniti, a US based unicorn big data business. [5]
Seidenberg continues his involvement in wireless communication technology businesses as a member of Ingenu's board of directors.
As of 2015, Seidenberg is also a part-owner of the New York Mets baseball franchise.
Compensation[edit]
While CEO of Verizon in 2009, Seidenberg earned a total compensation of $17,012,407, which included a base salary of $2,100,000, a cash bonus of $2,953,125, stocks granted of $11,079,000, no options granted, and other compensation of $880,282.[6]
Controversy[edit]
On October 14, 2008 Ivan Seidenberg stated as reported in the WSJ: "Verizon CEO No Bailout for Me, Thanks,"[7] Seidenberg clearly indicated that Verizon was in great shape and would not take any TARP money. Despite subsequent allegations and reports to the contrary, Verizon did not take TARP money. The Federal Reserve Bank bought $1.5 billion of Verizon's short term (90 days)[8] commercial paper. The funds for the purchase of the short term IOUs, from several corporations, did not come from the TARP program.[9]
Personal life[edit]
Seidenberg and his wife, Phyllis, have two adult children and reside in the New York City suburbs.[4]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
