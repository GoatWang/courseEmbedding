Description:

TECHNICAL FIELDThe present invention relates to a statement presenter mechanism which is particularly useful in an automated teller machine (ATM). Specifically, the apparatus of the present invention is directed to a simple, yet reliable, mechanism for presenting any one of a number of different sized bank statements, receipts or other documents which are presented individually or in stacks. In the event a customer fails to take the statements after they have been presented, the apparatus may retract the statements back into the automated teller machine and deposit it in a storage bin or other container. BACKGROUND ARTAutomated teller machines are known in the prior art. Banking customers may access their accounts using a magnetically encoded card. Generally the customer will insert their card into the machine, which will correlate the identifying information encoded on the card with a personal identification number provided by the customer. This verifies the customer's identity to the computer system which operates the machine. Thereafter the customer may typically use the ATM to conduct banking transactions as well as to check the status of various accounts that they have with the financial institution. When all of the transactions and inquiries are completed, the customer will receive his card back from the machine along with one or more receipts documenting the transactions performed. As more people conduct their banking transactions electronically using ATMs, there is a desire to provide the customer with more information. Customers often want information about their accounts, including what checks have cleared and/or what other deductions and/or charges may have been applied. Customers may also wish to obtain information about other services provided by the bank such as investments, retirement accounts or the terms available for various types of loans. It is usually not possible to print much information on a receipt that is provided by an ATM. This is because such receipts are typically fairly small in size. To provide all the information that customers want in a legible format, larger sheets are needed. In addition, information about some accounts, such as checking accounts, may be so extensive that even if large sheets are provided, multiple sheets will be required. The customer may wish to receive their entire checking account statement for the month or perhaps several months from the automated teller machine. Most ATMs that are presently in use are not capable of printing or delivering the type of sheets that are necessary for providing detailed customer statements nor are existing ATMs capable of delivering stacks of multiple statement sheets. Further adding to the difficulty associated with providing detailed statement information from ATMs is that different institutions often desire to print different types of statements. These statements have different physical dimensions. As a result, any mechanism that is made for stacking and delivering statements to a customer from an ATM would have to be made to suit the particular size of statement that the bank wanted to deliver. This increases complexity and cost. Another problem with statements presented by ATMs is that a customer who has conducted a banking transaction will often forget to take their receipt, or perhaps does not want the receipt. If so, the receipt will generally remain protruding from the face of the machine and sometimes the next person to use the machine will pull out the old receipt and throw it away. Passersby or other users will also look at the receipt out of curiosity. If the receipt contains confidential information regarding accounts, such as checking accounts, this could present undesirable security risks. Regardless of whether the document contains confidential information, an untaken receipt becomes a nuisance and a potential source of litter. This is undesirable as it will tend to clutter the area of the automated teller machine making it unattractive and undesirable for customers. United States Patent No. 5253861 discloses a document registration apparatus that includes a plurality of laterally spaced registration stops which pivot about a horizontal axis for stopping motion of documents and registering the leading edge of documents to a particular direction in the apparatus. The apparatus also includes at least one pinch roller cooperatively operating with conveying structure for moving the registered documents away from the apparatus for further processing. Japanese Patent Application No. 3-21140 discloses apparatus into which a single sheet may be inserted. A shutter is provided to prevent a sheet from being skewed and jamming, and sensors are installed to determine whether an inserted sheet is straight. When a sheet which a user is trying to insert is not properly aligned the apparatus may output a voice announcement instructing the user to straighten or move the sheet. Thus, there exists a need for an apparatus and method that enables a customer to receive a plurality of statements detailing the status of different accounts and transactions from an ATM and which avoids disclosure of the information and minimizes litter in the event the customer fails to take their statements. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, there is provided paper presentation apparatus for an automated teller machine, the apparatus comprising: a movable first belt; a first axle and a second axle disposed from said first axle, said first belt being supported by said first and second axles; a movable second belt extending generally parallel of said first belt; a paper stop; and a mechanism interconnecting said paper stop and said first belt, said mechanism including a first arm member and a second arm member, said first arm member being rotatable about a first pivot and said second arm member being rotatable about a second pivot and wherein said first axle is journalled in said first arm member on a first side of said first pivot and said paper stop is connected to said first arm member on an opposed side of said first pivot, and wherein said second axle is journalled in said second arm member on a first side of said second pivot and said paper stop is connected to said second arm member on an opposed side of said second pivot, the arrangement being such that as said paper stop is moved away from said second belt, said first belt is moved toward said second belt, and vice versa. A further aspect of the invention provides a method for presenting stacks of sheets to a customer from an apparatus in an automated banking machine, the method comprising the steps of: moving sheets in a first direction into a stack on a first belt against a paper stop; disposing said paper stop from said stack; moving a second belt to engage said stack on an opposed side from said first belt; and moving said first and second belts in said first direction to move said stack to an exit end of said apparatus for delivery of said stack to a customer. Advantages of embodiments of the invention are that they can:(a) provide an apparatus that stacks documents and delivers the stack to a customer using an ATM:(b) provide an apparatus that can easily be modified to handle documents of different size;(c) provide an apparatus for retracting a stack of documents and storing them in the event that a customer fails to take the documents within a predetermined time;(d) provide an apparatus that can be operated to deliver documents to a customer either in stacks or one at a time.(e) provide an apparatus that verifies that the documents entering the apparatus have been cut to the proper length;(f) provide an apparatus for delivering statements to a customer using an ATM that is both reliable and low in cost;(g) provide an ATM that presents stacks of various sized documents to a customer;(h) provide a method for stacking and presenting documents to a customer using an ATM. A preferred embodiment of the invention provides a statement presenter apparatus incorporated into an ATM. The apparatus receives statements that have been printed on paper that has been taken from a storage bin within the machine and passed to a printer for printing information related to a customer's transactions or accounts. The statement paper presenter receives the documents and stacks them. The stack may then be presented to the customer by the apparatus. If the documents are not taken by the customer within a predetermined time, they can be returned through the apparatus and held within the machine. A preferred embodiment of the invention can place the papers to be delivered to the customer on to a lower conveyor belt which can move the papers and stacks them. The papers can be stacked substantially flush against the paper stop. Once the printing of statements has been completed and all of the documents collected against the stop, the paper stop will preferably move upward while an upper belt moves downward. The paper can then be moved by frictional engagement between the upper and lower belts by cooperative movement of the belts. In a preferred embodiment, a sensor enables the belt to push a portion of the stack of papers through an exit slot in the fascia of the automated teller machine. After a predetermined time, if the papers have not been removed by the customer from the machine, the belts can operate in the reverse direction and move the papers back into the machine. This rearward movement of the papers eventually causes them to engage a diverter plate and be routed into a storage bin. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying figures, in which:Figure 1 is a perspective view of a preferred embodiment of the present invention.Figure 2 is a sectioned partial side view of a portion of the preferred embodiment shown in Figure 1 wherein the paper stop is in the downward position and the upper belt is in an upward position.Figure 3 is a sectioned partial side view of a portion of a statement presenter apparatus wherein the paper stop is in an upward position and the upper belt is in a downward position.Figure 4 is a transparent side view of the embodiment of Figure 1 and further illustrates the mechanism for moving the paper stop upwardly while moving the upper belt downwardly and vice versa.Figure 5 is a partial sectional side view which corresponds to Figure 2 showing the paper stop in the downward position with the upward position thereof shown in phantom.Figure 6 is a partial sectional side view corresponding to Figure 3 and showing the paper stop in the upward position and the upper belt moved downward to deliver statements to a customer.Figure 7 is a view corresponding to Figure 6 and showing statements that have been retracted by the apparatus.Figure 8 is a right side view of the apparatus shown with the mechanism moved to a position with the paper stop in an upward position.Figure 9 is a right side view of the apparatus with the mechanism positioned so that the paper stop is in a downward position.Figure 10 is a left side view of the apparatus showing the position of the mechanism with the paper stop in the upward position, and the alternative position shown in phantom.Figure 11 is a left side view of the apparatus with the mechanism shown with the paper stop in a downward position.Figure 12 is a left side view of the mechanism showing the gear train for driving the upper belts of the apparatus. Referring now to the drawings and particularly to Figure 1, there is shown therein a preferred embodiment of the invention generally indicated 10. The preferred embodiment of the invention receives paper that has been pulled from a storage bin within an automated teller machine by rollers or a comparable mechanism associated with a printer. The printer prints information desired by a customer on the paper. The paper is either pre-cut or is preferably cut to size by a mechanism associated with the printer. After the paper exits the printer, it is received by the statement presenter which either delivers the papers to the customer, or if a customer fails to take the statements, retracts them into the machine where they are stored until removed by a technician. A preferred embodiment of statement presenter is shown in Figure 1. For simplicity, the main paper path is further illustrated by the partially sectioned side views in Figures 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7. As shown in Figures 2 and 5, a statement paper 12 which has exited a printer mechanism and has been cut to length, is pulled by a set of rollers 20 which ride on lower belts 22. The rollers pull the paper into the apparatus. As the paper begins to exit the rollers, a flapper mechanism 24 provides rotational contact against the paper using flexible arms 26. The flexible arms 26 urge the paper to continue its movement away from the rollers and to continue into contact with the moving lower belt which moves in the direction of arrow A as shown in Figure 2. As later explained, upper belts 30 move in coordination with the lower belts and further help to guide the paper into position. The paper moves on the lower belts until the leading edge of the paper abuttingly contacts a paper stop 28. The paper stop 28 has fingers 29 that extend transversely downward between the lower belts. Generally, the lower belts will continue moving for a few moments after the paper has engaged the fingers of the stop thereby assuring that the paper has reached the stop. Once this has occurred, the belts will stop until the next paper, if any, arrives from the printer. A motor 27 (see Figures 9 and 10) drives the belts of the present invention in a manner later discussed in detail. A sensor 37 monitors the paper entering the apparatus. The sensor 37 which is, preferably a photo eye or similar device, is used to assure that the paper has been properly cut. The sensor also controls the movement of the lower belts. Thus, when the sensor senses paper coming into the paper presenter, the lower belts are driven to carry the paper forward to the paper stop. Likewise, once the sensor determines that the trailing end of the paper has passed the sensor, the lower belts run for an additional time deemed necessary to carry the paper to the paper stop and then the lower belts are turned off. This is done under the control of a processor, schematically indicated 17, which is appropriately programmed to drive the lower belts in accordance with the signals received from the sensor. If the sensor does not detect the trailing edge of the paper within a time calculated by the processor, it is known that the paper has not been cut, or there is another problem. The processor then generates a signal indicating a fault condition and further operation of the mechanism is avoided. In an alternative embodiment, an automated mechanism can be connected to the sensor 37 wherein the sensor enables the processor to calculate the length of the paper entering the paper presenter and the mechanism adjusts the paper stop to accommodate the particular paper size. However, because in most embodiments only a single size of paper will be presented at one time, a manually adjustable paper stop is used in the preferred embodiment. Paper stop 28 is preferably comprised of relatively hard and resilient material. It is adjustable and can be slid along guide supports 34 and 34' to accommodate different lengths of paper. The resilient character of the paper stop provides for holding the stop on the supports once it has been placed in the desired position. Preferably the paper stop is positioned so that the end of the paper is able to exit rollers 20 and be held in place by the action of the arms of the flapper mechanism 24. If the paper stop is set too far forward, the papers will not be in proper position for the flapper mechanism to work properly and may not allow the paper to pass from the rollers 20, resulting in paper jams. Additional papers that come from the printer pass on top of the stack of papers supported on the lower belts of the mechanism in similar fashion. The flapper mechanism reduces paper jamming and will generally cause the papers to become neatly stacked one on top of the other. A platen 35 which extends on the sides of the lower belts further helps to support the stack. Once all of the desired papers have been printed and stacked upon the lower belts with their edges against the paper stop, a signal is sent by the processor. This signal controls a drive mechanism which causes the paper stop to move upwardly away from the paper. The paper stop is moved on a paper stop frame assembly 40 upon which are mounted the guide supports 34 and 34'. As illustrated in Figures 3 and 6, as the paper stop moves upwardly away from the stack, an upper belt assembly simultaneously moves down and engages the top of the paper (or the top paper in the stack of papers). The top and bottom belts are then started and move at the same speed in substantial cooperation to move the stack outward to an exit slot 32. Figures 4 and 8 through 11 further illustrate the mechanism which raises the paper stop 28 while lowering the upper belts 30 (and vice versa). As best shown in Figures 4, 8 and 9, a rigid dog-leg shaped arm 42 has a slotted rear portion 44 in which is journalled a back axle 50 of the upper drive belts. A middle pivot point of arm 42 is movable about a fixed shaft 49. The fixed shaft 49 extends across the entire housing and is preferably secured at each end to the housing 8 as shown in Figure 1. Arm 42 further includes a slotted front portion 48 which accepts a connector pin 62. Pin 62 extends from a front arm 52, and connects arm 42 thereto. The back arm 42 and front arm 52 are interconnected to the paper stop 28 via connector pins 53 and 55 which are attached to the paper stop frame assembly 40. The connector pins 53 and 55 are enabled to move vertically in slots 57 which extend through the walls of the housing. Similarly, the front arm 52 has a forward portion 54 in which a front axle 56 of the upper belts 30 is journalled. Front arm 52 pivots about a fixed shaft 58 which is preferably fixed to housing 8 and extends across the entire housing in a manner similar to shaft 49 (see Figures 1, 8 and 9). The forward portion of back arm 42 overlaps with the rearward portion of the front arm 52. This overlapping section of contains the pin 62 which provides a pivoting connection. Arm 42 is preferably slotted so as to enable the movement of pin 62 therein. Hence, as pin 62 moves upwardly, the paper stop 28 moves upwardly due to the resulting upward movement of pins 53 and 55. Simultaneously, the front and rear axles 56 and 50 of the upper belts move downward due to the rotation of the arms about shafts 49 and 58. The axles 56 and 50 of the upper belts are enabled to move in the housing 8 in vertical slots 70 as shown in Figures 1, 8 and 9. The frame assembly 40 also has slots 41 in the walls thereof. As shown in Figures 2 and 3, the shafts 58 and 49 which extend across the housing extend through slots 41 and enable the frame assembly to move thereon in guided relation. The upward and downward movement of the paper stop and upper belt assembly is controlled by a rack and pinion gear train which is best shown in Figures 1, 10 and 11. A gear member 64 is positioned on the left side of the housing. The gear member is preferably integrally formed with a front arm having a forward portion similar in shape to arm 52 previously discussed. The gear teeth on the gear member 64 engage a pinion 66. As the pinion rotates clockwise as shown in Figures 10 and 11, the gear member rotates counter clockwise, raising the paper stop and lowering the upper belt. Conversely, as the pinion moves counterclockwise, the gear member moves clockwise, lowering the paper stop and raising the upper belt. Hence, the paper stop and the upper belt are interconnected in a way that causes each to move in the opposite direction. This is controlled by the direction and amount of rotation of the pinion. The pinion 66 is driven by a drive motor 67 which is positioned opposite motor 27 on the frame. Further, as shown in Figures 10 and 11, a rear arm 68 which is a mirror image of arm 42 is positioned on the left side of the housing and engages a pin 65 on the gear member in a slotted fashion similar to arm 42. The drive mechanism for the belts is best shown with reference to Figures 9, 10 and 12. As shown in Figure 9, motor 27 drives a belt 72 which in turn drives a pulley 74. The shaft of motor 27 also has a hand wheel 73 attached thereto which facilitates manual rotation of the motor. This is useful in clearing paper jams. Pulley 74 is connected to a shaft 76 which drives the lower belts. Shaft 76 extends through the housing to the left hand side as shown in Figures 10 and 12. Shaft 76 drives a gear 78 on the left hand side of the housing. Gear 78 is connected to a gear 80, which in turn drives a shaft 82. Rollers 20 are mounted on shaft 82 and are driven thereby. Gear 80 drives another gear 84. Gear 84 is a floating gear which is mounted on a link 86 which is rotatably movable about shaft 82. Gear 84, in turn, drives another gear 88 which is mounted on a link 90. Link 90 is rotatable about the axis of gear 84. Gear 88 drives front axle 56 of the upper belt. As a result, axle 56 is enabled to move up and down in slot 70 while being continuously driven by motor 27. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, axles 56 and 50 may include appropriate bushings thereon so as to enable them to move up and down in slots 70 without sustaining significant frictional losses. In operation, once the printed papers are collected against the paper stop 28, motor 67 operates to rotate gear member 64 counterclockwise. This raises the paper stop and lowers the upper belts. Motor 27 is then started so that the upper and lower belts cooperatively move the stack forward, thereby moving the stack of papers toward the exit slot 32. An exit sensor 38, which is preferably a photo eye or similar device, senses when the front edge of the papers have passed through the exit slot. As the ATM is designed so that the papers in this position are extending through an opening in the machine and are accessible by the customer, the processor 17 which operates the machine causes motor 27 to turn off. Thereafter, motor 67 turns on so as to raise the upper belts. The customer is then free to remove the stack from the machine. In the event that exit sensor 38 does not sense the removal of the stack within a pre-set time, the processor controlling the operation of the machine will cause motor 67 to operate, again lowering the upper belts. Motor 27 is then operated in the reverse direction so that the stack is drawn back between the belts and moved towards rollers 20 in the direction indicated by Figure 7. As the stack approaches rollers 20, the stack engages a flexible diverter plate 36. Rollers 20 extend through cut-outs in diverter plate 36 to engage belts 22. Diverter plate 36 guides the paper below the plate and into a storage bin 39 where the papers will be held until removed by a technician. Hence, when paper enters the presenter, the paper moves over the diverter plate and on to the lower belt. However, when the paper is moved in the opposite direction towards rollers 20, it engages the flexible diverter plate and passes below it so that it can be diverted into the bin. Of course, in alternative embodiments of the invention, the paper may instead of being held, may be carried out of the bin by sets of rollers or by other mechanical means to a location where it may be periodically removed by a service technician. This ensures that the customer's confidential account information is not available to unauthorized persons who might otherwise find it as litter near the ATM. It should further be pointed out that while the presenter mechanism is preferably operated so as to stack papers and then present the stack to the customer, it may alternatively be operated to present statements to a customer one at a time in the manner traditionally done by ATM machines. In this mode of operation, the statement presenter is operated with the upper belts engaged with the lower belts. As a result, when a paper passes into the device from the printer, it is immediately carried between the belts to the exit end to be taken by the customer. Depending on the nature and speed at which the statements are received from the printer, it may be alternatively possible to selectively position the paper stop so that the papers are enabled to ride below the paper stop on the lower belt flights 22 without direct engagement with the upper belt flights 30. In this manner the papers are simply carried unobstructed in a one-at-a-time manner to the customer. This may be advantageous when the operation of the ATM involves the delivery of only a single document and where it is undesirable to take the time associated with raising and lowering the upper belt flights. The statement presenter mechanism may be readily adjusted to accommodate various paper sizes. The paper length may be changed by simply moving the paper stop 28 along the guide supports 34 and 34' to the desired position. Further, the mechanism is made so that the width of the paper may be varied substantially without modification of the mechanism. This results because of the wide clearance area through the device and the central location of the belts of the preferred embodiment. Any paper width which can be engaged by one or both of the belts and which can be abuttingly engaged with the paper stop may be delivered by the mechanism. The preferred embodiment of the present invention enables the collection of a substantial number of statements in a stack which then can be transported in a compressed manner through an outlet slot in the facia of an ATM machine and delivered to a customer. The statement presenter is reliable and avoids paper jams. It also avoids litter in the event that the customer fails to take their statements. Although the preferred form of apparatus is used in presenting documents that have been printed within an automated teller machine, it may be alternatively used to accumulate documents such as currency notes, coupons, tickets, vouchers or other pre-printed documents and then to deliver them in a stack to a customer operating a dispensing device. Although the embodiment shown has two upper belts and two lower belts, alternative embodiments may include addiitional belts journalled on the axles. Applicants have found that in some embodiments it is desirable to have a third upper belt positioned in centered relation between the other upper belts for moving the stack. The third belt may be positioned above a platen that extends between the lower belts. When the upper belts are lowered, the stack rides on the lower belt and the platen to either the exit slot or the diverter plate. Other embodiments may have other numbers and configurations of platens, belts or other driving means. In the foregoing description certain terms have been used for brevity, clarity and understanding, however no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom because such terms are for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. Moreover, the descriptions and illustrations given are by way of examples and the invention is not limited to the details shown and described. Having described the features, discoveries and principles of the invention, the manner in which it is constructed and operated, and the advantages and useful results that may be attained, the new and useful structures, devices, elements, arrangements, parts, combinations, systems, equipment, operations and relationships are set forth in the appended claims.

Description:

TECHNICAL FIELDThis invention relates to devices for identifying the type and validity of documents. Specifically this invention relates to a device for identifying the denomination and authenticity of currency notes. BACKGROUND ARTNumerous devices have been previously developed for identifying documents and determining their authenticity. Document US 3922557, US 5 367 577 and WO 93/23824 describe examples of such devices. Likewise, devices have been previously developed for determining the denomination and authenticity of bank and currency notes. Such devices commonly test different properties of a presented note and based on the properties sensed, give an indication of the denomination and/or authenticity of the presented note. All such prior art devices have limitations. Many prior art devices require precise alignment of the note during sensing of its properties. This requires the device to include a mechanism to align the notes and often limits the speed at which the notes can be processed. In addition, some devices require that presented notes be oriented in a particular way as they are sensed. This limits their usefulness as notes are often not presented in a uniform orientation. Many prior art devices for determining note denomination and validity are capable of processing only a small number of note types. This presents drawbacks as other note types cannot be processed. Such prior art devices are also generally made to be used with only one type of currency such as the currency of a particular country. Often it is difficult or impossible to adapt such devices to handle currencies of countries which have different physical properties. Furthermore, it may be difficult to adapt such devices to a new printing series of notes within the same country. Many prior art devices are also amenable to compromise by counterfeit notes. It is becoming easier to produce highly accurate counterfeit reproductions of currency. By mimicking the properties of a note that are tested by prior art currency denominators and validaters, it is often possible to have counterfeit notes accepted. To minimize the risk of acceptance of counterfeits, the range of the acceptance criteria in prior art devices can often be set more closely. However, currency notes in circulation change properties through use fairly quickly. Notes in circulation may change their properties through handling and wear. Notes may become dirty or marked with ink or other substances. Notes may also lose their color due to having been mistakenly washed with clothing or exposed to water or sunlight. Prior art currency denominators and validaters may reject valid notes which exhibit such properties when the criteria for acceptance is set too tightly. Note denominators and validaters currently available may also be difficult to program and calibrate. Such devices, particularly if they must have the capability of handling more than one type of note, may require significant effort to set up and program. In addition, such devices may require initial calibration and frequent periodic recalibration and adjustment to maintain a suitable level of accuracy. Prior art note denominators and validaters, particularly those having greater capabilities, often occupy significant physical space. This limits where they may be installed. In addition, such devices also often have a relatively high cost which limits their suitability for particular uses and applications. Thus, there exists a need for a currency note denominator and validater which is more accurate, has greater capabilities, is faster, smaller in size, and lower in cost.

According to an embodiment of the invention, there can be provided an apparatus and method for providing an indication of the type of a note. The apparatus can be used for providing signals indicative of a denomination of a currency note. This apparatus may also provide an indication of note orientation and/or note authenticity. An embodiment of the invention can be used in connection with a transport for moving notes. A plurality of spaced spot sensing assemblies can be disposed transversely to a direction of note movement in the transport. Three spot sensing assemblies can be used, although other embodiments of the invention may include other numbers of such assemblies. Each assembly can include a radiation source which comprises a plurality of emitters. Each emitter can generate radiation at a different wavelength. According to an embodiment of the invention four emitters are used. The emitters can generally span the range of visible light as well as infrared. According to an embodiment of the invention the emitters include in each assembly red, green, blue and infrared emitters. Each of the emitters in an assembly can be aimed to illuminate a spot on a passing note. Each spot sensing assembly includes a first detector. The first detector can be positioned on a first side of the note as it passes in the transport. The first detector can be positioned in centered relation with respect to the emitters. The first detector can sense radiation from the emitters reflected from the test spots on the note. Each assembly also includes a second detector. The second detector is positioned on a second side of the note opposite the first detector. The second detector can detect radiation from each emitter that passes through the test spots on the note. The apparatus inlcudes a circuit in operative connection with a data store. The circuit can be operable to actuate each of the emitters in each spot sensing assembly in a sequence. In accordance with one form of the invention the sequence all of the emitters of the same type produce radiation simultaneously while all of the other types of emitters are off. Alternatively, the sequence may provide for emitters in the spot sensing assemblies to be turned on at different times. However, in one embodiment, only one emitter in each spot sensing assembly is , active at any one time while the sensors are being read. The emitters can be activated in the sequence continuously. The emitters can be sequenced numerous times as the note in the transport passes adjacent to the spot sensing assemblies. As a result, three sets of test spots can be arranged in a line are sensed on each passing note. For each test spot, the first detector which senses reflection can produce a first signal responsive to each emitter. Each first signal can be representative of the amount of radiation reflected from the test spot from a corresponding emitter. Likewise, the second detector can produce second signals responsive to the amount of light transmitted through the test spot on the note from each emitter. The circuit can be operative to receive the first and second signals from the first and second detectors respectively, and to generate reflectance and transmission values in response thereto. For each test spot four reflectance and four transmission values can be generated. Likewise, for each row of three test spots which are checked on the note simultaneously by the three spot sensing assemblies, twelve reflectance values and twelve, transmission values can be generated. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention generally about 29 rows of test spots can be sensed as the note moves past the spot sensing assemblies. This can result in the circuit generating about 348 reflective values and 348 transmission values per note. The values in the data store can correspond to reflectance and transmission values for a number of note types in various orientations and spatial positions. The circuit can be operative to generate stored value sets from the values in the data store. Stored value sets can be generated based on the angle of skew of the note, which is detected as, it passes the sensing assemblies. Numerous stored value sets can be generated by the circuit, each corresponding to a particular note, denomination, note orientation, and note position. The circuit can be operative to calculate values representative of the levels of correlation between the sensed value set of reflectance and transmission values for the note, and each of the stored value sets. By comparing the level of correlation between the sensed value set and the stored value sets, a highest correlation value can be determined. The highest level of correlation will be with a stored value set that corresponds to the particular denomination and orientation of the note which passed through the transport to produce the sensed value set. The circuit can be operative to generate a signal indicative of the note type it identifies. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention the circuit can be operative to compare the highest correlation value with a set threshold value. Even worn notes and those that have been subject to abuse exhibit a relatively high level of correlation with a stored value set for the correct note type. If however, the level of correlation is not above the set threshold, then the note may not be identifiable, or it may he a counterfeit or it may be identified and determined to be unfit for reuse. The circuit can generate signals indicative of these conditions. BRIER DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT INVENTIONReferring now to the drawings and particularly to Figure 1, there is shown therein a preferred embodiment of an apparatus of the present invention generally indicated 10. The apparatus includes a note transport 12. Transport 12 is preferably a belt-type transport that moves sheets such as currency notes one at a time from an entry end 14 to an exit end 16. Sheets such as notes move on the transport 12 in a note direction indicated by Arrow A. The apparatus of the present invention also includes a plurality of spot sensing assemblies 18. The preferred form of the invention includes three spot sensing assemblies which are spaced from one another in a direction transverse of the note direction of note movement (see Figure 3). Each of the spot sensing assemblies includes a reflectance detector, schematically indicated 20. Each spot sensing assembly 18 also includes a transmission detector schematically indicated 22. As indicated in Figure 1 the reflectance detector 20 is in operative connection with, and outputs first signals to, a control circuit schematically indicated 24. The transmission detectors 22 are also in operative connection with the control circuit 24, and the transmission detectors output second signals thereto. Control circuit 24 is also in operative connection with a data store schematically indicated 26 which holds stored values in a manner later explained. The apparatus of the present invention may in certain embodiments also include auxiliary validation sensors schematically indicated 28. The auxiliary sensors 28 preferably detect properties of passing notes that are not detected by the spot sensing assemblies. These auxiliary sensors may include, for example, magnetic type sensors or sensors for sensing identification strips on passing notes or sheets. The auxiliary sensors 28 do not form part of the present invention and are not further discussed herein. It will be understood however, that many types of auxiliary sensors may be used in connection with the present invention and the signals output by such sensors are processed and analyzed in the control circuit 24 through appropriate electronic components. The spot sensing assemblies 18 are shown in greater detail in Figures 2 and 3. Each spot sensing assembly includes a reflectance detector 20, which in the preferred form of the invention includes a photocell. The reflectance detectors 20 are positioned on a first side of a passing note 30 which is shown in phantom in Figure 2. The transport 12 moves note 30 past the spot sensing assemblies. Each spot sensing assembly 18 includes four emitters 32. The emitters 32 are positioned generally adjacent to, and in surrounding relation of, each reflectance detector 20. Each spot sensing assembly includes emitters with wavelengths which generally span the visible range of light and infrared. In the described embodiment each spot sensing assembly includes a blue emitter, a green emitter, a red emitter, and an infrared emitter. In the preferred form of the invention, the emitters are light emitting diodes (LEDs) which are selectively operable to produce generally monochromatic light at a particular wavelength. In other embodiments of the invention other types and wavelengths of emitters may be used. Each emitter 32 in a spot sensing assembly is oriented so as to direct and focus radiation onto a test spot schematically indicated 34, which is shown on the adjacent surface of a passing note. In the preferred form of the invention, because there are three spot sensing assemblies, properties of the note are sampled simultaneously at three test spots 34 which are transversely spaced across the bill. As best shown in Figure 3, radiation from the emitters 32 is reflected from each test spot 34 to the reflectance sensor 20 of the spot sensing assembly. The reflected light is passed through a lens 36 adjacent to each reflectance detector to further focus the reflected light thereon. Radiation from the emitters 32 also passes through each test spot on the test note. The transmitted radiation passes to the transmission detector 22 of each of the spot sensing assemblies 18. In the preferred form of the invention each of the transmission detectors 22 includes a photocell. As a result, when reflectance detector 20 senses radiation from one of the emitters reflected from the test note, transmission detector 22 simultaneously senses radiation transmitted through the test note from the same emitter. In the preferred form of the invention the control circuit 24 is operable to selectively actuate each of the emitters 32. The control circuit actuates each type emitter in each spot sensing assembly individually, so that only one emitter in a spot sensing assembly is producing radiation at any time. In one embodiment, the control circuit 24 is operative to activate the same type emitter in each of the spot sensing assemblies 18 simultaneously. For example, all the blue emitters in each of the spot sensing assemblies are activated to produce radiation at the same time. Thereafter, all the blue emitters go off and all the green emitters in each of the spot sensing assemblies come on. Thereafter, the green emitters go off and the red emitters come on. When the red emitters go off the infrared emitters come on. The infrared emitters go off and the sequence repeats. Alternatively, the emitters may be activated in a "marquee" style so that the particular type emitter in each assembly is on for a time before it is read, and emitters of the same type are read at different times. This approach has the advantage that it enables the emitters to stabilize before being read by the controller. Of course, the sequence of emitters may be different in other embodiments. The emitters radiate individually and in sequence rapidly such that each emitter comes on one time for each test spot 34. The test spots preferably are discrete and each of the emitters direct light onto generally the same spot on the note during one sequence despite the fact that the note is moving. As those skilled in the art will appreciate from the foregoing description, each reflectance detector 20 produces four first signals for each test spot 34. The four first signals are produced responsive to radiation from the blue, green, red, and infrared emitters respectively. Similarly, each transmission detector 22 produces four second signals for each test spot 34. There is one second signal for the radiation transmitted through the test spot from each of the four emitters in the spot sensing assembly. The control circuit 24 receives each of these first signals and is operative to generate a reflectance value responsive to each signal representative of the magnitude of light reflected by the note 30 from each of the emitters. Likewise, the control circuit 24 is operative to generate transmission values responsive to each of the four second signals from transmission detector 22. Each of the transmission values are representative of transmitted light through the test spot from each emitter. Because there are three spot sensing assemblies 18 spaced transversely across the note, the first circuit is operative to generate 12 reflectance values and 12 transmission values for each row of 3 test spots 34 on the note. In the preferred form of the invention, the control circuit 24 is operative to actuate the emitters in the spot sensing assemblies very rapidly. This is done so the test spots-are maintained discrete and compact. A number of test spots are preferably sensed as a note moves past the three spot sensing assemblies 18 in the transport. In the preferred form of the invention, the spot sensing assemblies are actuated so that each spot sensing assembly senses about 29 test spots on a standard U.S. currency note. This means that generally (29 x 3 = 87) test spots are sensed on the average note. Because 4 transmission and 4 reflectance values are generated per test spot (87 x 8 = 696), about 696 data values per note are gathered. The transport 12 is preferably moved in such a speed that 15 standard U.S. currency notes per second are moved past the spot sensing assemblies. Of course, in other embodiments different numbers of test spots, data values and note speeds may be used. A fundamental advantage of the present invention is that the emitters produce radiation which spans the visible range of light as well as infrared. This provides signals which test the validity of the note at a number of different wavelengths in both the transmission and reflectance modes. This enables the gathering of much more data concerning the note image and material properties than prior types of note denominators and validaters. A further fundamental advantage of the present invention is that it is capable of identifying many types of notes in different orientations. As later explained, the preferred form of the present invention does not require that the notes be precisely aligned either in the note direction, or transversely in the note path. As schematically represented in Figure 4, a note which is delivered to the present invention for identification and validation may be one of many types. The preferred form of the invention is configured to identify 20 different denominations of notes. Of course, other embodiments of the invention may analyze different numbers of note denominations. However, in the preferred form of the present invention, there is no requirement that the notes delivered be oriented a particular way. Therefore, notes may be delivered face up, face down, as well as with the top of the note leading, or with the bottom of the note leading. To identify the note as a particular type, the present invention must be able to handle notes delivered in all four orientations. In Figure 4, a sensed value set 38, representative of a set of data sensed from the test note is shown. As previously discussed, in the preferred embodiment, this sensed value set will generally include a set that is 24 by 29. This is because each row of three test spots generates 24 values (12 reflectance and 12 transmission) and there are generally 29 rows of test spots on the note. The right side of Figure 4 shows stored value sets 40. In the preferred form of the invention, the stored value sets are produced by the control circuit 24. The sensed value set 38 generated from the note is compared for correlation with each of the stored value sets 40. In Figure 4, 80 stored value sets are shown. This is representative of the 20 note denominations multiplied by four possible orientations for each note type. As will be later explained in detail, in the preferred form of the invention, there are many more than 80 stored value sets to which the sensed value set is compared. This is because the apparatus must determine not only the particular note type ( from among 80 possible note types and orientations), but must also determine the note type even though the note position may be shifted either in the direction in which the note is transported or transverse to the note direction, or may be skewed relative to the direction of transport. The process by which the control circuit calculates the values representation of the level of correlation between the sensed valued set (which is representative of the reflectance and transmission values from the sensed note) and the stored value sets, is schematically represented in Figure 5. For purposes of the correlation calculation carried out by the control circuit 24, the sensed value set 38 is considered to be (x) data. The data values in the stored value set indicated 42 are considered to be (y) data. The level of correlation is calculated in accordance with the equation: Cx,y=∑xi-μx⁢yi-μyσx⁢σy where:
Cx,yis the correlation coefficient.xiis the sensed value from the sensed value set data.yiis the corresponding value in the stored value set.µxis the average of the values in the portion of the sensed value set being correlated.µyis the average of the values in the corresponding portion of the stored value set being correlated.σxis the standard deviation of the sensed values in the portion of the sensed value set being correlated.σyis the standard deviation in the corresponding portion of the stored value set. As will be appreciated, the greater the correlation coefficient the higher the level of correlation between the sensed value set and the stored value set being compared. A high value is indicative that the stored value set corresponds to the particular type test note that generates the data in the sensed value set. Turning now to Figure 6 there is schematically shown a sensed value set 44 from a note that is moved past spot sensing assemblies 18. As shown in the upper portion of Figure 6, sensed value set 44 is a matrix that is 24 by 29. The lower portion of Figure 6 shows a similarly sized stored value set 46 which is generated by circuit 24 from data in the data store 26 in a manner later explained. In the preferred form of the invention each set comprising the three columns of "x" values representing one color and mode in sensed value set 44 is checked for correlation with corresponding values in the three columns of stored value set 46. A correlation coefficient is calculated for the values in each triple column set. The correlation coefficients for each of the 8 triple column sets are then multiplied together by the control circuit to obtain an overall correlation value indicative of a level of correlation between the sensed value set and the stored value set. In one form of the invention the correlation coefficient values for reflectance mode values are first multiplied together to obtain an overall correlation value for reflectance. Thereafter the same is done for all correlation coefficient values for transmission mode values to obtain an overall value for transmission. These overall values are then multiplied together to calculate a final value indicative of correlation of the stored value set and the test note. Calculating the transmission and reflectance values separately has the advantage that the individual values can be analyzed individually by the control circuit in accordance with its programming. This may be preferred in some embodiments. For example, high correlation for overall reflectance but not transmission may be indicative of some quality of the note that may warrant taking it out of circulation. Other embodiments may combine correlation values in other ways, such as by wavelength or radiation. The combination of correlation values for analysis may differ in other embodiments depending on the notes and properties of interest. The present invention, because the stored value sets generated are arranged in matrices, can analyze certain physical areas on notes in detail through programming of the control circuit. Thus in embodiments of the invention the manner in which sensed and stored value sets are generated and correlation values calculated may be tailored to note properties and areas of interest. The particular type of note passing through the apparatus of the invention, is generally indicated by the stored value set having the highest overall level of correlation with the sensed value set. This stored value set corresponds to one note type, for example, a particular note denomination in a particular orientation. Once the control circuit determines the stored value set with the highest level of correlation, it then indicates the particular type of note that it has determined the passing note to be by generating a signal indicative thereof. In some embodiments it is also desirable to point out situations where the passing note has a relatively low level of correlation with all of the possible note types. This may be indicative of a counterfeit note, a foreign note or currency that is unacceptable for reuse due to tears, dirt, wear, or extraneous markings. The control circuit 24 is operable to provide an indication not only of the identity of the note type which best correlates with the sensed value set, but also to indicate when the calculated highest level of correlation is below a set threshold which suggests a counterfeit or unacceptable note. Alternatively, the control circuit of the apparatus of the present invention may be configured to include several set thresholds for correlation. These may correspond to notes which are suspect as counterfeit or severely damaged, and notes which merely exhibit signs of wear, age or abuse which make them unacceptable for return to circulation. Because the preferred form of the present invention provides data which accurately identifies notes by denomination despite wear, dirt and extraneous markings, it is possible to make such judgments concerning the quality of a note as well as to identify its type. The present invention also provides data which may be used advantageously specifically for counterfeit detection purposes. The ability of the invention to test both transmission and reflectance across a broad spectrum of radiation, and to compare sensed data to stored values for proper notes, enables the setting of thresholds for particular wavelengths of radiation. Some wavelengths of radiation may provide data more indicative than others of counterfeit or unacceptable notes. This is particularly true in countries which have currency notes that include different color schemes for different denominations. The control circuit of the present invention may be programmed to abstract and analyze particular abstracted correlation data for this purpose. While in the embodiment of the invention previously described, correlation coefficients are calculated for sets which correspond to 3 columns of data and these correlation coefficients are then combined, other embodiments may use sets comprised of other portions of the sensed data for purposes of calculating the correlation coefficients. These correlation coefficients may then be combined to produce a final value indicative of correlation with the stored value data. For example, correlation values may be calculated between each column or line of sensed data and stored data. These correlation values may then be combined. Alternatively, correlation values based on 12 columns associated with each mode (transmission / reflectance) may be calculated and then the 2 values combined. Alternatively, a single correlation value for all data in the sensed and stored value sets may be calculated. The approach of calculating correlation coefficients for 3 columns of data and then combining them as described has been found to work well for U.S. currency. However, for other types of notes or documents, or for other forms of sensing hardware, other approaches to calculating correlation coefficients and then combining them, may also be found to work well in indicating the identity of the test note or document. Referring again to Figure 6, it should be noted that in the embodiment of the invention shown that generally the first four rows of sensed data and generally the last three rows of such data, are not correlated with the stored value sets when the bill is transversely aligned in the note path. Generally, the calculation of the level of correlation is made between sensed value sets and stored value sets comprising 22 rows and 24 columns. As later explained, the first four rows of data sensed from the note and the last at least three rows, are generally used to calculate whether the note is skewed in the transverse direction of the bill path as well as to confirm that the note is the proper length. If the note is skewed the control circuit generates stored value sets by selecting values from the data store which are correspondingly transposed to correspond to the calculated angle of skew. Further, as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art, if a note is "longer" than a proper note, such that it produces data for more test spots than it should, it is identified as a suspect or counterfeit note by the control circuit and is rejected or treated accordingly. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, notes passing the spot sensing assemblies on the transport need not be aligned either in the note direction or in a transverse direction to be identified. To achieve this, the data store includes data for all of the identifiable note types at a much closer spacing than the spacing between test spots detected by the spot sensing assemblies as a note passes. In the preferred form of the invention, the data is collected and stored for increments that are one-fourth the spacing between the test spots on a note passing in the transport. Of course, in other embodiments of the invention other increments may be used. In Figure 7 a sensed value set 38 is schematically represented. A first template 48 is representative of a particular type of note denomination that passes in centered relation relative to the 3 spot sensing assemblies in the transport. As a result, it is indicated in Figure 7 as having a "0" offset. The values shown in first template 48 are the 24 transmission and reflectance values for a note of a particular type at increments one-fourth the distance between the test spots on a passing note. Thus, in the preferred embodiment, first template 48 would be a matrix of 24 by (29 x 4) 116 values. Stored value sets for comparison to a sensed value set are derived from template 48 by the control circuit by taking the values in every fourth line from the template. In other words, the data in lines 1, 5, 9, 13, and so on, correspond to a note in a particular position relative to the direction a note moves in the transport. Similarly, lines 2, 6, 10, 14, and so on correspond to the same type of note in another position relative to the note direction. From the template 48, the control circuit generates stored value sets corresponding to the particular note type to which template 48 corresponds in varied positions relative to the note transport direction. In Figure 7, second template 50 corresponds to the same note type as note 48. Second template 50, however, has reflectance and transmission values for test spots on the note offset a transverse increment from the test spots which produced the values in first template 48. By taking every fourth line of values from template 50 the control circuit generates stored value sets for the particular type of note, transversely offset from the centered position and in various positions relative to the direction of note transport. Third template 52 shown in Figure 7 corresponds to the same type of note as templates 48 and 50. Template 52 contains values corresponding to test spots on the note shifted transversely from the zero offset position in an opposed direction from template 50. Third template 52 is also a matrix of 24 by 116 values. Stored value sets are produced therefrom by the control circuit by abstracting every fourth line of values. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, templates are provided for test spots at several transversely offset positions. This enables notes to be disposed from the centerline of the note path, as well to have a leading edge that is not aligned with any reference, and still be identified. The process of inputting the data necessary to produce the templates is accomplished in the preferred embodiment during a set up mode of the apparatus. In the set up mode, stored value data is generated by positioning a note of each type in the transport. Data is gathered by each spot sensing assembly from 116 lines of test spots instead of the 29 lines which is the usual number for a sensed note. This can be accomplished by static positioning of the note or, alternatively, by moving the note at a speed which enables the spot sensing assemblies to be sequenced sufficient times to gather the data for storage in the data store. During the set up mode, the notes are sensed while centered in the transport path as well as disposed transversely from the centered or "zero offset" position, so that the templates for notes that are transversely offset in increments are generated and stored. The ability to set up the device by using actual currency and passing it through the transport enables set up of forms of the apparatus in a rapid and reliable fashion. This is desirable where this data must be gathered for twenty notes, each of which has four orientations and several offset positions. In one embodiment of the invention, templates are produced for four offset positions in each transverse direction from the zero offset position. These templates are offset in increments of one-eighth of an inch. This means that a note passing through the transport may be positioned within one half inch in either transverse direction of the zero offset position and still be accurately identified. In other embodiments of the invention it is feasible to gather and/or compute the stored values experimentally and store them in templates in the data store. Alternatively, such templates may be produced in a separate machine and then loaded into the data store of the apparatus. Provided the data is accurately gathered, the apparatus will properly indicate the type of note sensed. The process by which the apparatus of the present invention calculates a level of correlation and determines the identity of a note is schematically represented in Figure 12. It should be understood that in the operation of apparatus 10 the control circuit 24 actuates the emitters of each of the spot sensing assemblies 18 in the sequence on a continuing basis. A note can arrive at any point during the sequence. As the note moves adjacent to and then passes the three spot sensing assemblies 18, the control circuit gathers the data at a step 54. The data gathered is arranged in memory as a matrix of values that is generally 24 by 29. This raw data is represented by matrix 56. Matrix 56 may actually contain more values if the note is skewed. However, for purposes of this initial example, a 24 by 29 matrix will be assumed which corresponds with a non-skewed note. As represented by 4 by 24 submatrix 58, the first four rows of data from the note are used by the control circuit to calculate a skew angle at a step 60 in a manner hereinafter discussed. Further, as represented by the 4 by 24 submatrix 62, control circuit 24 is operable to calculate the note length at a step 64. In doing this, the control circuit considers the skew angle, because the spot sensing assemblies will sense more than 29 rows of test spots on a note if the note is skewed. At step 64 the length of the note is determined based on the number of test spots from which data is received, and the skew angle. The note length is compared to a stored value indicative of the number of test spots for a standard note length, and if the note is "too long" or "too short" control circuit 24 generates a signal indicative of the condition sensed. Assuming for purposes of this example that the note is the correct length and transversely aligned with respect to the note path, the control circuit 24 is operative at a step 66 to generate stored value sets. The stored value sets are generated from templates 68. The nine templates 68 shown are each a matrix of 24 columns by 116 rows. The nine templates 68 comprise a master template 70 which corresponds to a note type (one note denomination in a particular orientation). Each of the nine templates 68 correspond to the note type in each of nine transverse positions in the note path. The 116 rows of data in each template 68 represent the transmission and reflectance values in increments one-fourth the distance between test spots on a sensed note that is passed through the transport. In the embodiment of the invention described, the nine 24 by 116 templates 68 comprise the master template 70 which includes all the stored values corresponding to one note type. Because the preferred form of the invention is configured to identify twenty notes in four orientations, there are eighty master templates in the data store in this preferred embodiment. Each of the master templates is comprised of nine templates, like templates 68. This means that in this preferred embodiment the data store holds (80 x 9 = 720) templates, each template having (24 x 116 - 2784) data values, for a total of (720 x 2784 = 2,004,480) stored values in the data store. Of course in other embodiments other template arrangements may be used. The control circuit 24 is operative in the example shown to produce forty-five stored value sets 72 from the templates 68 in each master template 70. These forty-five stored value sets are shown in a table in Figure 12. These stored value sets 72 are generated by the control circuit by taking every fourth line from each of the templates 68. The control circuit preferably does this starting with the sixteenth line in each of the templates 68. This is done because, as previously discussed, the first four rows of data taken from the note are used to calculate skew angle, and are generally not used in generating the stored value sets 72 if the note is not skewed. Forty-five stored value sets 72 are generated for each of the eighty templates 70. As can be appreciated from the foregoing discussion, with the first four rows of test spots being discarded, the first row of test spots on the note from which the data would be used for correlation purposes in this example would be the fifth row of test spots. This corresponds to the (4 x 5) twentieth line in each template 68. Thus the control circuit takes the twentieth line and every fourth line thereafter until 22 rows of data are read to generate a 22 by 24 stored value set 72. Stored value sets produced in this manner correspond to the "zero vertical position" in the table in Figure 12. However, because the note sensed may be shifted forward in the note path from the zero position, the control circuit 24 is operative to generate stored value sets 72 that are likewise shifted forward in the note direction. This is done by starting with the nineteenth line in each template 78 and taking every fourth line thereafter until 22 values are gathered. This corresponds a shift forward one increment. Stored value sets generated in this manner are the -1/4 stored value sets 72 shown in Figure 12. Likewise, stored value sets shifted two increments forward are generated starting with the eighteenth line of data in each of the templates 68 and taking every fourth line thereafter. This corresponds to the -2/4 stored value sets 72 shown in the table in Figure 12. As can be appreciated, stored value sets are also generated starting with the seventeenth line in each template 68. These correspond to the -3/4 stored value sets 72. Stored value sets starting with the sixteenth line correspond to the -4/4 stored value sets 72 in the table in Figure 12. The note may also be shifted rearwards from the "zero vertical position". As a result, stored value sets 72 are produced starting with the twenty-first, twenty-second, twenty-third, and twenty-fourth values in each of the templates 68. These correspond to the +1/4, +2/4, +3/4, and +4/4 vertical position stored value sets respectively shown in Figure 12. Stored value sets 72 are further generated for transverse offset positions. As shown in Figure 12 stored value sets are produced for transverse offset positions of -1/8", -218", + 1/8" and +218". (The " symbol is used herein with transverse offsets to represent approximately .635 cm. It should be noted that both vertical and transverse offsets are indicated in similarly evenly spaced increments, and that other similarly spaced increments in English or metric units may be used.) Thus, the 45 stored value sets 72 represent reflectance and transmission values for one note type shifted forward and backwards in the direction the note moves in the transport, as well as in both transverse directions. While the master templates 70 consist of nine transverse sub-templates 68, in the preferred form of the invention, stored value sets 72 are only produced for five transverse positions of the note, rather than nine. This is because the transport of the preferred embodiment and the manner in which the notes are delivered, generally maintain the notes within 1/4" of the zero offset position. For this reason in the preferred embodiment, it is not necessary to produce additional stored value sets. However, in alternative embodiments where the transverse position of the note may be further disposed from the zero offset position, additional stored value sets may be generated by the control circuit and used for correlation with the sensed value sets. - Referring again to Figure 12, the matrix of raw values 56 from a test note that is sensed undergoes a vertical de-skewing step 74 performed by the control circuit 24 when the note is sensed as skewed, as later explained. When the note is not skewed as in this example, step 74 has no effect on the raw data. In the present example, a sensed value set 76 which is a 24 by 22 matrix is produced by the control circuit 24 directly from the raw data. The control circuit 24 is then operative to calculate the level of correlation between the sensed value set 76 and each of the stored value sets 72 in the manner discussed with reference to Figure 6. Each of the correlation values is calculated and temporarily stored by the control circuit, which storage is represented by table 78. From all the correlation values calculated for each master template, one value will generally be the highest. Of course, there are eighty master templates and the control circuit is operative to find the highest level of correlation among the forty-five values for each of the 80 master templates. This is represented by a step 80 in Figure 12. The control circuit is then operative at a step 82 to provide an indication of the identity of the note type that produced the highest correlation value and therefore most closely correlates with the sensed value set from the note that passed through the apparatus. As previously discussed, embodiments of the invention also have stored in connection with the control circuit a threshold value which the highest level of correlation calculated must exceed before a note is considered genuine. If the highest level of correlation for all the stored value sets does not exceed this threshold level, then the note is suspect and potentially a counterfeit. Suspect notes of this type may be returned to a customer or held within the apparatus in a designated location. This is done by using a divert mechanism that transports notes to the designated location. Alternative embodiments of the invention may also be used to segregate notes that are considered in good condition from those that exhibit wear, abuse or soiled conditions. This is accomplished by having stored in connection with the control circuit 24 a further threshold value for correlation which is above the threshold for note genuineness, but below that for notes in suitable condition. Such an intermediate threshold may be used for purposes of segregating bank notes that, while still good, are sufficiently worn or soiled such that they should be removed from circulation. A further advantage of the present invention is that it may provide an indication of note type that includes note orientation. This enables the present invention to be coupled with mechanisms which reorient the note and segregate notes of different denominations. This enables the notes to be collected for bundling or for dispense to a user of the machine in which the apparatus of the present invention is installed. The present invention also provides capabilities for detecting counterfeit notes. This is achieved because the available data may be selectively processed by the control circuit in ways that are intended to assist in the detection of counterfeit notes. If, for example, it is known that counterfeit currency for a particular country tends to deviate significantly from actual currency either in reflection or transmission of a particular wavelength of radiation, or in a particular region of a note, the level of correlation for this particular wavelength or region of the note may be analyzed by the control circuit individually. Notes which exhibit the properties of a counterfeit may then be identified as suspect even through the overall level of correlation may be marginally acceptable. The particular properties which may distinguish a counterfeit note from a genuine note will depend on a particular currency or other document involved and its properties. A further advantage of the preferred embodiment of the present invention is that notes passing through the apparatus need not be aligned transversely in the note path. Rather, the notes may be skewed such that one of the transverse sides is ahead of the other. An example of a note 84 that is skewed relative to the note path is shown schematically in Figure 8. Note 84 is shown with its left side leading. Lines 86 which are superimposed on the note in Figure 8 show the lines or grid of test spots that would be sampled if the note were aligned in the note path. Lines 88 represent the lines of test spots on the skewed note that are tested by the spot sensing assemblies. Superimposed lines 90 represent where the spot sensing assemblies sense data. Therefore, the intersections of lines 90 and 88 represent a grid of locations where data is gathered by the spot sensing assemblies as the note 84 passes. A sensed value set 92 shown in Figure 9 shows the matrix of raw data that is generated as note 84 passes the spot sensing assemblies. The spot sensing assembly that is positioned toward the left in Figure 8 begins sensing data from the note before the spot sensing assembly in the center. Further, the spot sensing assembly in the center begins sensing data before the spot sensing assembly on the right. The spot sensing assemblies that do not sense the note sense a near zero reflectance value and a large transmission value. Similarly, at the trailing portion of the note which is shown by the bottom of the raw sensed value set 92, the spot sensing assemblies stop sensing the note at different times in a manner that is essentially a mirror image of the condition at the leading edge of the note. As can be appreciated from Figure 8, because of the skewed character of the note, the spot sensing assemblies sense data for more than 29 of the transverse lines 90. It will be recalled that 29 rows of test spots were sensed in the prior example for a non-skewed note. To analyze this data, the control circuit 24 of the apparatus of the present invention is operable to modify the raw sensed value set data 92 represented in Figure 9 so that it is similar to other sensed value sets for transversely aligned notes. The control circuit 24 of the invention is further operative to produce stored value sets which account for the angle of skew of the note. When a note is skewed, the control circuit 24 is first operative to modify the raw sensed value set 92 by transposing the data to eliminate the data points near the leading edge that represent the absence of a note. This involves shifting the values on the right for each type of emitter as shown in Figure 9, upwardly so that a sensed value set is created in which the sensed note data is present in each position in the 29 rows. Such a modified sensed value set is indicated 94 in Figure 10. As shown in Figure 10, by shifting the raw values, a sensed value set which is a matrix of 24 by 29 sensed values is produced. Although the data was gathered from more than 29 of the transverse lines 90 when the bill was sensed, the modified sensed value set 94 "squares up" the sensed data so that it is a similar sensed value set to a transversely aligned note. Such "squared up" data is usable by the control circuit for purposes of checking to see if the note sensed is the proper length. If after "squaring up" the raw data the data does not correspond to the length of a proper note, an appropriate indication of a suspect note is given. As can be appreciated from Figure 8, the modification of raw sensed value set 92 to create sensed value set 94 does not result in a matrix of values that can be readily correlated with templates for notes that are aligned in the note path. This is because the test spots on skewed note 84 progressively move closer to the right edge of the note as the note passes. The rate at which the test spots on the note migrate toward the right is a function of the skew angle. To enable correlation of the modified sensed value set 94 with stored value sets, the control circuit 24 is operable to generate stored value sets for correlation that account for the angle of skew. This is graphically represented in Figure 11. Figure 11 shows a modified sensed value set schematically indicated 96. This modified sensed value set 96 for purposes of this example can be envisioned as corresponding to a note like that in Figure 8 where the note is skewed such that the left side in the frame of reference leads the right side. The control circuit is operable based on the calculated angle of skew of the note to take values from different sub-templates 68 in the master template 70 as graphically represented in Figure 12. As shown on the right in Figure 11, the values in columns 98, 100, and 102 represent the templates similar to sub-templates 68 for a 0" horizontal offset, +1/8" horizontal offset, and 2/8" horizontal offset respectively as shown in Figure 12. To generate a stored value set for correlation with modified sensed value set 96, the control circuit 24 is operative to select a series of values from the 0" offset template represented by column 98. The control circuit is then operative to "jump" so as to begin selecting values from column 100 which corresponds to the template 68 for the same note type transposed + 1/8" from the 0" offset position. Further, after taking several values from column 100 the control circuit is operative to begin selecting values from column 102 which is representative of the template for the same note type disposed +218" from the 0" offset position. The point where the control circuit 24 begins selecting values from the different templates is determined by the angle of skew. Stored value sets are generated for all positions of the note disposed within 1/4" of the zero reference in the note path in a similar manner. As can be appreciated from the graphic representation in Figure 11, to generate stored value sets that encompass the possible positions for a skewed note, the control circuit must abstract values from templates 68 for notes that are disposed more than 1/4" away from the zero offset position. As can now be appreciated from Figure 12, this is why there are additional transverse offset templates 68 in each master template 70, even though the note is generally confined to an area plus or minus 1/4" from the zero - offset position in the note path. The calculation of the skew angle which determines how the control circuit selects or abstracts values from the various templates to produce the stored value sets, is explained with reference to Figures 14 and 15. Figure 15 shows a note 104 which is skewed in a manner similar to note 84 in Figure 8. Note 104 has a left side leading a right-side in a direction of note travel indicated by Arrow A. A spot sensing assembly 106 is positioned to the left as shown in Figure 15. A spot sensing assembly 108 is positioned to the right as shown in Figure 16. Both of the spot sensing assemblies are the same and similar to spot sensing assemblies 18 previously discussed. Line 110 in Figure 15 is representative of the reflectance values for a first emitter type to have produced radiation which is reflected from note 104 in an amount above a set threshold 112. This threshold is indicated as 20 percent in Figure 14 which has been found through experimentation to be an acceptable value for this purpose when using U.S. currency notes. Of course other threshold values may be used. Data points 114 are representative of the actual reflectance values for the particular type emitter in spot sensing assembly 106 which was the first of the emitters to produce a reflectance value above the threshold. Line 110 is produced by a curve fitting process carried out by control circuit 24 using actual data points 114. This is done through execution of known curve fitting algorithms. Line 116 is fitted by the control circuit to data points 118. Data points 118 are representative of the actual reflectance values from the emitter type in spot sensing assembly 108 that corresponds to the emitter that produced data points 114 in spot sensing assembly 106. By comparing the times at which the lines 110 and 116 each crossed the threshold 112, the skew angle of the note may be calculated. This difference in time in which reflectance values for the same emitter type in each of the spot sensing assemblies crossed the threshold is represented by the quantity Δt in Figure 14. The distance between spot sensing assemblies 106 and 108 is a known fixed quantity. Similarly the speed at which the note moves on the note transport is also known. As shown in Figure 15 the angle of skew θ can be calculated by the following equation: tanθ=ν⁢Δ⁢tx where:
θis the angle of skew;vis the velocity of the note in the note direction;Δtis the difference in time between when the first emitter in a first spot sensing assembly senses the property of the note crossing the threshold, and when the corresponding emitter in the furthest disposed spot sensing assembly senses the property for that assembly crossing the threshold;xis the distance between the spot sensing assemblies 106, 108 for which the time difference is evaluated. As can be appreciated from the foregoing discussion, the angle of skew determines the points at which the control circuit begins selecting values from the templates to produce the stored value sets for comparison to the modified sensed value set. Of course, the angle of skew may be in either direction which necessitates that the control circuit be enabled to abstract values from templates 68 progressively in either transverse offset direction. Referring again to Figure 12 which shows the correlation sequence, step 74 is the de-skewing step in which the raw sensed value set from the spot sensing assemblies like set 92 in Figure 9 is "squared up" to produce a modified sensed value set similar to set 94 in Figure 10. When the data is skewed this step is done to produce the sensed value set 76 in Figure 12 for purposes of correlation. In step 66 the stored value sets are produced by the control circuit by abstracting data from the templates 68 in each master template 70, responsive to the skew angle detected. Thus, in the example represented in Figure 12, values are abstracted from the 0" offset template 68 and the +1/8 offset template 68 to generate the stored value set 72 in the table of stored value sets the 0 vertical and 0" horizontal offset position. As will be appreciated from the prior discussion, for the stored value sets 72 shown in the table above the 0 position, shifts between the two adjacent templates 68 occur one line of data higher with each -1/4 step upward in the table of stored value sets. Similarly, the shift between the templates would occur one data line downward for each + 1/4 increment below the 0 vertical offset position in the table of stored value sets. For example, to generate the stored value set 72 shown in the table having a 0 vertical offset and a horizontal offset position of -1/8", values on the corresponding lines highlighted in Figure 12 in the 0" horizontal offset template, would instead be taken from the template having a horizontal offset of -1/8". Likewise, the lines shown highlighted in Figure 12 in the +1/8" horizontal offset template, would instead be taken from the 0" horizontal offset template. Similarly, lines of data would be abstracted from these two templates by the control circuit 24 one data line upward from the values used to produce the 0, -1/8" stored value set, to generate the stored value set shown in the table at -1/4", -1/8". Abstracting values from the templates two data lines upward from the values used to generate the 0, -1/8" stored value set, provides the -2/4, -1/8 stored value set and so on. Similarly abstracting values from the two templates used to produce the 0, -1/8" stored value set 72, provides the +1/4, -1/8"; +2/4, -1/8"; +3/4, -1/8" and +4/4, -1/8" stored value sets. This is done by abstracting values successively one data line lower than those abstracted to produce the prior stored value set. Likewise, to produce the stored value set 72 in the 0 vertical offset, -2/8 horizontal offset position, the control circuit 24 abstracts values from the -2/8" and -1/8" horizontal offset templates 68, and so on. It can be appreciated that the selection process executed by the control circuit 24 to generate the stored value sets for comparison with the sensed value set 76 can be visualized as a matter of shifting left-right among the templates 68 and up and down within the templates 68 to produce the various stored value sets 72 shown in the table positions in Figure 12. It should be remembered however, that even though values are abstracted or selected to produce the stored valued sets 72, all the selected values in a stored value set come from a single master template 70 which corresponds to a single note denomination having a particular orientation. As a result, when the values indicating levels of correlation are calculated and the highest one is found, the stored value set which produced this highest level of correlation will correspond to only one type identity. The control circuit 24 of the preferred embodiment is schematically represented in Figure 13. The control circuit 24 includes an optical sensors and electronics component 120. The optical sensors and electronics component includes the spot sensing assemblies 18 which produce the first and second signals which cause the control circuit 24 to generate the reflectance and transmission values. The control circuit further includes a scanning control subassembly 122 which is in connection with the optical sensors and electronics component 120. The scanning control subassembly 122 actuates the emitters in the sequence to produce the synchronized first and second signals which correspond to each emitter type. A multiplexer and analog to digital (A/D) converter component 124 is operative to receive the first and second signals from the spot sensing assemblies and to produce the raw reflectance and transmission values and to direct them to generate the sensed value set for each sensed note. The control circuit 24 further includes an auxiliary sensors subassembly 126. The auxiliary sensors subassembly corresponds to the auxiliary sensors 28 previously discussed. These auxiliary sensors are preferably a type particularly tailored to the document or note type being sensed. A module controller 128 is operative to receive data from and to control the operation of the other components of the system. The controller 128 is in connection with an angle encoder subassembly 130. The angle encoder subassembly 130 is operative to determine the skew angle of a note from the initial emitter signals as the note is sensed in the manner previously discussed. The control circuit 24 further includes a communications subassembly 132 which is operative to transmit signals to and from the controller 128. The communications subassembly transmits information to and from a larger system of which the apparatus is a part. It also delivers signals to and from input and output devices. The controller 128 is in communication with a plurality of calculator modules 134. Each calculator module 134 includes a digital signal processor 136. Each digital signal processor 136 is in operative connection with a static random access memory 138. The memories 138 hold the stored values which are used to determine the level of correlation between the sensed value set and the generated stored value sets. Each memory 138 preferably holds a different group of the master templates 70. Each calculator module 134 further includes a calculator controller 140. The calculator controllers are operative to produce the stored value sets from the templates in the memories 138. This is done based on angle of skew data provided by the controller 128. The calculator controllers are further operative to cause their associated digital signal processor to calculate the correlation values between the data values in the sensed value set and the stored value sets. The calculator controllers are further operative to control the associated digital signal processor to calculate the overall correlation coefficient for each stored value set, and to indicate the highest correlation value for the master templates handled by the particular calculator module. The architecture of the preferred form of the control circuit 24 enables rapidly carrying out large numbers of calculations which are necessary to generate the stored value sets and to determine the correlation values for the sensed value set and all the stored value sets. The control circuit 24 has the advantage that each of the digital signal processors operates in parallel on the master templates stored in its associated memory. In addition, the processing capabilities of control circuit 24 may be increased by adding additional calculator and modules 134 to generate and correlate additional stored value sets. This enables correlating selective or additional sensed values with stored data. In operation of the control circuit 24 the controller 128 operates the scanning control subassembly 122 to sequence the emitters in the spot sensing assemblies, which are included in the optical sensors and electronics subassembly 120. The first and second signals corresponding to reflectance and transmission from each emitter are delivered to the multiplexer and A/D converter 124 which delivers digital reflectance and transmission values corresponding to each emitter. The multiplexer and A/D converter 124 also receives signals from the auxiliary sensors and electronics subassembly 126 and delivers appropriate signals from these to the controller 128 as well. The controller 128 is operable to sense a note entering into proximity with the spot sensing assemblies and to produce the raw sensed value set. The angle encoder subassembly 130 is operative to determine the angle of skew from the raw sensed value set and to deliver the information to the controller 128. The controller 128 is further operative to modify the raw sensed value set and to deliver the modified sensed value set and the angle of skew data to each of the calculator modules 134. The controller 128 is operative to determine the note length from the modified sensed value set and compare it to the length for a standard note based on the number of test spots obtained. If the sensed note does not have the proper length a signal indicative thereof is generated, and further processing for that note is not conducted. Each calculator module 134 is operative to generate stored value sets from the stored values in the master templates in memories 138 based on the angle of skew. The calculator modules are further operative to calculate the correlation coefficient values for the modified sensed value set and each of the generated stored value sets. Each calculator module stores and communicates to the controller 128 the calculated overall correlation coefficient value for each of the generated stored value sets. Each calculator module provides this information along with the data identifying the master template which was used to generate the stored value sets, to controller 128, along with other selected correlation data that the calculator modules may have been programmed to provide. The controller is operative to receive the signals from each of the calculator modules and to determine which master template produced the highest level of correlation with the sensed value set. The controller module is further operative to determine if the correlation value which is the highest, is over a first threshold which indicates that the level of correlation is likely to be indicative of the note type associated with the particular master template. The controller 128 then transmits signals to the communication subassembly 132 indicative of the note type identified or signals indicative that the note identified is suspect because its highest correlation level is not above the threshold. In alternative embodiments, the controller 128 may test to determine if the correlation value exceeds other thresholds and transmit signals indicative of the fitness of the note for further use, or other signals relating to the genuineness or suspect character of the note. The communication subassembly 132 transmits signals to a communications bus connected to the apparatus of the present invention and to other devices and systems which are operative to further process the note or provide information about the note. While in the preferred embodiment of the control circuit 24 is adapted to performing the calculating functions required for identifying the types of notes, in other embodiments other control circuit configurations may be used. Further, in the preferred form of the control circuit 24 the memories 38 which make up the data store may be programmed through the apparatus. This may be done in a setup mode as discussed by selectively positioning sample notes and moving them in controlled relation adjacent the spot sensing assemblies to gather the data necessary to produce the master templates. This is done by having the module controller 128 control the operation of the note transport to move the sample notes at a speed which will enable gathering data at all the desired locations on the note. The controller 128 may also be programmed in the setup mode to receive signals indicative of the note type, and the transverse offset positions of the note used to provide template data in the memories 138 which comprise the data store. Alternatively, the stored data may be produced in a different apparatus and loaded into the memories 138 through the controller 128 or from another source. In this approach stored values may be gathered from static analysis of sample notes. In the preferred embodiment the optical sensors and electronic subassembly 120 further includes a compensator circuit that facilitates calibration of the spot sensing assemblies. In the preferred form of the invention the optical sensors and electronic subassembly is calibrated using a selected standard grade of white paper which is passed through the note transport adjacent to the spot sensing assemblies. In the calibration mode the optical sensors and electronic subassembly 120 is operative to adjust the amount of radiation generated by each of emitters to produce a preset output. This ensures that the level of radiation produced by each of the emitters is sufficient to correlate accurately with the stored value sets that are produced. Of course in other embodiments of the invention other types or reference material may be used for purposes of calibration. Periodic calibration of the optical sensors and electronic subassembly 120 ensures that changes in the emitters over time or changes in the optical path due to accumulation of dust or other contaminants, will not adversely impact the accuracy of the apparatus. Due to the nature of light emitting diodes (LEDs) used for the emitters and the nature of the control circuitry which generally responds to relative values rather than absolute values, in the preferred embodiment calibration is required infrequently. As can be appreciated from the foregoing description, the preferred embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention presents the advantage that it is capable of identifying notes that are presented in any orientation. It further operates to identify notes at high speed and without the need to have the notes precisely aligned or positioned with respect to a frame of reference. The preferred embodiment of the present invention further has the advantage that it is readily adaptable to different types of currency notes or other document types, and can be used to detect suspect or counterfeit notes. The preferred form of the present invention is also readily adaptable to different types of notes, and may be programmed to simultaneously identify notes from different countries which have different properties and which are different sizes. Further, due to the data available, the preferred form of the present invention may be programmed to analyze certain sensed values in greater detail to point out characteristics that may be associated with unsuitably worn or counterfeit notes. The preferred embodiment of the present invention further presents the advantage that it is rapidly configured, programmed, readily calibrated and does not require frequent adjustment. Thus, the new universal bank note denominator and validater apparatus of the present invention achieves the above stated objectives, eliminates difficulties encountered in the use of prior devices and systems, solves problems, and attains the desirable results described herein. In the foregoing description, certain terms have been used for brevity, clarity, and understanding. However, no unnecessary limitations are to be implied therefrom because such terms are for descriptive purposes and are intended to be broadly construed. Moreover, the descriptions and illustrations given herein are by way of examples and the invention is not limited to the exact details shown or described. In the following claims, any feature described as a means for performing a function shall be construed as encompassing any means capable of performing the recited function and shall not be deemed limited to the particular means shown as performing the recited function in the foregoing description, or mere equivalents. Having described the features, discoveries, and principles of the invention, the manner in which it is constructed and operated and the advantages and useful results attained; the new and useful elements, arrangements, parts, combinations, systems, equipment, operations, methods, processes, and relationships are set forth in the appended claims.
