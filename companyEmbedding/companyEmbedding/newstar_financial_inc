NewStar Financial Arranges Financing For Zenith Products Corporation
Supports Acquisition by CharlesBank Capital Partners

Boston, MA, November 1, 2005 - NewStar Financial, Inc. ("NewStar"), a Boston-based specialty finance company, announces that it has provided a senior credit facility to support Charlesbank Capital Partners' ("Charlesbank") acquisition of Zenith Product Corporation ("Zenith" or the "Company") from Masco Corporation. Charlesbank, also based in Boston, is a leading private equity investor in the middle market.

Zenith, which was founded in 1946, has developed a full suite of bathroom-related products and is a leading manufacturer of bathroom storage and organizational products. It manufactures a variety of finishes, materials, sizes, and innovative designs that enable homeowners to make maximum use of bathroom space. Zenith's products are distributed nationally through home centers, mass merchants, and bath specialty shops.

NewStar served as Joint Lead Arranger and Administrative Agent for the senior credit facilities comprised of a revolving credit facility, a five-year term loan, and a six-year term loan. The amount and terms of the senior facilities, subordinated debt, and equity investments were not disclosed.

NewStar was assisted in the structuring and syndication of the transaction by Madison Capital Funding LLC, who was Joint Lead Arranger and Syndication Agent for the transaction. Other investors included Friedberg Milstein, Golub Capital, and GSC Partners.

"It was a pleasure to work with Charlesbank on the transaction," said Managing Director Mark Cordes of NewStar, "The financing demonstrates NewStar's ability to successfully arrange and execute on larger transactions for leading private equity firms. The facilities also exhibit the firm's ability to bring together a diverse group of financial institutions as a result of deep relationships with the leveraged finance community."

"Newstar was a true value-added partner throughout this process and very helpful in structuring the debt deal," said Jon Biotti, Vice President at Charlesbank.

Joining Cordes on NewStar's deal teal for the transaction were Rob Hornstein, Keith Cox, Michael Purcell, and Jason Andreotes.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score

Value Score
