The company markets MAX-D technology, which improves various types of audio, as well as compressed audio and video as used in mp3 files, iPods, Internet, and satellite/terrestrial broadcasting.

It serves consumer electronics, motion picture, broadcasting, video game, recording, cell phone, Internet, and VOIP markets. The company was formerly known as So Act Network, Inc. and changed its name to Max Sound Corporation in March 2011. Max Sound Corporation was founded in 2005 and is based in Santa Monica, California. SNNLive spoke with John Blaisure, President & CEO of Max Sound Corporation at the 6th Annual LD Micro Conference 2013 in Bel Air, CA.
Using new technology to improve the quality of audio, John Blaisure explains his product as an, “audio technology that restores all audio to high-definition audio. The way it works is it is a software [that] sees all the audio data that has been compressed and then restores it real time. That exposes all that data so that when any other application sees it, it’s seen as almost studio-quality audio data which most people have never heard before.”
While other companies such as Dolby, “create a surround sound feel, if our process is installed in front of Dolby, we just make Dolby sound better.” When asked to pick the best application for his software, Blaisure concludes by choosing their licensing agreement with Qualcomm, which is based “on licensed technology that resides on the chip that goes out over 2.5 billion phones in the next 36 months with full adoption by Qualcomm. Now everyone gets HD audio across all devices and then we would move into other audios as in cars, televisions, and streaming.”

Max Sound Corp. Files Two Lawsuits Against Google, Accusing Search Giant of Misappropriating Proprietary Digital Video Streaming Technology

		  Trade secret and patent infringement suits allege Google misappropriated tech company's patented methods for streaming video compression used in Android, YouTube, Chrome and other platforms; case filed by law firms Grant & Eisenhofer, Buether Joe & Carpenter, and Walkup, Melodia, Kelly & Schoenberger.

WILMINGTON, Del. and SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 12, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Cutting edge audio technology company Max Sound Corp. (OTCQB: MAXD) has filed trade secret and patent infringement lawsuits in two separate courts against Google and its subsidiaries YouTube and On2 Technologies.
The suits allege that Google misappropriated proprietary and patented Optimized Data Transmission technology owned by UK-based Vedanti Systems Ltd. and its sole shareholder – VSL Communications Ltd. (collectively, "VSL") and brought forth in conjunction with Max Sound Corp. ("Max Sound"),  which acquired the right to enforce VSL's intellectual property rights.
Noted litigation law firm Grant & Eisenhofer filed the two suits on behalf of Max Sound and VSL. The patent infringement complaint was brought in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, and the trade secret suit was filed in Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.  Intellectual property law firm Buether Joe & Carpenter is co-counsel in both suits, while prominent West Coast firm Walkup, Melodia, Kelly & Schoenberger is co-counsel in the trade secret action.
The lawsuits contend that Google executives met with VSL over several months in 2010 to discuss the possibility of licensing or acquiring VSL's patented Optimized Data Transmission and other proprietary methods, which greatly enhance the streaming of audio and video files online.  At the time, Google's own existing standards resulted in "jittery, low-quality video and sound for large-sized files," the patent complaint notes. 
Throughout 2010, VSL claims that Google gained access to and received technical guidance regarding VSL's proprietary codec, a computer program capable of encoding or decoding a digital data stream or signal.  As the complaint notes, VSL's codec "implemented a proprietary and unique system of optimizing data transmission using methods for key frame positioning, slicing and analyzing pixel selection of video content to significantly reduce the volume of digital video files, while minimizing any resulting loss of video quality."  By any measure, VSL's technology was far superior to what Google had possessed to that point for streaming dense video files online.
The complaints allege that soon after the two companies initiated negotiations, Google began implementing VSL's technology into its own WebM/VP8 video codec without informing VSL, and without compensating it for its use. The WebM/VP8 video codec is widely used by Google in numerous products and websites, including YouTube.com, Google TV, the Android operating system, and Chrome web browser, significantly improving delivery of video content to desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. 
 
Plaintiffs are seeking injunctive relief against Google and compensatory damages, as well as treble damages, in view of the willful nature of the alleged infringement.
"The use of new technology by established companies should be based on original creation and innovation," said Adam Levitt, head of Grant & Eisenhofer's Consumer Protection practice who is representing the plaintiffs. "VSL created groundbreaking digital video technology — technology that has forever changed the way that video content is streamed and displayed over the Internet." 
The lawsuits allege that Google wilfully infringed VSL's patent and was fully aware of the value of its technology, while simultaneously recognizing the shortcomings of its own video streaming capabilities at the time.  Plaintiffs further allege that Google met with VSL under false pretenses and misappropriated its proprietary codec and other, non-patented, methods, incorporating it into Google's own video technology – thus violating Google's core 'Don't Be Evil' maxim.  Both suits seek to hold Google accountable for its alleged patent infringement and trade secret misappropriation.
The cases are captioned as: Vedanti Systems Ltd. and Max Sound Corp. v. Google, Inc., YouTube, LLC, and On2 Technologies, Inc., No. 1:14-cv-01029 (D. Del., filed Aug. 9, 2014) and Max Sound Corp., VSL Communications Ltd., et al. v. Google, Inc., et al., No. 114-cv-269231 (Cal. Sup. Ct.).
