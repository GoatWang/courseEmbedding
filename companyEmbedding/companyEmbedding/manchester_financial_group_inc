Experience

					Founded in 1970, Manchester Financial Group is headquartered in San Diego, California. The company specializes in and focuses on hotel and commercial property development. Manchester Financial Group and its subsidiaries have been instrumental in developing downtown San Diego's waterfront, paving the way for the city of San Diego's burgeoning convention industry, while also founding two banks and establishing an extensive and diverse investment portfolio. The company is an integral part of San Diego's economic landscape, developing important business properties including the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego, the San Diego Marriott Marquis & Marina and downtown San Diego's First National Bank building. In the La Jolla area, the company developed the Manchester Business and Research Park, Torrey Executive Centre and the Manchester Financial Building. Further north, Manchester Financial Group's most talked about premier resort and spa, Fairmont Grand Del Mar, combines a luxury hotel with palatial residential villas. Set within San Diego's only Tom Fazio-designed golf course, The Grand Golf Club boasts 18 magnificent holes kissed with fresh coastal breezes. Beyond San Diego, in the "Great Northwest," the Manchester Financial Group developed the Whitetail Club & Resort, a luxury golf resort and private residence community on the shores of Payette Lake in McCall, Idaho.
