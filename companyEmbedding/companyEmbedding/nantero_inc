Today’s automobiles are intelligent, connected and starting to offer innovative new features such as advanced infotainment systems and self-driving modes. In order for this trend to continue, healing automotive manufacturers need a new generation of memory that can process large amounts of data quickly and efficiently while also being able to endure the rough conditions and high temperatures found in vehicles.
Nantero’s super-fast,  ultra-high density non-volatile NRAM® is that next generation of memory. Based on carbon nanotubes, which are stronger than steel and as hard as diamond, NRAM features high endurance (proven to operate for orders of magnitude more cycles than flash) and also delivers high reliability (will retain memory for >1,000 years at 85 degrees Celsius or more than 10 years at 300 degrees Celsius.) This endurance, along with NRAM’s low power, small size and high performance, makes it the ideal memory to power the more sophisticated and intelligent cars of the future.

「Yole Développementが2015年1月に出した『新生の不揮発性メモリ技術と市場動向』レポートで、この市場が2014年には6,500万ドル相当の価値があったことを発見しました。 ですが、現在は岐路に立たされています。 従来のDRAMやフラッシュメモリにはスケーラビリティと速度に限界があるという問題を解決するため、STTMRAM、RRAM、NRAMおよび他の技術から適切な新不揮発メモリを選択する、ということを業界リーダーが今から2年以内に行わなければなりません。 このような状況にあるなか、Yole DéveloppementはNanteroが出した最新のNRAMの技術結果を大変喜ばしく思っています。 Nanteroの技術はSTTMRAMのパフォーマンスと、また可能性としてRRAMの低コストも提供できます。 Yole Développementでは、主流のメモリアプリケーションをターゲットに、DRAMやフラッシュにとって代わるであろうこの技術の今後のスケーラビリティに注目しています。」

“In Yole Développement’s January 2015 Emerging Non Volatile Memory Technology and Market Trends report, we found that this market was worth $65M in 2014. However, it’s now at a crossroads. The choice between STTMRAM, RRAM, NRAM and other technologies for the right emerging NVM should be made in the next two years by the industry’s leaders in order to solve traditional DRAM and flash memory's limited scalability and/or speed. In these circumstances, Yole Développement is really excited by Nantero’s latest NRAM technical results. Nantero’s technology provides both the performance of STTMRAM and potentially the low cost of RRAM.

Industrial 


Industrial applications such as factories, oil and gas,  power plants and water treatment facilities require substantial amounts of data to be stored and analyzed continuously, and the conditions at some of these locations can be harsh.
That is one of the key reasons that Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services company, invested in Nantero and its development of NRAM® memory. Based on carbon nanotubes, which are stronger than steel and as hard as diamond, NRAM features high endurance and also delivers high reliability:

Proven to operate for orders of magnitude more cycles than flash.
Will retain memory for >1,000 years at 85 degrees Celsius or more than 10 years at 300 degrees Celsius.

This endurance, along with NRAM’s low power, small size and high performance, makes it ideal for even the most extreme conditions found in the industrial market.
Contact Nantero to learn more about its NRAM today.

Nantero, Inc. Key Developments

Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited and Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited Reaches Agreement with Nantero, Inc
Aug 31 16
Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited and Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited announced that they have reached an agreement with Nantero Inc. to license that company's technology for NRAM, non-volatile RAM using carbon nanotubes, and to conduct joint development towards releasing a product based on 55-nm process technology. Three companies are aiming to develop a product using NRAM non-volatile RAM that achieves several 1,000 times faster rewrites and many thousands of times more rewrite cycles than embedded flash memory, making it potentially capable of replacing DRAM with non-volatile memory. Fujitsu Semiconductor plans to develop an NRAM-embedded custom LSI product by the end of 2018, with the goal of expanding the product line-up into stand-alone NRAM product after that. Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor, which is a pure-play foundry, plans to offer NRAM-based technology to its foundry customers.

Fujitsu, Nantero Collaborate on NRAM Product DevelopmentYou are here:HomeNews WireFujitsu, Nantero Collaborate on NRAM Product DevelopmentAugust 31, 2016Leave a commentNews WireBy News Desk

by Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited and Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor Limited today announced that they have reached an agreement with US-based Nantero, Inc. to license that company's technology for NRAM, non-volatile RAM using carbon nanotubes, and to conduct joint development towards releasing a product based on 55-nm process technology.Three companies are aiming to develop a product using NRAM non-volatile RAM that achieves several 1000 times faster rewrites and many thousands of times more rewrite cycles than embedded flash memory, making it potentially capable of replacing DRAM with non-volatile memory. Fujitsu Semiconductor plans to develop an NRAM-embedded custom LSI product by the end of 2018, with the goal of expanding the product line-up into stand-alone NRAM product after that. Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor, which is a pure-play foundry, plans to offer NRAM-based technology to its foundry customers.Comment from Masato Matsumiya, System Memory VP, Fujitsu Semiconductor
Non-volatile memory using Nantero's carbon-nanotube technology is a marked advance beyond conventional technology. Fujitsu Semiconductor has been designing and producing FRAM, a type of non-volatile RAM, since the late 90s, and is one of the few companies to have integrated FRAM design and production capabilities. We will be able to build on our experience and skill in this field to develop and produce NRAM as well. The combination of Nantero's technology with our design and production capabilities promises to meet the longstanding needs of our customers for non-volatile memory that is higher density, faster, more energy efficiency, and with a higher rewrite cycle.I am confident that Nantero and Fujitsu Semiconductor will become partners with the highest mutual regard, and I look forward to working with Nantero to develop memory with revolutionary performance. As always, Fujitsu Semiconductor is committed to offering a more complete range of memory solutions, and to meeting the needs of its customers.Comment from Masahiro Chijiiwa, Director and Corporate SVP, Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor
Nantero's NRAM technology is based on carbon nanotubes and allows for non-volatile memory with high density and random access, promising to expand Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor's line of embedded non-volatile memory products, which are a major focus of our business. In working with Nantero to develop their technology into products and license that technology, together with Fujitsu Semiconductor, I am certain we will be able to offer our customers new kinds of non-volatile random-access memory solutions.Comment from Greg Schmergel, Co-Founder, Chairman & CEO, Nantero, Inc.
Fujitsu Semiconductor and Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor are ideal commercialization partners for Nantero as their experience with FRAM makes them among the world's most successful companies in mass production of new memory devices. Nantero is honored to be working with them on breakthrough memory products, and after years of intensive evaluation of our NRAM technology, our three companies have built a very strong relationship.Through over a decade of intensive R&D, Nantero has been able to bring CNT-based memory technology to a state of maturity and manufacturing readiness where world-class companies such as Fujitsu Semiconductor and Mie Fujitsu Semiconductor are working with us on productization for multiple markets.  NRAM technology, with its combination of nonvolatility, high speed and high density, is uniquely positioned to allow for the continued evolution of memory beyond the projected limits and capabilities of classical technologies.About Fujitsu Semiconductor

“In Yole Développement’s January 2015 Emerging Non Volatile Memory Technology and Market Trends report, we found that this market was worth $65M in 2014. However, it’s now at a crossroads. The choice between STTMRAM, RRAM, NRAM and other technologies for the right emerging NVM should be made in the next two years by the industry’s leaders in order to solve traditional DRAM and flash memory's limited scalability and/or speed. In these circumstances, Yole Développement is really excited by Nantero’s latest NRAM technical results. Nantero’s technology provides both the performance of STTMRAM and potentially the low cost of RRAM. At Yole Développement, we are keen to see the future scalability of this technology that would enable it to target mainstream memory applications and replace DRAM and flash.”
