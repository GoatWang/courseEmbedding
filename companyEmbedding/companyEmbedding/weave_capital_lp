The Company seeks to address the unmet African demand for trade finance, estimated at US$120 billion by the African Development Bank (AfDB), by promoting two innovative companies: i) Savia Trade Asset Management, an asset management company that will, for the first time, promote African trade finance assets as a new asset class for international and regional asset managers; and ii) Savia Trade Finance Impact Fund, an evergreen trade finance debt fund directed to provide trade finance to African farmer cooperatives, the agribusiness supply chain and SMEs leveraging a blended finance pool to mitigate credit risk.
At least 50% of the Company’s activities will be directed to the agribusiness value chain.

 
 



 
 


 
 



Tiserin Capital is  a novel south-south private  equity fund  that  targets $100+  million in  capital commitments to “weave” partnerships  between  Sub-Saharan  African  mid-cap companies and companies from Asia and Latin America, two  regions that have seen similar socio-economic and urbanization trends to those observed  in today’s Sub-Saharan Africa.   For example, Indonesia and  Philippines saw considerable changes to their  business environment once the  countries crossed the $2,500  GDP per capita post  ‘98-99 Asia crisis. Urbanization  has since  doubled to  close to  50%, and  modern food  retailing has  grown five times to  60% of all  food purchases, eclipsing  sales from mom and  pop shops and  wet markets.  Modern retailing  brought about  enormous changes  to agricultural  supply  chains and  FMCG  sectors  and, more importantly, better service and product choices to  low income consumers, the largest consumer segments in these countries.  Companies from these regions can bring their industrial, logistics, product and marketing know-how uniquely fitting to sub-Saharan Africa’s demographic and urbanizing realities.

CVG Capital is sponsoring the Peruvian Agribusiness Impact Fund (PAF), an operating fund that seeks to promote joint ventures between farming communities in rural areas of Peru and sustainable agribusiness firms using peak agri-technology. Poverty in rural Peru affects about 30% of the population in the Andean and Amazon regions, approximately 3.2 million persons.  Agriculture remains the main source of income, but poor productivity and shifting cultivation produce subsistence food such as maize, rice, cassava, bananas, potatoes, grains etc.  This situation is aggravated by lower yields and inadequate alternatives for climate change.  Poverty accelerates migration to larger cities creating pressure in inadequate prepared urban areas.
Peruvian Andean and Amazonas regions are the center of origin and genetic diversity for many traditional crops like potato, corn, cacao, vanilla, annatto, avocado, hearts of palm, and also new crops such as quinoa, acai, camu camu and tropical spices for industrial use.  The sustainable production of these species holds the key to alleviate poverty in these regions.
The Peruvian Agribusiness Impact Fund will balance profitability and environmental and social sustainability to develop innovative agribusiness projects in the rural areas of the Amazonas and Sierra regions of Peru. PAF will promote the production and exports of high value crop in these regions while supporting rural farmers to increase yields, access capital and access markets through PAF.

Cumberland Farms Shedding Gulf Oil Business
Haseotes family makes $1B deal with private equity firm ArcLight.

June 2, 2015, 04:57 pm



 



FRAMINGHAM, Mass. — The New England convenience and fuel retailing landscape continues to change rapidly. Just days after 7-Eleven Inc. announced its planned purchase of Tedeschi Food Shops Inc., the Haseotes family, owner of Cumberland Farms Inc., is reportedly selling off its Gulf Oil LP fuel business.
According to a source close to the transaction, the business will be sold to Boston-based private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners for more than $1 billion.
As first reported by Oil Price Information Service (OPIS), Gulf employees were told of the pending move at the company's Framingham headquarters in May.
Sunoco LP, Speedway LLC parent Marathon Petroleum Corp. and Global Partners LP were among the finalists that also submitted "ambitious bids" for Gulf Oil, which had been up for bid since October, OPIS reported.
The deal with ArcLight could close as early as late July or early August, a source told CSNews Online. Once completed, the Haseotes family will concentrate on expanding the Cumberland Farms convenience store brand.
This deal represents ArcLight's first venture into the branded fuels business, as it will pick up a network of more than 2,500 sites in 30 states. According to OPIS, Gulf also owns a transportation fleet of nearly 200 trucks and a network of unbranded fuel sales via proprietary and third-party terminals.

When contacted by CSNews Online, Gulf Oil said it does not comment on the company’s ongoing strategic and operating matters, and particularly "not on rumors and/or speculative matters."
ArcLight has invested more than $13 billion in 90 transactions since it was founded in 2001. The private equity firm did not return a phone call seeking comment.
Convenience store assets have been in high demand recently due to rising profits thanks to high-margin foodservice offerings and lower gas prices. In 2014 and thus far in 2015, several high-profile convenience store and fuel mergers and acquisitions have taken place.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
