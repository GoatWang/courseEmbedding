Ask a question about this product



Protect your equipment!  Blood and body fluids often contaminate the CT gantry during interventional procedures. Not only is this a biohazard, but improper cleaning could lead to image artifacts or other equipment problems. 

We have designed a cost effective bore drape to help protect your CT scanner.  The Gantry Drape measures 72” x  72” and includes (6) strips of low-tack adhesive along 2 sides. The adhesive strips will hold the drape securely in place during each procedure but not leave any sticky residue on your scanner.  The plastic is a 1mil, high density material that is durable but will not block laser positioning lines. Priced per package of (20) drapes. Non-sterile.  
 
Easy and quick installation by one person or two. Simply unfold the drape, peel off the paper backing on adhesive strips, and place inside the CT gantry as required.

Med-X, Inc. Publishes Results from 2015-2017 Integrated Pest Management Study

By Nick Phillips -   Apr 11, 2017 414934 2

Med-X, Inc., a Los Angeles based ancillary products company, recently published the results from its first research and development study. The report focuses on its Nature-Cide pesticide products and their uses in a proprietary integrated pest management (IPM) strategy for the cultivation of cannabis. The report documents one of the company’s research cultivations that took place between August 1st, 2015 to March 15th, 2017. The objective of the study was to cultivate high-grade medicinal marijuana without the use of chemical pesticides. The report indicates that they were successful in cultivating four strains from clone to curing without the use of any sort of chemical pesticides. The final product from the harvest was tested by SC Labs in March of 2017 and those results are also included in the report findings. The full report can be found here.
“We have the proprietary products and required certified expertise to practice pest management on agriculture in the state of California. When cultivators from other legal states started using our products in the cannabis industry, it was important for us to dive right in and prove internally that, indeed, our products and methods get the job done,” said Matthew Mills, COO of Med-X, Inc.
During the process of documenting the research grow, the team was also able to create a simple IPM guide that walks a grower through the process of using the Nature-Cide products while cultivating. The report was published at a time when many Los Angeles based dispensaries were called into question after an NBC 4 report came out documenting a 95% rate of pesticides in tested products from over 25 local Los Angeles dispensaries. 
“As much as people want to deny it, growing world class cannabis without using chemical pesticides is possible and we set out to prove it. This report proves to our community that with the right strategy, any size operation can produce amazing results with confidence,” said Mills.
As state and city regulations are being finalized in California, growers across the state are being forced to get their operations compliant – sooner rather than later.
“Public health officials at the Los Angeles County level are very aware of the level of contamination in some of the medicinal product that is being sold. Our sources at the county level have indicated to us that progress is being made on how the rules and regulations will shape out and the number one focus will be geared toward public health and safety,” explained Mills.
As a consultant for the Los Angeles County Fire Department, Mills and his team have been hard at work, pointing out the corners previous black market growers have cut over the years in hopes that the leadership at the county level will be patient as cultivators get on the same page. Mr. Mills and his team are hoping that all the commercial and private cultivators in the county will take the initiative to educate themselves on the building codes and requirements that all grow facilities will have to abide by in the near future.
“In this ever-changing, fast-paced industry of cannabis, it is important to understand that our officials and the community have to work hand-in-hand to ensure the safety and well-being of our citizens, patients and customers. We look forward to the day when together, we can all look back and see how far we have come.”

Med-X, Inc. Launches Cannabis Industry's First Regulation A+ Equity Crowdfunding Campaign

		  Company's Products to Professionalize the Cannabis Industry by Keeping Medical-Grade, Unregulated Cannabis Safe from Pesticides, Mold and Other Harmful Substances
		

Dec 16, 2015, 04:20 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Med-X, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


LOS ANGELES, Dec. 16, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Med-X, Inc. (Med-X) today launched an equity crowdfunding initiative as the next phase in the company's fundraising strategy. The company announced late last month that it had been qualified by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to sell shares to the general public through the Regulation A+ equity crowdfunding initiative, making Med-X the first company in the cannabis industry to be qualified by the SEC for a public offering under these rules. The company will be offering anyone interested in embracing the rapidly emerging cannabis industry, expected to yield billions annually, the chance to reserve shares early. 
Blazing the trail with research and development, agriculture, manufacturing and a media division, Med-X's mission is to expand the medical and recreational cannabis industry by educating the community and developing products that are safe, effective and affordable. The company's relationships in the medical and biochemistry fields give it the ability to position itself as a long-term player in the industry. 
"We are offering this chance to reserve shares through an equity crowdfunding campaign to give all Americans the chance to be a part of a positive phase in the rapidly evolving cannabis industry," said Dr. David Toomey, CEO of Med-X. "We see tremendous growth potential for the industry at large with both medical and recreational users, as well as a tremendous need for products that the public can trust not to be contaminated with pesticides, mold, or other problematic substances." 
In February 2015, Med-X opened its first patient cooperative to cultivate 100% natural and organically grown medical cannabis for its research and development program. Med-X's management team recognized a huge need to bring safe, medical-grade cannabis to the medical community that is free of pesticides, mold and other harmful substances. Medical cannabis dispensaries in California remain unregulated for the most part, despite cannabis' use as a holistic alternative to pharmaceutical drugs. As more states legalize medical and recreational cannabis, cultivation centers are likely to face mandated product testing for potency and contaminants and, as a result, many will subsequently be forced to close if they aren't complying. 
Med-X's Nature-Cide product was created to solve the pesticide problem with all natural green solutions and is one of the first to market. Nature-Cide All Purpose Insecticide has been tested safe for cannabis cultivation, is EPA Registered nationally with the states which require registration and has been approved by the Colorado Department of Agriculture for use in cannabis cultivation. 
Individuals interested in learning more about the opportunity to reserve shares in Med-X can visit StartEngine.com. Med-X will be one of the first ten companies utilizing StartEngine.com.

Med-X, Inc. Aiming to Correct the Course of Cannabis in America with New Insecticidal Soil
Press Release

By Nick Phillips -   Jan 8, 2016 8434 0

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — As of late, despite its nagging presence on the Federal Schedule I Substance list, cannabis reform has been sweeping the country. Thirty-nine of 50 states have some sort of cannabis law on the books to legalize the medical side, and four states: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington as well as the District of Columbia, have completely adopted its legalization. As those remaining states begin to see the massive tax benefits legalization brings, and the medical uses of cannabis are better understood, it won’t be long until cannabis is rescheduled or outright legalized federally.
The medical cannabis industry remains one of the least understood and least developed markets out there, mostly because of its questionable legality. This issue of legality not only touches the sale, cultivation, and transportation of cannabis, but also every part of the medical cannabis industry chain. The hurdles surrounding cannabis affect research and development, distribution of product, cultivation equipment production, and even what kind of information about cannabis is accessible to the public.
Clearly, this difference in legality, state by state, causes havoc at every level of the medical cannabis industry. But despite its current limitations, medical cannabis is still a multi-billion dollar industry. There’s no denying that Americans want their cannabis and are willing to support the market even through all of these hurdles.
But what happens after cannabis has been legalized? When the federal government does finally take the step to legalize cannabis, there will be a void created as states scramble to handle the quickly budding market. At Med-X, Inc. their management believes the first step needs to be better oversight and regulation, while focusing within the greater industry.
Med-X has already taken steps to handle post-legalization America, and they’re doing it by creating a company that can handle every aspect of the medical cannabis industry. Whether it’s cultivation, research and development, or information, Med-X is building a business for the future of cannabis.
One of the ways the management at Med-X is accomplishing this is through a total overhaul of what people consider a cannabis company to be. Mostly, when people think of the cannabis industry, they see farmers in the mountains of California protecting their crops with guns, or the lonely drug dealers that haunt apartment complexes slinging something from Mexico; there’s a real disconnect between what the cannabis industry was and what it will be. By tackling the cannabis industry from a centralized standpoint, we can control each link in the cannabis supply chain, positively altering the entire industry.
For example, take their first flagship product, Nature-Cide All-Purpose Insecticide. Developed as a completely non-toxic insecticide alternative developed for the cultivation of cannabis, the formula is safe to use from sprout to harvest, indoor or outdoor. They developed it to be 100% safe and the only pesticide a cannabis cultivator will need. By producing a product that is effective and safe as well as cost-effective, we strongly encourage the industry to choose our formula and produce better, healthier plant life. However, we don’t just stop there.
Med-X is also engulfed in research and development of the cannabis industry just as much as it’s in the cannabis information industry, and that means we keep innovating to improve on each link in the cannabis chain. This is why after multiple cultivation tests, in Q3 of this year, “we are releasing a new all natural insecticidal soil, our special proprietary blend refined through research. The soil protects the roots of the plant from pests while producing the kinds of crop yields cultivators hope for and expect,” states co-founder and COO Matthew Mills.
“Both the insecticidal soil and the Nature-Cide All Purpose Insecticide are safe to use with any kind of cultivation project, but they were developed specifically to satisfy each step of cannabis cultivation. By providing exceptional products that have been proven safe and natural, we can ensure cannabis gets grown to our particular standards and expectations for excellence,” states Mills.
The final, and perhaps most important, step that they have taken with Med-X is to open the company to the consumers. Medical cannabis is foremost a medicine, and they are developing this company to be consumer facing from day one. “The biggest and best way we can show our commitment to the people who need medical cannabis is through our current equity crowdfunding initiative on StartEngine,” states CEO Dr. David Toomey.
“As soon as the SEC released its final ruling on equity crowdfunding regulations set forth in the JOBS Act, we knew that it would be a great opportunity to involve and support our consumers. Equity crowdfunding through StartEngine allows us to build knowledge of our company and our initiative, raise capital to serve our consumers, and offer exciting, potentially life-changing investments to our biggest supporters. Though we have only been campaigning for a short period of time, we’ve already received in excess of $1 Million in indicated interest to invest from over 600 individuals. While this is certainly exciting news on the capital front, we feel it’s most important because it shows a real connection has been established with our consumers,” states Dr. Toomey.
That connection, whether it was made through products, the crowdfunding campaign, the information they distribute through The Marijuana Times, or through their commitment to satisfying patients, is the most important benchmark of success for this team of professionals. “These connections, and the support they bring, show us that we are moving in the right direction with Med-X, and give us hope for our and the industry’s future. With your support we can continue to shape a better future for medical cannabis, its cultivators, and its consumers,” states Dr. Toomey.

Med-X, Inc. Signs Deal with GrowMinded to Supply Nature-Cide to Cannabis Cultivators in Multiple States
Apr 4 16
Med-X, Inc. has struck a deal with cultivation distribution venue GrowMinded to supply Nature-Cide to cannabis cultivators in multiple states. Test results from farms and gardens across the state of California from the Bay area, Emerald Triangle and Southern California are continually coming in. Nature-Cide's All Purpose product is on the approved list of pesticides for use on cannabis by the Colorado Department of Agriculture and on the recommended list in Washington State and Oregon. States where recreational use of cannabis is legal are paving the way on how all regulations and oversight will progress as the plant moves more mainstream. Just like any other crop, drug or consumer product, producers will not have a choice but grow responsibly and produce medicine or products that are not laced with dangerous chemicals. Nature-Cide is positioning itself to be the leader and is offering growers a solution that is proven to work and eliminate the fear and anxiety that comes from managing pests and the regulators.

Med-X, Inc. Aiming to Correct the Course of Cannabis in America with New Insecticidal Soil

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- As of late, despite its nagging presence on the Federal Schedule I Substance list, cannabis reform has been sweeping the country. Thirty-nine of 50 states have some sort of cannabis law on the books to legalize the medical side, and four states: Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington as well as the District of Columbia, have completely adopted its legalization. As those remaining states begin to see the massive tax benefits legalization brings, and the medical uses of cannabis are better understood, it won't be long until cannabis is rescheduled or outright legalized federally.
The medical cannabis industry remains one of the least understood and least developed markets out there, mostly because of its questionable legality. This issue of legality not only touches the sale, cultivation, and transportation of cannabis, but also every part of the medical cannabis industry chain. The hurdles surrounding cannabis affect research and development, distribution of product, cultivation equipment production, and even what kind of information about cannabis is accessible to the public.
Clearly, this difference in legality, state by state, causes havoc at every level of the medical cannabis industry. But despite its current limitations, medical cannabis is still a multi-billion dollar industry. There's no denying that Americans want their cannabis and are willing to support the market even through all of these hurdles.
But what happens after cannabis has been legalized? When the federal government does finally take the step to legalize cannabis, there will be a void created as states scramble to handle the quickly budding market. At Med-X, Inc. their management believes the first step needs to be better oversight and regulation, while focusing within the greater industry.
Med-X has already taken steps to handle post-legalization America, and they're  doing it by creating a company that can handle every aspect of the medical cannabis industry. Whether it's cultivation, research and development, or information, Med-X is building a business for the future of cannabis.
One of the ways the management at Med-X is accomplishing this is through a total overhaul of what people consider a cannabis company to be. Mostly, when people think of the cannabis industry, they see farmers in the mountains of California protecting their crops with guns, or the lonely drug dealers that haunt apartment complexes slinging something from Mexico; there's a real disconnect between what the cannabis industry was and what it will be. By tackling the cannabis industry from a centralized standpoint, we can control each link in the cannabis supply chain, positively altering the entire industry.
For example, take their  first flagship product, Nature-Cide All-Purpose Insecticide. Developed as a completely non-toxic insecticide alternative developed for the cultivation of cannabis, the formula is safe to use from sprout to harvest, indoor or outdoor. They developed it to be 100% safe and the only pesticide a cannabis cultivator will need. By producing a product that is effective and safe as well as cost-effective, we strongly encourage the industry to choose our formula and produce better, healthier plant life. However, we don't just stop there.
Med-X is also engulfed in research and development of the cannabis industry just as much as it's in the cannabis information industry, and that means we keep innovating to improve on each link in the cannabis chain. This is why after multiple cultivation tests, in Q3 of this year, "we are releasing a new all natural insecticidal soil, our special proprietary blend refined through research. The soil protects the roots of the plant from pests while producing the kinds of crop yields cultivators hope for and expect," states co-founder and COO Matthew Mills.
"Both the insecticidal soil and the Nature-Cide All Purpose Insecticide are safe to use with any kind of cultivation project, but they were developed specifically to satisfy each step of cannabis cultivation. By providing exceptional products that have been proven safe and natural, we can ensure cannabis gets grown to our particular standards and expectations for excellence," states Mills. 
The final, and perhaps most important, step that they have taken with Med-X is to open the company to the consumers. Medical cannabis is foremost a medicine, and they are developing this company to be consumer facing from day one. "The biggest and best way we can show our commitment to the people who need medical cannabis is through our current equity crowdfunding initiative on StartEngine," states CEO Dr. David Toomey.
"As soon as the SEC released its final ruling on equity crowdfunding regulations set forth in the JOBS Act, we knew that it would be a great opportunity to involve and support our consumers. Equity crowdfunding through StartEngine allows us to build knowledge of our company and our initiative, raise capital to serve our consumers, and offer exciting, potentially life-changing investments to our biggest supporters. Though we have only been campaigning for a short period of time, we've already received in excess of $1 Million in indicated interest to invest from over 600 individuals. While this is certainly exciting news on the capital front, we feel it's most important because it shows a real connection has been established with our consumers," states Dr. Toomey. 
That connection, whether it was made through products, the crowdfunding campaign, the information they distribute through The Marijuana Times, or through their commitment to satisfying patients, is the most important benchmark of success for this team of professionals. "These connections, and the support they bring, show us that we are moving in the right direction with Med-X, and give us hope for our and the industry's future. With your support we can continue to shape a better future for medical cannabis, its cultivators, and its consumers," states Dr. Toomey.

The two pair of Jobst Opaque open toe knee highs arrived today. What  
a pleasure dealing with your company.
someone on the phone promised that the stockings would arrive within  
the week-and today they arrived.

We had been dealing with (another company) for over two and a half months-- 
charged for an order which never
arrived. Thank goodness my husband found your company on the web. We  
now will always order from you.

I placed an order today with Rondi. I can not believe the prices! Rondi's customer service was superb! She was extremely knowledgeable, helpful and personable.
 I am only sorry that I was unaware of "For Your Legs.com" prior to purchasing my Jobst support pantyhose locally in St. Louis at a price $50 higher than on your web site!

Thanks for the outstanding service and making me feel so very comfortable with placing my order!
