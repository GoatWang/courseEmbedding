            Fabric flowers are an indispensable and beautiful decoration for most events. Weddings, celebrations, holidays are often decorated with such flowers. The flowers are mostly used for personal adornment and creating bouquets. Artificial flowers made of fabric can be used many times without harm to the nature and look as new. This is a very beautiful and diverse decoration for people and for interior. For the ultimate in quality and beauty, we will use colorful silk, paints and special equipment and some additional components. 

Because of this, the flowers cannot be environmentally unfriendly to humans.We use silk as a primarily fabric. Silk gives flowers the opportunity to be beautiful and look like real. In addition, we need the wires to create a flower stem and also we need special stamens. We do not use synthetic and harmful dyes.

Our main competitor in this industry is Prima company and FloristaVenezia. We 
will start to compete with them in the quality of our product and the individual
approach to each client.

Ferd will give the originality and beauty for our products that will release us
from the crowd.


Company Description
Our company was incorporated on July 1, 2016 in the State of Nevada. We are a 
development-stage company formed to produce artificial flowers made of fabric.
 
We have developed twelve months’ business plan, purchased and set up our first
flower making tools, and signed a lease agreement for a


 1-year dated October 15,
2016. To this date, we have purchased equipment, tested its operation, and
produced a range of demonstration samples to attract new potential customers and
signed a sales contract with Venice Event Group. Our director Leonid Skupchenko
is in charge of our production process.

Fabric flowers are an indispensable and beautiful decoration for most events.
Weddings, celebrations, holidays are often decorated with such flowers. The
flowers are mostly used for personal adornment and creating bouquets. Artificial
flowers made of fabric can be used many times without harm to the nature and
look as new. This is a very beautiful and diverse decoration for people and for
interior. For the ultimate in quality and beauty, we will use colorful silk,
paints and special equipment and some additional components.

Ferd can supply our fabric flowers decorations to any celebratory event by
collaborating with event agencies. We can work with private clients by providing
individual orders in retail and with corporate clients, such as flower shops and
event agencies, in wholesale distribution. Ferd plans to provide its products to
flower and wedding festivals and exhibitions to reach out our potential clients
there as well.

Ferd is currently in verbal negotiations with two potential customers Venice
First Srl and Brilliant Wedding Venice event agencies. Once we attract
sufficient number of customers, we plan to expand our business to large
production volumes to be able to decorate a huge events and celebrations.

Our main competitor in this industry is Prima company and FloristaVenezia. We

Company Description
Our company was incorporated on July 1, 2016 in the State of Nevada. We are a 
development-stage company formed to produce artificial flowers made of fabric.
 
We have developed twelve months’ business plan, purchased and set up our first
flower making tools, and signed a lease agreement for a


 1-year dated October 15,
2016. To this date, we have purchased equipment, tested its operation, and
produced a range of demonstration samples to attract new potential customers and
signed a sales contract with Venice Event Group. Our director Leonid Skupchenko
is in charge of our production process.

Fabric flowers are an indispensable and beautiful decoration for most events.
Weddings, celebrations, holidays are often decorated with such flowers. The
flowers are mostly used for personal adornment and creating bouquets. Artificial
flowers made of fabric can be used many times without harm to the nature and
look as new. This is a very beautiful and diverse decoration for people and for
interior. For the ultimate in quality and beauty, we will use colorful silk,
paints and special equipment and some additional components.

Ferd can supply our fabric flowers decorations to any celebratory event by
collaborating with event agencies. We can work with private clients by providing
individual orders in retail and with corporate clients, such as flower shops and
event agencies, in wholesale distribution. Ferd plans to provide its products to
flower and wedding festivals and exhibitions to reach out our potential clients
there as well.

Ferd is currently in verbal negotiations with two potential customers Venice
First Srl and Brilliant Wedding Venice event agencies. Once we attract
sufficient number of customers, we plan to expand our business to large
production volumes to be able to decorate a huge events and celebrations.
