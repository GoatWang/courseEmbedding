No one guessed he would change the world. A simple country farm boy once prayed that God would use him…and prayed…and prayed. And God did use him, beyond what he ever imagined. He grew into a man who would lead millions of people to Christ, a man who would be known as the greatest evangelist of our time. Come read the story of Billy Graham and follow his life from his days as a boy, who wasn’t so great in school, to a man who would teach the world the greatest lesson of all: how to know and live for Christ.
