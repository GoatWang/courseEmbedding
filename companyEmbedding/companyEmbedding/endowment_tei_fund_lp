is limited to the value of the investment in such Investment Funds as reported  
by the Fund. In addition, the Fund may from time to time invest directly in     
derivative securities or other financial instruments to gain greater or lesser  
exposure to a particular asset class.                                           

2. VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS                                           

The valuation of the Fund's investments is determined as of the close of        
business at the end of any fiscal period, generally monthly. The valuation of   
the Fund's investments is generally calculated by BISYS Fund Services Ohio, Inc.
("BISYS"), the Fund's independent administrator (the "Independent               
Administrator") in consultation with Endowment Advisers, L.P., the adviser to   
the Fund (the "Adviser"). The valuation procedures of the Fund's underlying     
investments are reviewed by a committee approved by the Fund's board of         
directors (the "Board") that was established to oversee the valuation of the    
Fund's investments (the "Valuation Committee"), in consultation with the Adviser
and the Independent Administrator. The net assets of the Fund will equal the    
value of the total assets of the Fund, less all of its liabilities, including   
accrued fees and expenses.                                                      

Investments held by the Fund are valued as follows:                             

-    INVESTMENT FUNDS - Investments in Investment Funds are ordinarily valued at
    the valuations provided to the Independent Administrator by the investment
     managers of such Investment Funds or the administrators of those Investment
    Funds. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are subject to the terms
and conditions of the respective operating agreements and offering    
   memoranda, as appropriate. The Fund's investments in Investment Funds are
carried at estimated fair value as determined by the Fund's pro-rata  
     interest in the net assets of each Investment Fund. Because of the inherent
 uncertainty of valuation, this estimated fair value may differ from the
   value that would have been used had a ready market for the investments in
 Investment Funds existed. These Investment Funds value their underlying
investments in accordance with policies established by such Investment
Funds. All valuations utilize financial information supplied by each  
Investment Fund and are net of management and estimated performance   
 incentive fees or allocations payable to the Investment Funds' managers
pursuant to the Investment Funds' agreements.                         

P-->N-Q11th�Page�of�12TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�11th
-    SECURITIES LISTED ON A SECURITIES EXCHANGE - Securities listed on one or   
 more of the national securities exchanges or the OTC Bulletin Board are
  valued at the last reported sales price on the date of determination and
securities listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market are valued at the Nasdaq 
    Official Closing Price ("NOCP"), on the date of determination. If the last
reported sales price or the NOCP is not available, the securities are 
valued at the mean between the "bid" and "ask" prices at the close of 
  trading on that date. Securities traded on a foreign securities exchange
     will generally be valued at their closing prices on the exchange where such
 securities are primarily traded and translated into U.S. dollars at the
    current exchange rate. If an event occurs between the close of the foreign
exchange and the computation of the Fund's net asset value that would 
   materially affect the value of the security, the value of such a security
will be adjusted to its fair value.                                   

-    OPTIONS - Options that are listed on a securities exchange or traded       
over-the-counter are valued at the mean between the closing "bid" and 
"ask" prices for such options on the date of determination.           

   SECURITIES NOT ACTIVELY TRADED - The value of securities, derivatives, or
   synthetic securities that are not actively traded on an exchange shall be
   determined by obtaining indicative quotes from brokers that normally deal
in such securities or by an unaffiliated pricing service that may use 
actual trade data or procedures using market indices, matrices, yield 
   curves, specific trading characteristics of certain groups of securities,
pricing models, or a combination of these procedures.                 

-    OTHER - Where no value is readily available from an Investment Fund or     
  other security or where a value supplied by an Investment Fund is deemed
 not to be indicative of the Investment Fund's fair value, the Valuation
Committee and/or the Board, in consultation with the Independent      
   Administrator or the Adviser will determine, in good faith, the estimated
fair value of the Investment Fund or security.                        

3. INVESTMENT SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS                                 

The Fund records security transactions on a trade-date basis.                   

Securities that are held by the Fund, including those that have been sold but   
not yet purchased, are marked to estimated fair value at the date of the        
financial statements, and the corresponding unrealized gain or loss is included 
in the statement of operations.                                                 

Realized gains or losses on the disposition of investments are accounted for    
based on the first in first out ("FIFO") method.                                

Distributions received from investments, whether in the form of cash or         
securities, are generally applied as a reduction of the cost of the investment.

Item�1. Summary Term Sheet.  As disclosed in the Private Placement Memorandum of The Endowment TEI Fund, L.P. (the �Fund� or the �TEI Fund�) as amended on July�2, 2007, and may be amended from time to time (the
�PPM�), it is anticipated that on a quarterly basis, subject to Board approval, the Fund will offer to buy your limited partnership interests (�Interests�) or a portion thereof, at their estimated net asset value (which is
calculated as the estimated value of the Fund�s assets minus its liabilities). This offer will remain open until midnight on February�29, 2008. Estimated net asset value will be calculated for this purpose on March�31, 2008 (also
referred to herein as the �Valuation Date�). Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the PPM.  Following this summary is a formal notice of the Fund�s offer to purchase all or a portion of your Interests. This offer remains open to you until midnight on February�29, 2008. Until this time, you have the
right to change your mind and withdraw your Interests from consideration for purchase. If we do not accept your interests by midnight, February�29, 2008 (also referred to herein as the �Expiration Date�), you may still withdraw your
Interests at any time after February�29, 2008, assuming your tender has not been accepted.  If an investor would like the Fund to
purchase his or her Interests, the investor generally should mail a Letter of Transmittal (the Tender Offer Form will suffice), which is attached to this document as Exhibit 99.3, to Endowment Advisers, L.P. (the �Investment Adviser�) at
4265 San Felipe, 8th Floor, Houston, Texas, 77027, or fax it to the Investment Adviser at (713)�583-1330, Attention: TEF Fund Operations, so that it is received before midnight, Central time, February�29, 2008. If he or she chooses to fax
the Letter of Transmittal, he or she should mail the original Tender Offer Form to the Investment Adviser promptly after faxing it (although the original page does not have to be received before midnight, February�29, 2008). Investors whose
broker of record is a Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner�& Smith, Inc. (�Merrill�) financial adviser should mail or fax the Letter of Transmittal (the Tender Offer Form will suffice) to their financial adviser, instead of to the
Investment Adviser, by the deadline set forth above (i.e. before midnight, Central time, February�29, 2008).  The value of your
limited partnership interests (�Interests�) is likely to change between November�30, 2007 (the last time estimated net asset value was calculated) and March�31, 2008, when the value of your investment will be determined for
purposes of calculating your purchase price. If you would like to obtain the estimated net asset value of your Interests, which the Fund�s administrator calculates monthly based on the information the Fund receives from the managers of the
investment funds in which the Fund invests, you may contact the Support Desk of the Investment Adviser at (800)�725-9456, Monday through Friday, except holidays, during normal business hours of 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Central Time. 
Please note that just as you have the opportunity to have your Interests repurchased in the Offer, the Fund has the right to cancel, amend or postpone
this offer at any time before midnight, February�29, 2008. Also realize that although the tender offer expires on February�29, 2008, you remain a partner in the Fund until March�31, 2008, when the estimated net asset value of your
Interests is calculated.  Item�2. Issuer Information.  (a) The name of the issuer is The Endowment TEI Fund, L.P. The Fund is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the �1940 Act�), as a closed-end, non-diversified, management
investment company and is organized as a Delaware limited partnership. The principal executive office of the Fund is located at 4265 San Felipe, 8th Floor, Houston, Texas 77027 and the telephone number is (713)�993-4675.  (b) The title of the securities that are the subject of the offer to purchase (�Offer to Purchase� and the tender offer made thereby, the
�Offer�) is limited partnership interests or portions thereof in the Fund. (As used herein, the term �Interest� or �Interests,� as the context requires, shall refer to the limited partnership interests in the Fund and
portions thereof that constitute the class of security that is the subject of this Offer to Purchase or the limited partnership interests in the Fund or portions thereof that are tendered by investors to the Fund pursuant to 
 �
1 



the Offer to Purchase.) As of the close of business on November�30, 2007, there was approximately $876,432,507 outstanding in capital of the Fund held
in Interests. Subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Fund will purchase up to $99,000,000 of Interests (subject to reduction, as set forth below) that are tendered by and not withdrawn prior to 12:00 midnight, Central
time, on February�29, 2008, subject to any extension of the Offer to Purchase.  The Fund is one of several �feeder� funds
that invests all of its capital into The Endowment Master Fund, L.P. (the �Master Fund�), which then invests its capital in Investment Funds. The Board of the Master Fund has approved a tender offer for up to $326,000,000 of capital of its
investors, including the Fund and the other �feeder funds�. The Board of the TEI Fund has approved a tender offer of up to $99,000,000, subject to reduction as set forth below.  The Master Fund has approximately $2,910,303,040 in net asset value as of November�30, 2007, with the Fund comprising approximately $876,432,507 (or
approximately 30.1%) of such amount. Assuming that all of the other �feeder� funds in the Master Fund (including the TEI Fund) tendered interests in excess of their ratable portion of the $326,000,000 tender offer being made by the Master
Fund, then each �feeder� fund, including the Fund, would have the amount available for repurchase reduced proportionately.  Since
the TEI Fund comprises approximately 30.1% of the capital of the Master Fund, the Partners in the Fund would only be permitted to have approximately $98,126,000 of their interests repurchased (calculated as 30.1% of the total $326,000,000 repurchase
offer being made by the Master Fund) if it was ratably reduced. Thus, the maximum amount of this tender offer shall be between $99,000,000 and $98,126,000 (such amount being referred to herein as the �Maximum Amount�)  (c) Interests are not traded in any market, and any transfer thereof is strictly limited by the terms of the Fund�s Limited Partnership Agreement
dated as of March�17, 2005 (the �LP Agreement�).  Item�3. Identity and Background of Filing Person.  (a) The name of the filing person is The Endowment TEI Fund, L.P. The Fund�s principal executive office is located at 4265 San Felipe, 8th Floor,
Houston, Texas 77027 and the telephone number is (713)�993-4675. The investment adviser of the Fund is Endowment Advisers, L.P. The principal executive office of the Investment Adviser is located at 4265 San Felipe, 8th Floor, Houston, Texas
77027 and the telephone number is (713)�993-4675. The Investment Adviser�s Investment Committee and Managing Directors are Messrs. John A. Blaisdell, Andrew B. Linbeck, A. Haag Sherman and Mark W. Yusko (herein defined as the
�Managers�). Their address is c/o Endowment Advisers, L.P. at 4265 San Felipe, 8th Floor, Houston, Texas 77027.  Item�4. Terms of This
Tender Offer.  (a) (1)�(i)�Subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the Fund will purchase up to
$99,000,000 of Interests that are tendered by and not withdrawn prior to 12:00 midnight, Central Standard Time, on February�29, 2008, subject to any extension of the Offer to Purchase (the �Expiration Date�).  (ii) The purchase price of Interests tendered to the Fund will be their estimated net asset value as of the close of business on
March�31, 2008, if the Offer to Purchase expires on the expected expiration date of February�29, 2008.  �


�
�
�
 The initial payment (the �Initial Payment�) will be made in an amount equal to at least 95% of the estimated value of the repurchased Interest (or portion
thereof), determined as of the Valuation Date. The Initial Payment will be made as of the later of (1)�the 30th day after the Valuation Date, or (2)�in the sole discretion of the Adviser, if the Master Fund has requested withdrawals of its
capital from any Investment Funds in order to fund the repurchase of Interests, within ten business days after the Fund has received at least 95% of the aggregate amount so requested to be withdrawn by the Master Fund from the Investment Funds (the
�Investment Fund Payment Date�).  �
2 




�
�
�
 The second and final payment (the �Final Payment�) is expected to be in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1)�the value of the repurchased
Interest (or portion thereof), determined as of the Valuation Date based upon the results of the annual audit of the Fund�s financial statements for the fiscal year in which the Valuation Date of such repurchase occurred, over (2)�the
Initial Payment. The Adviser anticipates that the annual audit of the Fund�s financial statements will be completed within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Fund and that the Final Payment will be made as promptly as practicable
after the completion of such audit.  �


�
�
�
 Although the amounts required to be paid by the Fund will generally be paid in cash, the Fund may under certain limited circumstances pay all or a portion of the
amounts due by an in-kind distribution of securities.  �


�
�
�
 Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in the event that a Partner has requested the repurchase of a portion of its Interest which would result
in such Partner continuing to hold at least 10% of the value of its Interest as of March�31 of the fiscal year ending immediately prior to the fiscal year in which such request was made, the Final Payment in respect of such repurchase shall be
made on or before the 60th day after the Valuation Date, provided that if the Master Fund, in the sole discretion of the Adviser, has requested withdrawals of its capital from any Investment Funds in order to fund the repurchase of Interests, such
payment may be postponed until 10 business days after the applicable Investment Fund Payment Date. Such payment shall be in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (1)�the value of the repurchased Interest (or portion thereof), determined as
of the Valuation Date, based upon information known to the Fund as of the date of the Final Payment, over (2)�the Initial Payment. If, based upon the results of the annual audit of the Fund�s financial statements for the fiscal year in
which the Valuation Date of such repurchase occurred, it is determined that the value at which the Interest was repurchased was incorrect, the Fund shall, as promptly as practicable after the completion of such audit, decrease such Partner�s
capital account balance by the amount of any overpayment, or increase such Partner�s capital account balance by the amount of any underpayment, as applicable.  The repurchase of Interests is subject to regulatory requirements imposed by the SEC. The Fund�s repurchase procedures are intended to comply with
such requirements. However, in the event that the Board determines that modification of the repurchase procedures described above is required or appropriate, the Board will adopt revised repurchase procedures as necessary to ensure the Fund�s
compliance with applicable regulations or as the Board in its sole discretion deems appropriate. Following the commencement of an offer to repurchase Interests, the Fund may suspend, postpone or terminate such offer in certain circumstances upon the
determination of a majority of the Board, including a majority of the Independent Directors, that such suspension, postponement or termination is advisable for the Fund and its Partners, including, without limitation, circumstances as a result of
which it is not reasonably practicable for the Fund to dispose of its investments or to determine the value of its net assets, and other unusual circumstances.  Each Partner whose Interest (or portion thereof) has been accepted for repurchase will continue to be a Partner of the Fund until the Valuation Date (and thereafter if its Interest is repurchased in part) and may
exercise its voting rights with respect to the repurchased Interest (or portion thereof) until the Valuation Date. Moreover, the capital account maintained in respect of a Partner whose Interest (or portion thereof) has been accepted for repurchase
will be adjusted for the net profits or net losses of the Fund through the Valuation Date, and such Partner�s capital account shall not be adjusted for the amount withdrawn, as a result of the repurchase, prior to the Valuation Date.
 Upon its acceptance of tendered Interests or portions of Interests for repurchase, the Fund will maintain daily on its books a segregated
account consisting of (1)�cash, (2)�liquid securities or (3)�interests in Investment Funds that the Fund has requested be withdrawn (or any combination of them), in an amount equal to the aggregate estimated unpaid dollar amount of
the promissory notes issued to Partners tendering Interests and portions of Interests.  �
3 


Payments for repurchased Interests may require the Fund to liquidate portfolio holdings in Investment
Funds earlier than the Adviser otherwise would liquidate such holdings, potentially resulting in losses, a reduction in the Fund�s tax efficiency and may increase the Fund�s portfolio turnover. The Adviser intends to take measures to
attempt to avoid or minimize such potential losses and turnover. The Fund may, but need not, maintain cash or borrow money to meet repurchase requests. Such a practice could increase the Fund�s operating expenses and impact the ability of the
Fund to achieve its investment objective.  A 2% Early Repurchase Fee will be charged by the Fund (and inure to the benefit of the
remaining Partners) with respect to any repurchase of an Interest (or portion thereof) from a Partner at any time prior to the business day immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of the Partner�s purchase of such Interest (or portion
thereof). Partial Interests tendered for repurchase will be treated as having been repurchased on a �first in�first out� basis. Therefore, the portion of an Interest repurchased will be deemed to have been taken from the earliest
capital contribution made by such Partner (adjusted for subsequent net profits and net losses) until that capital contribution is decreased to zero, and then from each subsequent capital contribution made by such Partner (adjusted for subsequent net
profits and net losses) until such capital contribution is decreased to zero.  Other than the Early Repurchase Fee, the Fund does not
presently intend to impose any charges (except for direct costs and expenses, such as wiring fees) on the repurchase of Interests, although it may allocate to Partners whose Interests are repurchased withdrawal or similar charges imposed by
Investment Funds if the Adviser determines to withdraw from one or more Investment Funds as a result of Partner repurchase tenders and such charges are imposed on the Fund.  A Partner who tenders some but not all of the Partner�s Interest for repurchase will be required to maintain a minimum capital account balance of
$100,000. Such minimum capital account balance requirement may be waived by the Fund, in its sole discretion. The Fund reserves the right to reduce the amount to be repurchased from a Partner so that the required capital account balance is
maintained.  In the event that the Adviser or any of its affiliates holds an Interest (or portion of an Interest) in its capacity as a
Partner, such Interest (or portion of an Interest) may be tendered for repurchase in connection with any repurchase offer made by the Fund, without notice to the other Partners.  A copy of: (i)�the Cover Letter to the Offer to Purchase and Letter of Transmittal; (ii)�the Offer to Purchase; and (iii)�a form of Letter
of Transmittal are attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, and 99.3, respectively.  (iii) The scheduled expiration date is
12:00 midnight, Central Standard Time, February�29, 2008.  (iv) Not applicable.  (v) The Fund reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, to extend the period of time during which the Offer is pending by
notifying investors of such extension. If the Fund elects to extend the Offer to Purchase, the estimated net asset value of such Interests will be determined approximately one month after the Offer to Purchase actually expires. During any such
extension, all Interests previously tendered and not withdrawn will remain subject to the Offer. The Fund also reserves the right, at any time and from time to time, up to and including acceptance of tenders pursuant to the Offer, to:
(a)�cancel the Offer and in the event of such cancellation, not to purchase or pay for any Interests tendered pursuant to the Offer; (b)�amend the Offer; or (c)�postpone the acceptance of tendered Interests. If the Fund determines to
amend the Offer or to postpone the acceptance of Interests tendered, it will, to the extent necessary, extend the period of time during which the Offer is open as provided above and will promptly notify investors.  (vi) Interests may be withdrawn at any time before 12:00 midnight, Central Standard Time, February�29, 2008 and, if tendered
Interests have not then been accepted by the Fund, at any time after February�29, 2008.  �

(vii) Investors wishing to tender Interests pursuant to the Offer should generally send
or deliver a completed and executed Letter of Transmittal (the Tender Offer Form will suffice) to the Investment Adviser, to the attention of TEF Fund Operations, at the address set forth on page 2 of the Offer to Purchase, or fax a completed and
executed Letter of Transmittal to the Investment Adviser, also to the attention of TEF Fund Operations, at the fax number set forth in Item�1 of the Offer to Purchase. Investors whose broker of record is a Merrill financial adviser should send
or deliver, or fax, the completed and executed Letter of Transmittal (the Tender Offer Form will suffice) to their financial adviser instead of to the Investment Adviser. The completed and executed Letter of Transmittal must be received either by
mail or by fax, no later than the Expiration Date. The Fund recommends that all documents be submitted by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by facsimile transmission. An investor choosing to fax a Letter of Transmittal must also send or
deliver the original completed and executed Letter of Transmittal (the Tender Offer Form will suffice) promptly thereafter.  Any investor tendering an Interest pursuant to this Offer may withdraw its tender at any time on or before on the Expiration Date and, if Interests have not then been accepted by the Fund, at any time after February�29, 2008. To be
effective, any notice of withdrawal must be timely received by the Investment Adviser at the address or fax numbers set forth in Item�1 of the Offer to Purchase, or in the case of Merrill clients, by their Merrill financial adviser. A form to
use to give notice of withdrawal is available by calling, in the case of Merrill clients, their Merrill financial adviser or, for all other investors, the Investment Adviser at the phone number indicated on page 2 of the Offer to Purchase. Interests
properly withdrawn shall not thereafter be deemed to be tendered for purposes of the Offer. However, withdrawn Interests may be re-tendered prior to the Expiration Date by following the procedures described above.  (viii) For purposes of the Offer, the Fund will be deemed to have accepted (and thereby purchased) Interests that are tendered when it
gives oral or written notice to the tendering investor of its election to purchase such Interests.  (ix) If more than the
Maximum Amount of Interests are duly tendered to the Fund prior to the expiration of the Offer and not withdrawn, the Fund will, in its sole discretion, either (a)�accept the additional Interests permitted to be accepted pursuant to Rule
13e-4(f)(1)(ii) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; (b)�extend the Offer, if necessary, and increase the amount of Interests that the Fund is offering to purchase to an amount it believes sufficient to accommodate the excess
Interests tendered as well as any Interests tendered during the extended Offer; or (c)�accept Interests tendered on or before the Expiration Date for payment on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate estimated net asset value of tendered
Interests.  (x) The purchase of Interests pursuant to the Offer will have the effect of increasing the proportionate
interest in the Fund of investors who do not tender Interests. Investors who retain their Interests may be subject to increased risks that may possibly result from the reduction in the Fund�s aggregate assets resulting from payment for the
Interests tendered. These risks include the potential for greater volatility due to decreased diversification. However, the Fund believes that this result is unlikely given the nature of the Fund�s investment program. Additionally, a reduction
in the aggregate assets of the Fund may result in higher costs for remaining investors to the extent that certain expenses borne by the Fund are relatively fixed and may not decrease if assets decline. These effects may be reduced or eliminated to
the extent that additional subscriptions for Interests are made by new and existing investors from time to time.  (xi) Not
applicable.  (xii) An investor who tenders its entire Interest to the Fund for repurchase generally will recognize capital
gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received by such investor and such investor�s adjusted tax basis in its Interest. Gain, if any, will be recognized by a tendering investor only as and after the total proceeds
received by such investor exceed the investor�s adjusted tax basis in its Interest. A loss, if any, will be recognized only after the tendering investor has received full payment. This capital gain or loss will be short-term or long-term
depending upon the investor�s holding period for its Interest at the time the gain or loss is recognized. However, a tendering investor will recognize ordinary income to the 
 �
5 



extent such investor�s allocable share of the Fund�s �unrealized receivables� exceeds the investor�s basis in such unrealized
receivables, as determined pursuant to the United States Treasury Regulations. For these purposes, accrued but untaxed market discount if any, on securities held by the Fund will be treated as an unrealized receivable with respect to the tendering
investor. An investor who tenders less than its entire Interest to the Fund for repurchase will recognize gain (but not loss) in a similar manner only to the extent that the amount of the proceeds received exceeds such investor�s adjusted tax
basis in its Interest.  Pursuant to the authority granted to it under the LP Agreement, the Investment Adviser intends to specially
allocate items of Fund capital gain, including short-term capital gain, to a withdrawing investor to the extent its liquidating distribution would otherwise exceed its adjusted tax basis in its Interest. Such a special allocation may result in the
withdrawing investor recognizing capital gain, which may include short-term gain, in the investor�s last taxable year in the Fund, thereby reducing the amount of any long-term capital gain recognized during the tax year in which it receives its
liquidating distribution upon withdrawal.  (2) Not applicable.  (b) At the present time, the Fund is not aware of any intentions of the Investment Adviser or any of the Managers or members of the Board of the Fund to
have their Interests acquired in this tender offer.  Item�5. Past Contracts, Transactions, Negotiations and Agreements With Respect to the
Issuer�s Securities.  The Fund�s PPM and the LP Agreement, which were provided to each Partner in advance of subscribing for
Interests, provide that the Fund�s Board has the discretion to determine whether the Fund will purchase Interests from Partners from time to time pursuant to written tenders. The Fund is not aware of any contract, arrangement, understanding or
relationship relating, directly or indirectly, to this tender offer (whether or not legally enforceable) between: (i)�the Fund and the Investment Adviser or the Fund�s Board, or any person controlling the Fund or controlling the Investment
Adviser or the Fund�s Board; and (ii)�any person, with respect to Interests. On October�25, 2007, the Master Fund offered to repurchase Interests as of December�31, 2007 from partners and approximately $20 million worth of
Interests was tendered.  Item�6. Purposes of This Tender Offer and Plans or Proposals of the Issuer or Affiliate.  (a) The purpose of the Offer to Purchase is to provide liquidity to investors who hold Interests as contemplated by and in accordance with the procedures
set forth in the LP Agreement.  (b) Interests that are tendered to the Fund in connection with the Offer to Purchase, if accepted for
repurchase, will be repurchased, resulting in an increase in the Sharing Ratios of remaining Partners in the Fund (assuming no further issuances of Interests).  (c) Neither the Fund nor the Investment Adviser nor any of the Managers or Directors of the Fund (nor members of the Board of Directors) have any plans or proposals that relate to or would result in: (1)�the
acquisition by any person of additional Interests in the Fund (other than the Fund�s intention to accept subscriptions for Interests from time to time in the discretion of the Fund), or the disposition of Interests in the Fund (except for
periodic discretionary solicitations of tender offers); (2)�an extraordinary transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving the Fund; (3)�any material change in the present distribution policy or indebtedness or
capitalization of the Fund; (4)�any change in the identity of the Investment Adviser or the Managers or Directors of the Fund, or in the management of the Fund including, but not limited to, any plans or proposals to change the number or the
term of the Managers or Directors of the Fund, to fill any existing vacancy for a Manager or Director of the Fund or to change any material term of the investment advisory arrangements with the Investment Adviser; (5)�a sale or transfer of a
material amount of assets of the Fund (other than as the Managers or Directors determine may be necessary or appropriate to fund all or a portion of the purchase price for Interests acquired pursuant to the Offer to Purchase or in connection with
the ordinary 
 �
6 



portfolio transactions of the Fund); (6)�any other material change in the Fund�s structure or business, including any plans or proposals to make
any changes in its fundamental investment policies, as amended, for which a vote would be required by Section�13 of the 1940 Act; or (7)�any changes in the LP Agreement or other actions that might impede the acquisition of control of the
Fund by any person. Because Interests are not traded in any market, Items (6), (7)�and (8)�of Item�1006(c) of Regulation M-A are not applicable to the Fund.  Item�7. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.  (a) The Fund expects that the
purchase price for Interests acquired pursuant to the Offer to Purchase, which will not exceed the Maximum Amount (unless the Fund elects to purchase a greater amount), will be derived from: (1)�cash on hand; (2)�the proceeds of the sale
of and/or delivery of securities and portfolio assets held by the Fund; and/or (3)�possibly borrowings, as described in paragraph (b)�below.  (b) Neither the Fund nor the Investment Adviser nor any of the Managers or Directors of the Fund have determined at this time to borrow funds to purchase tendered Interests in connection with the Offer to Purchase.
However, depending on the dollar amount of Interests tendered and prevailing general economic and market conditions, the Fund, in its sole discretion, may decide to seek to borrow money to fund all or a portion of the purchase price. The Endowment
Master Fund, L.P. (the �Master Fund�) currently has a borrowing facility with Custodial Trust Company with sufficient capacity to facilitate the entire repurchase offer in full.  Item�8. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.  (a) Based on November�30, 2007 estimated values, Mr.�John�A. Blaisdell, a Manager, Director, and Co-Principal Executive Officer beneficially owns $284,559 of Interests in the Fund and an aggregate of $1,585,420 of the
