Author
Eric Aguiar
Officer Eric Aguiar, LLB has a law degree and several years of police experience. Many of his articles are currently being used for training purposes by various entities. He has a passion for officer safety and for improving the community/police relationship.
The disparity that exists between the public's expectation of police services and what the department is actually capable of is of grave concern.
The amount of police officer injury and death that has been occurring for several years is alarming.
Minimum training requirements must be updated to meet the current needs and dangers.
