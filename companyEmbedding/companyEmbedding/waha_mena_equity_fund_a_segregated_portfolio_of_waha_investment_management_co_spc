2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.









2017 GDP Forecasts by Country, Region and Market (%)
We expect the prolonged expansion phase of the growth cycle to continue in 2017

Company Profile
                         
      

Waha Capital is an Abu Dhabi-listed investment company that offers shareholders and third-party investors exposure to high-potential opportunities in diversified asset classes.
The Company manages assets across several sectors, including aircraft leasing, healthcare, financial services, energy, infrastructure, industrial real estate and capital markets.
Through its Principal Investments unit, Waha Capital has established a strong investment track-record, deploying capital in sectors that display robust demand fundamentals and that have been prioritised by governments in the Middle East and North Africa region. 
The company has also built a strong capability in managing global and regional credit and equity portfolios, which have enhanced the diversification and liquidity of Waha Capital’s balance sheet.
The excellent performance of the company’s principal investments and capital markets portfolios has laid the foundations for the launch of an asset management business aimed at third-party investors.   
Established in 1997, Waha Capital has been consistently profitable – its investment teams are singularly focused on deploying capital efficiently, where they see and can add value, in order to deliver sustainable and attractive returns to shareholders and investment partners.
The management team has extensive experience operating in the regional market, with expertise honed at leading international blue-chip corporations and financial institutions. Waha Capital also benefits from a roster of prominent local shareholders that includes Mubadala Development Company, and a distinguished board, chaired by H.E. Hussain Jasim Al Nowais.
While Waha Capital manages investments globally, the company remains deeply rooted in Abu Dhabi's economy and operates at the centre of influential business networks in the United Arab Emirates and the wider Middle East region. By investing in key growth sectors, the company is a contributor to the ongoing development of a dynamic private sector – an important component of the region's economic diversification plans.

2017 Investment Outlook


































The Long Cycle Continues





We expect the long post-crisis economic recovery to continue in 2017. As a base case, we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries, with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since 2010.
From an investment perspective, our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets. We prefer equities over credit and credit over rates, but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given 1) elevated valuations, 2) limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and 3) limits to economic growth potential. Broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds, identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt.
In some respects, our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into 2016. The key difference for 2017 revolves around four emerging transitions. Populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks. Concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation. Years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy. And concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for de-regulation.
Transition will be an evolving theme in 2017, and we will be re-visiting it in our publications throughout the year. In this Investment Outlook, we highlight specific signposts we will be watching, both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions.









Three Key Questions







Is it time to de-risk?
Is it time to de-risk?
No. We think de-risking would be premature, at
least from a purely return-generating standpoint. We
expect the macro environment to remain supportive
of risk assets during 2017 amid a slow-but-steady
expansion in developed markets and an acceleration
of growth in some emerging markets.

What’s driving the expansion?
What’s driving the expansion?
We believe this is a slow-growth recovery best
explained by cyclical economic drivers. We believe
the concerns about the developed world being mired
in a pattern of underinvestment and stalled growth—
so-called secular stagnation—are overdone.

Where do we see opportunities?
Where do we see opportunities?
In a low-return world, we look for sources of
return beyond conventional stock and bond market
approaches. We also think range-bound or volatile
markets create opportunities for more dynamic
investment strategies.

Transitions We’re Watching in 2017


















												Globalism to Populism
											



The biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend.















												Stagnation to Inflation
											



We expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the US.















												Monetary to Fiscal Policy
											



The focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending, as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability.
















												Regulation to De-Regulation
											



We see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive de-regulation.

Waha Capital: Identifying opportunities to add value






24 December, 2014























Salem Al Noaimi, CEO and MD at Waha Capital spoke to Zoya Malik about the company's strategic investments aimed at building sustainable and attractive returns for shareholders





Tell us about Waha Capital's business functions. "Waha Capital is a leading Abu Dhabi-based investment company with two main businesses -Principal Investments and Capital Markets. The company's aim is to build sustainable and attractive returns for shareholders and investment partners by managing and deploying capital in areas where the company sees opportunity and can add value.  "Waha Capital's principal investments span across several sectors, including aircraft leasing, healthcare, financial services, industrial real estate, energy and infrastructure.  In the Middle East region, we look to invest in sectors with high potential for growth and that have been prioritised by governments. Our investments include stakes in New York-listed aircraft leasing company AerCap Holdings, healthcare provider Anglo-Arabian Healthcare, consumer finance firm Dunia Finance, and oil and gas services companies National Petroleum Services and Stanford Marine Group, as well as the MENA Infrastructure Fund.  "Our capital markets division adds both diversification and liquidity to our asset mix and income stream. We have successfully managed an internal portfolio of global credit securities for three years, and have a very strong performance track record in this area, outperforming relevant benchmarks. We are now also managing a regional equities portfolio. In 2015, Waha Capital will launch a CEEMEA fixed income fund as well as a MENA equity fund, opening these opportunities up to third-party investors."



How do you select projects to own and sponsor and vet prospective partners? "Waha Capital has carried out in-depth research to assess sectors of the regional economy with the highest scope for growth, and we use our extensive network to source proprietary transactions.  "We are looking to take significant stakes, with a strong element of control, in high potential companies. At the same time, we employ a disciplined approach to risk management, with internal committees employed to vet analysis and recommendations.

     "In recent years, Waha Capital has focused on enhancing value creation across its portfolio companies. We have spent time and energy increasing our operational expertise, developing strategic relationships and building a strong network within the sectors in which we are engaged."   How about Waha Capital's performance?   Is the company financially robust? "Waha Capital has delivered exceptional performance over the last couple of years.  We achieved strong financial results in 2013 with record net income and expect another year of even higher record-breaking financial results. The company's net profit in the first nine months of 2014 reached almost AED 1.6 billion.  This was due to strong performance by our portfolio companies, particularly Aercap and Dunia Finance, as well as our Capital Markets division.  "We have reduced our leverage ratio to 22 per cent from 37 per cent at the end of 2013, while delivering a return on equity of 48 per cent in the first three quarters of this year. This is extremely encouraging, especially given the historical uncertainty in the global economy, and compares favourably with our peers. We are frequently approached by other investors, and are open to co-investment opportunities with suitable partners who share Waha Capital's focus on value creation. "Waha Capital's exceptional track record and the prudent management of our balance sheet, means that the company is in an excellent position to further expand and diversify our investments.  "The company currently has approximately AED 3.5 billion of available funding that can be deployed for investment. We believe that there are attractive opportunities in the region in key sectors such as healthcare, education, energy and infrastructure, which are benefitting from strong demand fundamentals. Governments are investing heavily in these areas, and also encouraging greater private investment." Can you tell us about your investment strategy?  "We have always believed in in-depth research, sourcing proprietary investments, diversification and taking a long-term view. That strategy has served us well through cycles -- not just when markets have been buoyant, but also when the global economy has been in recession. Waha Capital, which was established in 1997, has been profitable for 12 consecutive years. "Diversification has been an important element of our strategy, and our direct investments in fast growing companies in the region, are balanced by liquid investments in capital markets." What has been Waha Capital's experience in Aercap?  "AerCap Holdings has been one of our most successful investments. Waha Capital has been a long-standing investor in the aircraft leasing company, with strong board representation, and we have been rewarded with very impressive returns. This year, AerCap acquired International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) from American International Group, Inc (AIG), creating significant value.   AerCap is now the largest aircraft leasing firm in the world, with a total of 1,676 aircraft leased, managed or under contract and around $25 billion worth of orders on its books. The transaction resulted in a strong increase in earnings per share, from $0.79 in as of the end of September 2013 to $1.65 as of September of this year, which continues to feed through to Waha Capital's financial results. "Waha Capital has recently entered into two hedging and financing transactions on the company's Aercap shares, limiting the company's downside equity market risk while allowing future upside participation. The transaction also helped to raise significant funds for debt repayment and the further diversification of the company's portfolio."   What about your experience with other investments? "In the UAE, we are a founding investor in Dunia Finance, through a strategic partnership with Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Development Company, Fullerton Financial Holdings -- a subsidiary of Singapore's Temasek Holdings -- and Al Moosa Enterprises.  "Dunia has delivered impressive growth, despite being launched in 2008 amid a turbulent global environment. The company is responding to strong mass market demand for consumer finance solutions, and has successfully expanded into other geographies and new business lines. Its loan portfolio has expanded consistently and rapidly, and has grown by just over a third this year. "Waha Capital is also a general partner in the MENA Infrastructure Fund I -- participating in the joint venture that manages the fund -- as well as a limited partner investor. This first fund has made some excellent long-term investments across the region and we remain very bullish on the sector, given the commitment that governments across the region are displaying to upgrading and expanding infrastructure. A second fund is likely to be launched in due course.  "We see high potential in our two most recent investments in the healthcare and energy sectors.  "In June 2013, Waha Capital acquired Anglo Arabian Healthcare (AAH) - a healthcare group set up to own and operate hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and diagnostic centres across the United Arab Emirates.  AAH has performed well, breaking even less than a year after its acquisition.  The company continues to pursue a number of potential acquisitions and is making steady progress on its green-field hospital and clinic projects. "In September 2014, we established a new unit to drive our future investments in the energy sector across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.  The unit, which is part of Waha Capital's Principal Investments division, has made its first investment -- in National Petroleum Services (NPS) -- as part of a consortium that has acquired the UAE-headquartered oil and gas services company. NPS is a well-established company with a strong regional management team. We are excited to support the company in continuing to expand its service offering and geographic reach. "We will continue to build and expand our healthcare and energy platforms.  For example, in the area of healthcare, we intend to invest around AED 500 million in the next three to five years." Why did you announce a share buy-back programme in October and how will it be executed over the coming 12 months? "We have instated a share buy-back programme because we believe our share is undervalued and therefore represents good value for the company and its shareholders.  We also want to reward our investors in a year when the company has performed so well.  We have faith in the future growth of the company and are very confident in our ability to continue to deliver strong value. The share buy-back programme, which was approved by the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) in October 2014, is up to 10 per cent of outstanding shares.  We have 12 months to execute the buy back and will exercise that right according to market conditions." What are your new plans and initiatives for 2015?  "We are looking to further expand and diversify our investments, with a focus on areas with high growth potential that have been prioritised by regional governments, such as healthcare, education, energy and infrastructure.   "We are also growing our capital markets business, and will look to take a couple of products to market, aimed at third-party investors.   "We believe the macro-economic fundamentals of the UAE and of our region generally remain strong, and therefore very supportive of our strategy. The GCC has been running current account and budget surpluses for several years, and government spending is therefore likely to remain strong over the coming years. This is producing a multiplier effect in the wider economy, which allows the private sector to thrive. Such an environment presents many attractive opportunities for Waha Capital."  © Banker Middle East 2014

About us.



You are here: MENA Infrastructure » About us





MENA Infrastructure is a pre-eminent infrastructure equity investor and fund manager focusing on investments in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENAT) region.
Founded in 2007 and owned by HSBC, Fajr Capital and Waha Capital, MENA Infrastructure currently manages a US$300 million infrastructure fund from its headquarters in the Dubai International Financial Centre. MENA Infrastructure has the premier infrastructure private equity team in the region. The team is fully supported by a network of sponsors, investors, intermediaries and strategic partners that command significant influence in the region’s business communities. With these resources and networks at its disposal, the firm offers a unique combination of unrivalled origination capability with proven investment and execution expertise. MENA Infrastructure has executed some of the region’s landmark transactions and holds a collection of well-regarded awards which bear testament to its superior performance.
Having successfully invested its first generation fund, the firm is now seeking to raise MENA Infrastructure Fund II, targeting US$500 million in commitments. This will allow the firm to leverage its reputation and connectivity, and to continue its proven strategy to capitalise on the increasing flow of attractive infrastructure opportunities generated by rapid development in the high growth MENAT economies.
Our Investment Strategy
The MENAT region includes some of the fastest growing economies of the world. With Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expected to grow at the rate of over 4.5% over the next five years, (against just 2.5% for advanced economies) and population growth forecast of over 1.7% (against just 1.0% for the world over a similar period), the region’s macroeconomic characteristics compare favourably to developed OECD markets. As governments in the region concentrate on the provision of much-needed public services and allocate resources to critical areas, they increasingly look to the private sector for the delivery of infrastructure-related services.  This drives the need for private sector participation through skill and capital either in the form of public private partnerships (PPPs) or regular privatisations.
MENA Infrastructure acts as:

a primary sponsor or co-sponsor of infrastructure and energy projects and companies which are being tendered or are already in development or under construction (“greenfield opportunities); or
an investor or co-investor of infrastructure and energy companies which are already operational (“brownfield opportunities”).

As well as equity capital, MENA Infrastructure brings extensive sector knowledge, regional relationships and financial expertise to the projects and companies in which it invests.
Our definition of the infrastructure is tailored to meet the specific needs of the region. We invest in:

Energy: including power generation (through IPPs and IWPPs), transmission and distribution, hydrocarbon transmission and storage
Transport: including airports, roads, marine ports, and rail
Environmental Services: waste water treatment, water desalination, and waste management
Social Infrastructure: hospitals, education facilities, schools, and social housing.
