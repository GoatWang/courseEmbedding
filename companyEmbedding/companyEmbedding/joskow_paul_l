                           Title IV of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 created a market for electric utility emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2).
                              Recent papers have argued that flaws in the design of the auctions that are part of this market have adversely affected its
                              performance. These papers incorrectly assume that trade can only occur at auctions, however. Our empirical analysis of the
                              SO2 emissions market shows that the auctions have become a small part of a relatively efficient market and that the auction
                              design problems that have attracted the most attention have had no effect on actual market prices

A quantitative analysis of pricing behavior in California's wholesale electricity market during Summer 2000 by

                           During the Summer of 2000, wholesale electricity prices in California were nearly 500% higher than they were during the same
                              months in 1998 or 1999. This price explosion was unexpected and has called into question whether electricity restructuring
                              will bring the benefits of competition promised to consumers. This paper examines the factors that explain this increase in
                              wholesale electricity prices. Competitive benchmark prices for Summer of 2000 are simulated, taking account of all relevant
                              supply and demand factors -- gas prices, demand, imports from other states, and emission permit prices. The simulated competitive
                              benchmark prices are then compared with the actual prices observed. A large gap between is found between the benchmark competitive
                              prices and observed prices, suggesting that the prices observed during Summer 2000 reflect, in part, the exercise of market
                              power by suppliers. Supplier behavior during high-price hours is then examined. Suppliers withheld supply from the market
                              that would have been profitable for price-taking firms to sell at the market price

                           This study explores the effect of regulatory and political constraints on the level of CEO compensation for 87 state-regulated
                              electric utilities during 1978-1990. The results suggest that political pressures may constrain top executive pay levels in
                              this industry. First, CEOs of firms operating in regulatory environments characterized by investment banks as relatively pro-consumer'
                              receive lower compensation than do CEOs of firms in environments ranked as more friendly to investors. Second, CEO pay is
                              lower for utilities with relatively high or rising rates, or a higher proportion of industrial sales, consistent with earlier
                              research that describes political pressures on electricity rates. Finally, attributes of the commission appointment and tenure
                              rules affect CEO compensation in ways consistent with the political constraint hypothesis: for example, pay is lower in states
                              with elected commissioners than in states where commissioners are appointed by the governor, all else equal. Despite apparently
                              effective pressure to constrain pay levels in this sector, however, we find no evidence of related intra-industry variation
                              in the sensitivity of pay to firm financial performance

                           This study explores the dynamic structure of the pay-for- performance relationship in CEO compensation and quantifies the
                              effect of introducing a more complex model of firm financial performance on the estimated performance sensitivity of executive
                              pay. The results suggest that current compensation responds to past performance outcomes, but that the effect decays considerably
                              within two years. This contrasts sharply with models of infinitely persistent performance effects implicitly assumed in much
                              of the empirical compensation literature. We find that both accounting and market performance measures influence compensation
                              and that the salary and bonus component of pay as well as total compensation have become more sensitive to firm financial
                              performance over the past two decades. There is no evidence that boards fail to penalize CEOs for poor financial performance
                              or reward them disproportionately well for good performance. Finally, the data suggest that boards may discount extreme performance
                              outcomes -both high and low - relative to performance that lies within some ormal' band in setting compensation

                              Despite all of the talk about "deregulation" of the electricity sector, a large number of non-market mechanisms have been
                                 imposed on emerging competitive wholesale and retail markets. These mechanisms include spot market price caps, operating reserve
                                 requirements, non-price rationing protocols, and administrative protocols for managing system emergencies. Many of these mechanisms
                                 have been carried over from the old regime of regulated monopoly and continue to be justified as necessary responses to market
                                 imperfections of various kinds and engineering requirements dictated by the special physical attributes of electric power
                                 networks. This paper seeks to bridge the gap between economists focused on designing competitive market mechanisms and engineers
                                 focused on the physical attributes and engineering requirements they perceive as being needed for operating a reliable electric
                                 power system. The paper starts by deriving the optimal prices and investment program when there are price-insensitive retail
                                 consumers, and their load serving entities can choose any level of rationing they prefer contingent on real time prices. It
                                 then examines the assumptions required for a competitive wholesale and retail market to achieve this optimal price and investment
                                 program. The paper analyses the implications of relaxing several of these assumptions. First, it analyzes the interrelationships
                                 between regulator-imposed price caps, capacity obligations, and system operator procurement, dispatch and compensation arrangements.
                                 It goes on to explore the implications of potential network collapses, the concomitant need for operating reserve requirements
                                 and whether market prices will provide incentives for investments consistent with these reserve requirements. JEL Classifications:

                              The collapse of California₂s electricity restructuring and competition program has attracted attention around the world. Prices
                                 in California₂s competitive wholesale electricity market increased by 500% between the second half of 1999 and the second
                                 half of 2000. For the first four months of 2001, wholesale spot prices averaged over $300/Mwh, ten times what they were is
                                 1998 and 1999. Some customers have been required involuntarily to curtail electricity consumption in response to supply shortages.
                                 While wholesale prices rose dramatically, retail prices were fixed until early in 2001. 2 As a result, California₂s two largest
                                 utilities -- Pacific Gas & Electric (PG & E) and Southern California Edison (SCE) -- were paying far more for wholesale power
                                 than they were able to resell it for at retail. Both effectively became insolvent in January 2001 and stopped paying their
                                 bills for power and certain other financial obligations. PG & E declared bankruptcy on April 6, 2001 and its reorganization

                              We examine the performance attributes of a merchant transmission investment framework that relies on ₃market driven₄ transmission
                                 investment to provide the infrastructure to support competitive wholesale markets for electricity. Under a stringent set of
                                 assumptions, the merchant investment model has a remarkable set of attributes that appear to solve the natural monopoly problem
                                 and the associated need for regulating transmission companies traditionally associated with electric transmission networks.
                                 We expand the merchant model upon which these conclusions are based to incorporate imperfections in wholesale electricity
                                 markets, lumpiness in transmission investment opportunities, stochastic attributes of transmission networks and associated
                                 property rights definition issues, the effects of the behavior of system operators and transmission owners on transmission
                                 capacity and reliability, coordination and bargaining considerations, forward contract, commitment and asset specificity issues.
                                 Incorporating these more realistic attributes of transmission networks and the behavior of transmission owners and system
                                 operators significantly undermines the attractive properties of the merchant investment model. Relying primarily on a market
                                 driven investment framework to govern investment in electric transmission networks is likely to lead to inefficient investment
                                 decisions and undermine the performance of competitive markets for electricity. A significant research challenge is to design
                                 regulatory mechanisms for system operators and incumbent transmission owners and a better framework for defining transmission
                                 property rights that will stimulate efficient investments by regulated incumbent transmission owners and by merchant entrants
                                 responding to market opportunities when they are the most efficient suppliers

                              This essay discusses U.S. energy policy and the associated evolution of energy supply, energy demand, energy prices and the
                                 industrial organization of the domestic energy industries during the period 1991 through 2000. This period covers the last
                                 two years of the George H.W. Bush administration and the entire Clinton administration. It begins with an "energy crisis"
                                 stimulated by the invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent Gulf War and ends with an "energy crisis" caused by significant increases
                                 in oil and, especially, natural gas prices, the collapse of California's new competitive electricity markets and the threat
                                 of electricity shortages throughout the Western U.S. Both "energy crises" led the sitting Presidents' administrations to develop
                                 national energy strategies and to try to convince Congress to enact comprehensive energy legislation to implement them. Neither
                                 "energy crisis" had the severe economic impact or led to the kinds of dramatic, and often ill-conceived, policy responses
                                 observed following the two oil shocks of the 1970s. The 1990-91 "energy crisis" was short-lived and interest in energy policy
                                 soon faded. It would not be surprising if the latest "energy crisis" follows a similar course

                              We analyze a number of unstudied aspects of retail electricity competition. We first explore the implications of load profiling
                                 of consumers whose traditional meters do not permit the measurement of their real-time consumption. The combination of retail
                                 competition and load profiling does not yield the second-best prices given the non-price-responsiveness of retail consumers.
                                 We then examine the incentives that electricity retailers have to install each of two types of advanced metering equipment.
                                 Finally, we consider the implications of physical limitations on the ability of system operators to cut off individual consumers
                                 relying instead of "zonal" rationing of large groups of individual consumers

                              This paper investigates the effect of firm size and ownership structure on technology adoption decisions, using data on the
                                 electric utility industry. We argue that traditional models of technology diffusion are subject to sample selectivity biases
                                 that may overstate the effect of firm size on adoption probabilities. By extending conventional hazard rate models to use
                                 information on both adoption and non-adoption decisions, we differentiate between firms' opportunities for adoption and their
                                 underlying adoption propensities. The results suggest that large firms and investor-owned electric utilities are likely to
                                 adopt new technologies earlier than their smaller and publicly-owned counterparts. Moreover, the selection biases from conventional
                                 statistical models can lead one to overstate size effects by a factor of two and to understate ownership structure and factor
                                 cost effects by two to four times

                              Provides a comprehensive, in-depth description and evaluation of the first three years' experience with the U.S. Acid Rain
                                 Program. This environmental control program is the world's first large-scale use of a tradable emission permit system for
                                 achieving environmental goals. The book analyzes the behavior and performance of the market for emissions permits, called
                                 allowances in the Acid Rain Program, and quantifies emission reductions, compliance costs, and cost savings associated with
                                 the trading program. The book also includes chapters on the historical context in which this pioneering program developed
                                 and the political economy of allowance allocations

This title presents recent articles on empirical issues in industrial organization, related primarily to the analysis of imperfect competition. The papers cover empirical analysis of non-cooperative and cooperative oligopoly, auctions, differentiated product markets, dynamic competition and entry, plus selected work on innovation, vertical contractual relationships and incentive issues. New research in these areas relies on detailed data for specific industries, typically integrates modern imperfect competition theory into the empirical specifications, commonly uses structural empirical models derived directly from microeconomic theory, and applies modrn econometric techniques. This work and the associated techniques play an increasingly important role in antitrust policy, market design and in newly deregulated markets.

Natural Gas: From Shortages to Abundance in the United States

Article Information




Abstract
					The history of natural gas wellhead and pipeline regulation, deregulation and regulatory reforms are discussed. These reforms brought natural gas shortages and pipeline inefficiencies to an end. They also created an economic platform that could support unanticipated developments in the supply and costs of domestic natural gas. Such unanticipated developments emerged in the last few years as several technological innovations came together to make it commercially attractive to development US shale gas deposits located deep in the earth. How and why shale gas supplies will lead to dramatic changes in the United States' energy future with appropriate environmental regulatory reforms are discussed.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
