WELCOME
 To Jon & Rachael Goldsberry's
WEBSITE






Rachael is a former college athlete, coach and mother. She was struggling to find the energy she needed to make it through the day. She starts each day at 4am and ends it around 10pm after working, coaching and spending time with her family. When she started the 24 Day Challenge she was hesitant of getting any results because nothing had worked before. However, after day 11 things changed drastically for her! She lost 7 pounds and went from a size 10 to a size 4 and gained more energy than she had since high school! Advocare has also given her the ability to dream again and to see that anything is possible when you have the right vehicle to help yourself and others! 

Jon is a former NFL Fullback that has been in great shape through life until the past few years. After saying no to 30+ Advocare Distributors over a 10 year period, putting on extra weight, and not feeling great about his appearance and physical well being Jon finally started Advocare products in April 2015. Thanks to the 24 Day Challenge, he lost 16 pounds and 9 inches overall. His energy has been great and he feels much better on a daily basis. In addition to feeling better, he has been able to kick some bad habits and help others do the same in an effort to meet personal goals physically and financially and maintain or exceed those goals continuously.

JOHN J. GOLDSBERRY - John J. Goldsberry, son of 
					Thomas and Elizabeth (Landsaw) Goldsberry, was born in Ross 
					county, Ohio, February 3, 1827. His parents moved to Boone 
					county in the year 1832, settling in Washington township. 
					The hero of our sketch was just four years old, when he 
					began to fight the battle of life in the woods of Boone 
					county. He knew what it was to begin at the beginning and 
					work to develop a new country. All the hardships and 
					privations of pioneer life were before him. His long life 
					proved that he was made of the stuff that could endure and 
					hold his end of the handspike at all log rollings and take 
					his place at the raising of a cabin and carry up his corner. 
					His push and energy put him at the forefront of every 
					enterprise and he became experienced in all the trials and 
					hardships that devolved upon a good and willing citizen in a 
					new country. Through the experience of his early manhood, he 
					could tell enough stories of its incidents to make a book 
					and it would all be interesting reading for those of this 
					generation who know little of those who framed and laid the 
					foundations of the county. 

					Mr. Goldsberry was one of the real pioneers and his stories 
					were in keeping with the stories of all his co-laborers in 
					the building of Boone. The battle against the wild woods and 
					the swamps, against the miasmas and inconveniences of poor 
					roads, limited means and real comforts of life. He was 
					married October 15, 1859, to Miss Josina Hebb, who was born 
					in Monongahela county, Virginia, October 15, 1832. To this 
					union were born four children: Joseph L., Clement L., Josina, 
					and Belle -- the three latter are deceased; Joseph L., 
					married Miss Ferguson and lives in Clinton county just 
					across the county line from the old homestead. Mrs. 
					Goldsberry died March 11, 1865. Mr. Goldsberry was remarried 
					November 19, 1865 to Hannah M. Goldsberry, a very distant 
					relative, of Ross county, Ohio. To this union were born 
					Annie B., Alma A., Amos A.; and Jessie C., who died June 22, 
					1874. All the deceased members of the family were buried in 
					Brush Creek cemetery, Washington township. Mrs. Hannah M. 
					Goldsberry passed over the river April 15, 1905 and Mr. 
					Goldsberry joined the company on the other side on August 
					19, 1910. 

					Mr. Goldsberry came paternally of sturdy German ancestors 
					and of an old colonial Virginia family. Thomas Goldsberry, 
					grandfather of our subject was born in Virginia, was a 
					soldier in the Revolutionary war and married Elizabeth, 
					daughter of Peter Putnam, a relative of the famous Israel 
					Putnam of Revolutionary fame. This family were among the 
					very earliest settlers of Massachusetts and Connecticut and 
					were of old English Puritan stock. General Rufus Putnam, 
					brother of Israel Putnam, was the founder of Marietta, Ohio, 
					which was the first town in the state of Ohio. 

					There were born to the grandparents of our subject, Thomas 
					and Elizabeth Goldsberry, ten children: Jacob, Thomas, 
					Susan, John, Mary, Matilda, Peter, Abraham, Isaac and Eliza, 
					all born in Virginia or Ohio. Thomas moved in a very early 
					day after the Revolutionary war to Harper's Ferry, Virginia, 
					and settled on Hogg Point, where he developed a farm. His 
					brother owned and kept the ferry at that time and was killed 
					by lightning. The western fever seized Mr. Thomas Goldsberry, 
					the grandfather of our subject and early in the 19th century 
					he moved to the state of Ohio, settling at Chillicothe, 
					where he kept a tavern, near which place he built the first 
					grist mill in that part of the state. Later he traded the 
					mill for four hundred acres of land. Here he farmed for a 
					few years when in 1831, he moved to Boone county, Indiana, 
					settling on a farm on Sugar Creek, northeast of Thorntown. 
					He got a deed from "Old Hickory" for one hundred and sixty 
					acres of land, set himself to hewing down the native forest 
					and reared a log cabin in which to rear and protect his 
					family of ten children until 1840, when he sold this farm 
					and lived with his son. In the fall of that year, he died of 
					erysipelas at the good ripe age of eighty years. He was an 
					honest, hard working pioneer. The latchstring of his cabin 
					was always hung out, for any one to pull. All of his 
					children married and raised families. His son, Peter, 
					represented Tippecanoe county in the Indiana Legislature in 
					1852. The aged widow of Thomas Goldsberry died in Tippecanoe 
					county, survived by ten children, fifty-three grandchildren 
					and five great-grandchildren. 

					Thomas Goldsberry, son of the above and father of our 
					subject, was born at Harper's Ferry in 1800. He was reared a 
					farmer and married in Ross county, Ohio, to Elizabeth 
					Landsaw of that county, and to them were born eight 
					children, two of whom died in infancy. The remaining six 
					were William, John, Mary, Sarah, Jacob and Susan. The first 
					three were born in Ohio and the last three were born in 
					Indiana. Mr. Goldsberry, in 1831, moved to Tippecanoe 
					county, Indiana, where Sarah was born, and in the fall of 
					that year he moved to Boone county and entered one hundred 
					and eighteen acres of land in Sugar Creek and Washington 
					townships. He cleared this and erected a hewed log house, 
					where he died August 4, 1860, at the age of sixty years. He 
					was a great hunter and as turkey and deer were plentiful in 
					those early days, he abundantly supplied his table. He was a 
					shoemaker by trade, made a good living and was a substantial 
					citizen. He was a Democrat and he and his wife were members 
					of the Methodist church, in which he was a class leader and 
					steward, and he was also a liberal supporter of his church. 
					The itinerant Methodist preacher of those days made his home 
					at his house. He was held in kindly esteem by all who knew 
					him and reared a good family. 

					It might be interesting to this generation to know how 
					great-grandfather Goldsberry came to Boone county in 1831. 
					There were no roads at that date. We must remember that 
					Johnny was a little boy at that time, only about four years 
					old, and his father and grandfather came to Indiana 
					together, not in the cars, for there were none. The story 
					has been handed down to the family that they came in two 
					wagons. We must remember that there was quite a bunch of 
					them. The father came in an ordinary wagon, drawn by two 
					horses, while the grandfather and his family were in a 
					larger wagon drawn by two yoke of oxen. The men and larger 
					boys walked and the women and smaller children rode in the 
					wagons when tired. They did not say what road they came 
					over, for at that time there was no choice of roads. They 
					must have come to Indiana over the National road as far as 
					Indianapolis, then into Boone county over the Michigan or 
					the Indianapolis and Lafayette road, most probably the 
					latter, as it was in direct line towards the end of their 
					journey. Neither was much of a road at that date. They were 
					merely cut outs, yet full of stumps, bogs and corduroy over 
					the marsh places. There were no bridges over the streams.
					

					Just think a bit how we travel today over nice roads in 
					carriages, automobiles, traction and steam coaches, going 
					one hundred miles, while they could only travel five. It was 
					slow going. It took them weeks to make the journey. There 
					were no taverns. When they stopped for the night, they would 
					have to build a camp fire and sleep in the wagons and on the 
					ground, or most any way to pass the night. The only pleasant 
					feature about the journey was, they could have plenty of 
					fresh meat, for game was plenty along the road side and it 
					helped to garnish many a scanty meal of coffee and bread -- 
					Johnny-cake at that. The entire trip was full of incidents 
					that impressed the minds of the children, so that they could 
					relate them in after years. There were great difficulties to 
					overcome in the bad roads, in the fording of streams, that 
					filled the parents' hearts with great anxiety, lest harm 
					would be fall them. By great care and watchfulness, they 
					made the entire trip in safety and all landed at their 
					destination in good shape. 

					It was in the spring of the year when they came to Indiana, 
					when the roads are at their worst and the streams are 
					swollen. How these brave venturesome people got through 
					seems a mystery to us in our day and age. Early in the fall 
					of the same year, Thomas, father of our hero, moved back to 
					Boone county. It was dryer now and the roads were better and 
					besides, there were plenty of nuts by the road side, which 
					furnished food for the stock, and many a dainty feast for 
					the young folks as well as the older. 

					We have now got the parents, grandparents, the uncles and 
					aunts and the little boy into Hoosierdom; it will be in 
					order to take up the story of the latter and tell how he 
					became full-fledged and grew into manhood and became a 
					useful citizen. You see there is a lad here out of whom we 
					are to make a man and a useful citizen. In this age of Boone 
					county we are inclined to think that a boy did not have much 
					chance in the days of little Johnny Goldsberry. We look at 
					our splendid farms, beautiful homes, good roads, excellent 
					schools, luxurious churches, carriages, steam and trolley 
					coaches, automobiles and flying machines and we say down in 
					our hearts that we do not see how they got along back in the 
					woods, when they did not have any of these things. Just 
					think of it, they did not have any telephones or telegraphs 
					in that day or a mail oftener than once a week. If Mr. 
					Goldsberry wanted to have a log rolling and wished his 
					neighbors to come in and help, he could not step to the 
					telephone before breakfast and call up the whole 
					neighborhood to come over and help a bit. All of you please 
					come at sharp 9 A. M. and we can get done in an hour or so. 
					We can't see for the life of us how they did live when they 
					did not have any of these things. Why, it will take Johnny a 
					whole week to go around and notify the neighbors about the 
					log rolling; and look at the hard work it will be; and 
					besides, if he has to do all that work, he will have no time 
					to play ball or have any fun or good time. My, aren't you 
					glad that you do not have to roll logs or split wood, or 
					walk for miles through the woods to tell the folks a little 
					word. We do not see how anybody could live in the woods and 
					do all that work. 

					Hold on, boys, and let us tell you how Johnny got his work 
					done and at the same time grew into a good and useful man 
					and has been able to do much good in the world. Where did he 
					go to school you ask? We can tell you right at the start 
					that there was no high school in that day. There was not 
					even a grade school. No brick house nor frame. There was no 
					road to go to a school house if there had been a dozen in 
					the neighborhood. He had to go through the woods, sometimes 
					wade in water half knee deep, walk on logs zigzagging 
					through the woods like a worm fence. You should have seen 
					our school house. Round logs, clapboard roof, puncheon floor 
					or dirt, a whole end for a fire place, split logs without 
					backs for seats, greased paper for light, no writing desks, 
					but a big lot of switches over the teacher's desk to aid in 
					getting lessons when a stimulus was needed. This is a gloomy 
					picture for a boy of our day. It will help us to understand, 
					if we will look at the outcome from these adverse 
					environments. 

					John Goldsberry, when a boy, went to a school house of the 
					above style, to his uncle Joseph Caldwell. He there learned 
					to spell every word in the little blue-backed spelling book. 
					By the aid of the spelling matches held in the neighborhood, 
					he became expert as a speller and could turn down rows of 
					boys and girls and in this way mastered the art for that day 
					and often was the last to quit the floor. He was not good in 
					"rithmetic" It was not considered essential. After he came 
					to manhood he mastered enough of it in five days to fit him 
					for the demands of his business through life. 

					At the age of fourteen, he entered the business strife of 
					life for a livelihood. He received for his services twelve 
					and one-half cents per day for good faithful work. In course 
					of time, when he could do a man's labor, his wages were 
					increased to six dollars per month. At the age of twenty, 
					his father remarried, so he left home and learned the 
					carpenter's trade. He applied himself diligently to his 
					business and was soon able to handle the saw, chisel and 
					mallet skillfully and commanded a wage of fifteen dollars 
					per month and board. He was now receiving a skilled man's 
					wage and was soon able to take contracts of his own. He 
					began to make and save money. At the age of thirty-one he 
					was able to buy a farm of forty acres, paying seven hundred 
					and fifty dollars for it. This was the nest egg for his home 
					in Washington township. He was now in position to assume the 
					responsibility of home building and married him a wife as 
					stated in the opening of this sketch. He added gradually to 
					his farm until he accumulated two hundred and eighteen acres 
					of land with clear title. It is improved with substantial 
					buildings and well tiled. In religious opinion, Mr. 
					Goldsberry was very liberal, believing that everyone should 
					be permitted to worship God according to the dictates of his 
					own conscience. In politics, he was a Democrat of the pure 
					Jeffersonian school. In his latter days he became 
					independent, affirming that the leaders had departed from 
					the old landmarks of Jefferson. He was liberal in 
					educational matters, advocating the advance of the school 
					system and giving his children all educational advantages 
					that the country would afford. He held the office of school 
					director for many years and built the first brick school 
					house in Washington township. He was a Mason, member of the 
					Thorntown Lodge No. 113. He was also a member of the 
					Farmer's Alliance of which he was an elector for three 
					years. He was also one of the original Grangers of the 
					county, thus demonstrating that he was a live coal in the 
					community, and alert to every movement that had for its 
					object the bettering the condition of the people. 

					In 1894, he was foreman of the grand jury, which did 
					effective work. He was a man of patient industry, frugal in 
					his habits and all through his long life was faithful in all 
					relations of life to his home, his neighbors, his party and 
					his country. He stood very high as a citizen, a man of 
					intelligence and knowledge and a gifted conversationalist. 
					His knowledge of affairs, his wonderful memory gave to him a 
					store house of knowledge and he could bring it to the front 
					and put it on display at pleasure to himself and for the 
					enlightenment and pleasure of others. He was a wide reader 
					and his mind was stored with valuable information. He was a 
					subscriber of the first newspaper published in the county, 
					the "Lebanon Pioneer." Uncle John says that the first church 
					built in Washington township was a Union meeting house and 
					his mother wove cloth and sold it to pay for the sash for 
					the windows and they had real glass for light. 

					The experience of Mr. Goldsberry is the experience of the 
					generation of men that laid the foundations of Boone county, 
					and in fact, the men that carved out the state of Indiana. 
					The first fifty years in this state was a life of toil and 
					sacrifice. That period covers the settlement and largely the 
					material development of the state. The mud sills were laid, 
					the roads cut out, streams bridged, farms cleared, school 
					houses and churches erected, orchards planted, and homes 
					established. All this while the citizens were fighting 
					fevers and malarial diseases. They faced three financial 
					disasters and fought the battles of Mexico and the Civil 
					war. To do this great work required just such men as John J. 
					Goldsberry -- men of brawn and brain -- men with a spirit 
					that dared to do -- men that faced the demands of the age in 
					which they lived. In this day we say that they were 
					uneducated. We are inclined to class all as such, that have 
					not, rubbed their backs against the walls of a college, or 
					men who do not have a string of big letters strung after the 
					name their mothers gave them. If this is the only sign of 
					education, then the point is well taken. There may be some 
					doubt about this. The real sign of an education that is 
					worth having is the power to know things and to be able to 
					do things. To fill your place in life and perform well your 
					little part is proof of your qualification. To be able to 
					stand in your place through life, to build a home, rear a 
					family of honorable children and faithfully discharge all 
					your duty to the public and faithfully discharge all trusts 
					confided upon you is the full mission of life. It takes arm, 
					head and heart to do all this work well. No one can say that 
					an individual who can do this successfully is not educated. 
					Many that possess what the world calls education often come 
					short in these virtues. We do not wish to be misunderstood 
					in these reflections upon education; but this rather, you 
					can not make a truly educated person. All the schools in the 
					land can not make an educated citizen. This valued product 
					can not be turned out like a factory turns out a plow or a 
					wagon, a shining perfect model. It takes volition and 
					application of the individual. There are some things that 
					can not be bought nor transmitted, and an educated mind and 
					heart is one of those precious jewels. 

					The first generation of men and women in Indiana had almost 
					no school facilities as we have them today, yet, we venture 
					that there were as large a per cent of them truly educated 
					for life's duties and its accomplishments as there is today. 
					Our grandmothers could hackle flax, card wool, spin flax or 
					wool into fine thread, weave the cloth, cut and make it into 
					garments, burnish the furniture and floor until it would 
					shine like hard-wood finish. They were experts in the 
					culinary art and knew all the laws about sanitary and 
					economic cooking. They were skilled with the needle and 
					could embroider and produce the most delicate fancy needle 
					work. In addition to this, they knew how to doctor and kept 
					an apothecary shop filled with pleasant sage, soothing 
					catnip and bitter boneset. They could cure all the maladies 
					and rear a regular orthodox family of ten or twelve romping 
					boys and girls to manhood and womanhood. 

					Say, be real honest, can our generation with all its boasted 
					improvements of schools, factories, science and art do any 
					better? We can talk around the world now before breakfast 
					and fly in the air like a bird; but will we be able to walk 
					any farther in a life time than our forebears? With all 
					these improvements, how many of us are ready to start out in 
					life to duplicate the life work of our grandparents or even 
					our parents? Why is it, in our day, with all this 
					improvement and the machinery that we have to produce food, 
					raiment, shelter and the necessaries of life, that it is 
					more difficult to start out in life without anything and 
					wage the battle of life? Life is so strenuous today that 
					competition is feverish. We have no time to be social. How 
					many would be willing to take a day off each week and go 
					help a neighbor roll logs? Our venerable citizen, Wallace 
					Hill, who was born in these woods, told us with his own lips 
					that one season he attended log rollings one day a week for 
					over a score of weeks in succession. We have no doubt but 
					what George Coulson, William H. Millikan and James Darrough 
					each would verify the story by saying, "me too," if we had 
					time to interview them. And what would our venerable fellow 
					citizen, Isaac Belles, who is older than the state of 
					Indiana, and will reach his one hundredth anniversary next 
					February, be able to tell us about log rollings and pioneer 
					life. We have eye witnesses and hand witnesses to these yet 
					living among us, and can testify of its truth, 

					That we have made great improvements no one will question, 
					but something has crept into our manners and customs that 
					makes it harder to meet the demands of society than in the 
					days of our fathers. We have laid aside some of the good old 
					customs that we should have clung to tenaciously. It may be 
					that the social fabric is a little rickety and needs a 
					little tightening up, or there may be a leak in the bag 
					somewhere that makes all this furor about the high cost of 
					living. It might be well to look this matter over, and apply 
					some of the unutilized wisdom towards righting the defects, 
					and make things happier in our day or at least remove some 
					of the embarrassment of our times. Some one has said that he 
					who can make two blades of grass grow where only one now 
					grows, would be a great benefactor to the human family. Men 
					have been trying this and have fairly succeeded. Would it 
					not be equally beneficial to the happiness of man, if some 
					one would try his hand in trying to devise some way whereby 
					the ordinary family could make one dollar go as far as two 
					in supplying our wants. There must be a device to cut down 
					the wants or there must be some way to supply them with less 
					money. Who will step out and make this needed improvement? 
					We have not time here to discuss economic ethics. There is 
					one thing that is costing us lots of money that we should 
					look sharply into. Are our schools of brick and stone as 
					successful in preparing men and women for the real battle of 
					life as the school in the woods was? This is a live question 
					and will stir some blood when you try to solve it. When it 
					is discussed, it may bring out what there was in the woods' 
					school that has been left out of the modern school system. 
					Hardship was one element. You know that we are trying every 
					way to make things easy nowadays. Everybody is trying to 
					find the shady side of the road and are just crazy for soft 
					snaps. Mr. Jones will say, I want to give John and Mary a 
					good education, so they will not have as hard a time as I 
					have had. Suppose you stop and analyze this position of Mr. 
					Jones and see where it will end. To teach your children that 
					they should have an easy time means that Mary will be in the 
					parlor while Mrs. Jones is in the kitchen, and John is 
					snoozing in bed, while Mr. Jones is out feeding and building 
					fires and doing other needed chores. 

					In a word, to teach the child that it is to bear none of the 
					burdens of life, is to effeminate it and make it useless and 
					worthless. To give it this lesson at home and then send it 
					to school to obtain an education is like going to the well 
					after a pail of water with a big hole in the bottom of your 
					pail. Long ago it was truly said that there is no excellence 
					without great labor. To develop the intellect requires more 
					real labor than to develop the body. If the body will become 
					flabby without exercise the mind will become worse than 
					flabby. "There is no royal road to wisdom." If a child is 
					started in life with the idea that it is to do nothing, it 
					will have the hardest time of mortals, for it is defying 
					God, for he hath said, "By the sweat of thy brow shalt thou 
					eat thy bread." Such a father would say that Mary has the 
					best teacher was ever in our school, she does not have to 
					work any; the teacher kindly shows her everything. We wonder 
					what the father would say if the teacher would eat Mary's 
					dinner every day and let her starve? The teacher had better 
					eat the dinner of the child than to do its thinking. The 
					best thing about the woods' school was its hard work. The 
					children were always employed. No time for idleness, no time 
					to play. We have heard the saying, "All work and no play 
					makes Jack a dull boy." Be that as it may, yet it is better 
					than the other saying. "All play and no work gives the devil 
					the advantage over Jack." 

					Work did not hurt John or any of the pioneers of Boone. It 
					was through that schooling that they obtained the nerve and 
					the stability of character that enabled them to so well 
					discharge the duties of life. There is not a county in the 
					state that was so hard to develop into beautiful homes and 
					excellent farms as Boone. The hard work required to 
					accomplish this great work, gave our people something better 
					than splendid farms. It gave them splendid character that 
					for a generation has made them shine with luster to this 
					day. It is a rich heritage that has been passed from 
					generation to generation and is evident in our citizenship 
					to this day. Let us as worthy sons, hold on to this virtue 
					as we would cling to life itself. Work is the inspiration of 
					the soul that keeps us from gravitating into worthlessness. 
					Of all the rich heritage that has come to us, there is 
					nothing like the love of toil.

JOHN J. GOLDSBERRY, one of our most prominent 
					pioneers and respected citizens, of Washington township, 
					Boone county, Ind., comes paternally from sturdy German 
					ancestry and an old colonial Virginia family. Thomas 
					Goldsberry, grandfather of our subject, was born in 
					Virginia, was a soldier in the Revolutionary war, and 
					married Elizabeth, daughter of Peter Putnam, a relative of 
					the famous Israel Putnam of Revolutionary fame. This family 
					were of old English Puritan stock, and among the very 
					earliest settlers of Massachusetts and Connecticut. General 
					Rufus Putnam, brother of Israel, was the founder of 
					Marietta, Ohio-the first town settled in that state. The 
					grandfather of our subject, Thomas Goldsberry, and wife were 
					the parents of the following children: Jacob, Thomas, Susan, 
					John, Mary, Matilda, Peter, Abraham, Isaac and Eliza, all 
					born in Virginia or Ohio. Thomas Goldsberry moved at a very 
					early day, probably after the Revolutionary war, to Harper's 
					Ferry, Va., and settled on Hogg Point, where he made a farm. 
					His brother owned and kept the ferry at that time and was 
					killed by lightning. Mr. Goldsberry was also a pioneer in 
					Ross county, Ohio, in the earliest days of its settlement, 
					and here had a good farm and also kept a tavern at 
					Chillicothe, where the old pioneers stopped on their way to 
					the new settlements of Ohio. Here the celebrated Indian 
					chief--Willee Way--was killed by a man named Wolf, in 
					revenge for the murder of his brother, who was killed by the 
					Indians in Kentucky. Mr. Goldsberry built a grist-mill about 
					two miles from old Chillicothe, on the north fork of Paint 
					creek. This was one of the first mills in that part of Ohio. 
					Mr. Goldsberry later sold the mill and bought 400 acres of 
					land, which he farmed awhile, and then, in 1831, he migrated 
					to Indiana, settling in Boone county, on Sugar or Brush 
					creek, two and one-half miles northeast of Thorntown. He 
					entered and partially cleared 160 acres of land, upon which 
					he built a log cabin. About 1840 he sold this farm and lived 
					with his son near La Fayette, where he died, in the fall of 
					1840, of erysipelas, having reached nearly eighty years of 
					age. Mr. Goldsberry was an honest hard-working pioneer, who 
					was noted for his generous hospitality. The latch-string of 
					this old-fashioned pioneer's home always hung out. All of 
					his children married and reared families. His son Peter 
					represented Tippecanoe county in the Indiana state 
					legislature in 1852. Prior to this, in 1840, the family went 
					to Chillicothe, Mo., but in a short time they returned to 
					Indiana and settled in Boone and Tippecanoe counties, Ind. 
					The aged widow of Thomas Goldsberry died in Tippecanoe 
					county, at which time she had living ten children, 
					fifty-three grandchildren, and five great-grand children. 
					The fifth generation from Thomas Goldsberry and wife are now 
					being reared in Indiana. Thomas Goldsberry, son of above and 
					father of our subject, was born at Harper's Ferry in 1800. 
					He was reared a farmer, and married in Ross county, Ohio, 
					Elizabeth Landsaw, of that county, and to them were born 
					eight children, two of whom died in infancy. The remaining 
					six were William, John, Mary, Sarah, Jacob, Susan. The first 
					three were born in Ohio and the last three in Indiana. Mr. 
					Goldsberry, in 1831, moved to Tippecanoe county, Ind., where 
					Sarah was born, and in the fall of that year he moved to 
					Boone county, and entered 118 acres of land in Sugar Creek 
					and Washington townships. He cleared this and erected a 
					hewed log house, where he died August 4, 1860, at sixty 
					years of age. He was a great hunter and, as deer and wild 
					turkey were plentiful, he abundantly supplied his table. He 
					was a shoemaker by trade, made a good living and was a 
					substantial citizen. He was a democrat, and he and his wife 
					were members of the Methodist church, in which he was a 
					class-leader and steward, and he was always a liberal 
					supporter of his church. The itinerant Methodist preacher of 
					those days made his home at his house. He was held in kindly 
					esteem by all who knew him, and reared a good family. John 
					J. Goldsberry was born in Ross county, Ohio, on his father's 
					farm, February 5, 1827, and was about four years of age when 
					brought to Tippecanoe county, Ind.--Grandfather Goldsberry 
					with a large ox wagon drawn by two yoke of oxen, and his 
					father with an ordinary wagon drawn by two horses. The men 
					and larger boys walked, and the women and small children 
					rode when tired. They camped at night by the roadside, built 
					a brush fire and made coffee, and had a simple meal, 
					sometimes garnished with game--gray squirrel being 
					plentiful. They slept in blankets around the campfires 
					Indian fashion, and in the wagons, and without accident this 
					hardy pioneer family made their way over the rude roads, 
					fording the streams. It was early fall and the forests 
					supplied plenty of mast, which, with the wild pea vine, 
					provided plenty of food for the stock. John J. Goldsberry 
					learned to spell by attending the spelling schools, where 
					the young pioneers strove to spell one another down, and 
					where he became an expert and mastered every word in the 
					spelling book, often being at the head of his class. He 
					learned but little arithmethic,[sic] and not that little 
					until he was twenty-two years of age, when he studied five 
					days, and mastered enough to attend properly to all matters 
					of business in his line. His schoolteacher was Joseph A. 
					Caldwell, an uncle from Virginia, a man of good education. 
					He was at one time commissioner of Boone county, and justice 
					of the peace. He was the only man in his part of Boone 
					county who took a newspaper in 1833, and these newspapers, 
					greased, served as windows in many a log cabin of the 
					pioneer. The young men came to school dressed in buckskins, 
					and on Christmas Day demanded that Mr. Caldwell treat them 
					to whisky, and, to force him to do so, locked him out of the 
					school house. As it was a subscription school and owned by 
					Mr. Caldwell, he promptly sent a young man for an ax, and 
					with the sturdy strokes of a backwoodsman soon cut the door 
					into kindling wood. Many of the young men were full grown, 
					but he ordered them to their seats, and he had no further 
					trouble with them. His newspaper was the old "New York 
					Weekly Herald," and was the wonder of the neighborhood. The 
					pioneers would gather at his home and have him read to them 
					by the light of a hickory bark torch. At the age of fourteen 
					years Mr. Goldsberry began to work out for twelve and 
					one-half cents per day, and when able to do a man's work he 
					received $6 per month, At the age of twenty, his father 
					remarrying, he left home and learned the carpenter's trade, 
					receiving $15 per month and board, which were good wages for 
					an apprentice. At the age of twenty-one he began to work for 
					himself at his trade, when twenty-two years old he began 
					contracting and laid up money, and in 1858 bought forty 
					acres of land in Washington township, Boone county, ten 
					acres of which were in cultivation, for $750. October 15, 
					1859, at the age of thirty-two, he married, in Boone county, 
					Josina Hebb, of Grafton, Va., and to them were born four 
					children: Joseph L., Clement L., Josina and Belle - the 
					three last named all deceased. This wife died seven years 
					after marriage, March 11, 1866, and Mr. Goldsberry married, 
					in Fayette county, Ohio, his present wife, Hannah Maria, 
					daughter of Amos and Ann (Lease) Goldsberry, of the same 
					original stock, but distantly related, the grandfathers of 
					Amos and our subject being third cousins. Mr. and Mrs. 
					Goldsberry have three children living: Anna B., Alma May, 
					and Amos A., all born on the farm in Washington township, 
					Boone county. Mr. Goldsberry added gradually to his farm 
					until he now owns 218 acres of fine land, 200 acres being in 
					cultivation, without any lien on it whatever. It is improved 
					with a substantial residence and farm buildings, and more 
					tile than any farm of its size in his township. In religious 
					opinions, Mr. Goldsberry is very liberal, believing in every 
					man's worshiping God according to the dictates of his own 
					conscience. In political opinions he was a democrat, but is 
					now independent. He has always been a friend of learning and 
					has given all his children good educations. He has held the 
					office of school-director for many years, and built the 
					first brick schoolhouse in Washington township. Mr. 
					Goldsberry is a Mason; a member of Thorntown lodge, No. 114; 
					is also a member of the Farmer's Alliance, of which he was 
					an elector for three years. He was also one of the original 
					grangers of Boone county. Originally he was a stanch 
					democrat and believed in pure democracy as taught on the 
					principles established by Thomas Jefferson. In these later 
					and more degenerate days, "Uncle John" is very liberal in 
					his political views. In 1894 he was foreman of the Boone 
					county grand-jury, which did effective work. Mr. Goldsberry 
					is a man of patient industry. Throughout his long life of 
					sixty-seven years he has been afflicted with a white 
					swelling, from which he has suffered great pain, and which 
					has caused lameness, but his grit and stamina have enabled 
					him to work on his farm, and he has probably done as much 
					work as any other man in Boone county. He stands very high 
					as an honored citizen, and is a man of great intelligence, 
					and a versatile conversationalist. He has been a wide 
					reader, and his active mind is well stored with solid 
					information. He relates in a very interesting way many 
					anecdotes of pioneer life. He is very active in politics and 
					attended all the early conventions. He was a subscriber for 
					the first newspaper published in Boone county, "The 
					Pioneer." Uncle John says that the first church building in 
					his township was a Union meeting house, and his mother wove 
					cloth and sold it to pay for the sash for the windows. We 
					might fill this large volume with "Uncle John's" 
					reminiscences, but want of space forbids.
