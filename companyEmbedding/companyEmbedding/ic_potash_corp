      IC Potash Announces Closing of a Private Placement and Diversification 
      into the Organic Fertilizer Market for Medical Cannabis
    





March 02, 2017 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--IC Potash Corp. (TSX: ICP; OTCQX: ICPTF) (“IC Potash” or 
      the “Company”) is pleased to announce the closing of a 
      non-brokered private placement (the “Private Placement”). An 
      aggregate of 6,573,333 units of the Company (the “Units”) were 
      issued at $0.105 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of $690,200.
    


      Each Unit consists of one common share of the Company (a “Common 
      Share”); and (ii) one-half of one common share purchase warrant (each a 
      “Warrant”). Each full Warrant entitles the holder to acquire one 
      additional Common Share at an exercise price of $0.16 until March 1, 
      2018, provided that if, at any time after the date which is four months 
      and one day following the Closing Date, the volume weighted average 
      price of the Common Shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) 
      equals or exceeds $0.21 for 18 consecutive trading days, the Company may 
      accelerate the expiry date of the Warrants, in which event the Warrants 
      will expire upon the date (the “Accelerated Expiry Date”) which 
      is 30 days following the dissemination of a press release by the Company 
      announcing the Accelerated Expiry Date. The Company paid a finder’s fee 
      of $504 and no broker warrants.
    

      The use of proceeds includes research and development of polyhalite as 
      an organic fertilizer in the medical cannabis cultivation space. The 
      initial focus will be to demonstrate the effectiveness of polyhalite as 
      an organic fertilizer which is not only non-chloride but also provides 
      four macro and secondary nutrients for growing medicinal cannabis.
    

      Mr. Mehdi Azodi, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company 
      stated, “The medical cannabis space is growing rapidly in Canada and 
      internationally. Canada, Netherlands, Australia, Germany, Israel, 
      Uruguay and Colombia have all passed legislation to allow for the 
      cultivation of medical cannabis. The cultivation of the various strains 
      of Cannabis plants in these different jurisdictions requires 
      considerable fertilization by macro and micronutrients. All of the 
      nutrients in polyhalite: Potassium, Magnesium, Calcium and Sulfate, are 
      important nutrients for cannabis cultivation. Further, the cannabis 
      leaves themselves benefit from non-chloride fertilizers and polyhalite 
      is a non-chloride fertilizer. We are pleased to be expanding into this 
      prolific space for future joint venture partners. The fact that 
      polyhalite is an organic fertilizer makes this natural based product 
      favorable to numerous international growers. Potassium takes part in the 
      photosynthesis process, improves the resistance of plants, increases the 
      consistency and strength of the plant, and increases the weight, 
      density, and volume of the buds. Potassium, Sulfate, Calcium, and 
      Magnesium all provide benefits during the vegetative and flowering 
      stages of cannabis cultivation.”
    

      Insiders of the Company subscribed for 637,856 units of the Private 
      Placement, which represents 9.7% of the total placement. The insider 
      private placements are exempt from the valuation and minority 
      shareholder approval requirements of Multilateral Instrument 61-101 (“MI 
      61-101”) by virtue of the exemptions contained in section 5.5(a) and 
      5.7(1) (a) of MI 61-101 in that the fair market value of the 
      consideration for the securities of the Company issued to the insiders 
      did not exceed 25% of its market capitalization.

TORONTO, June  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IC Potash Corp. (TSX:ICP) (OTCQB:ICPTF) ("IC Potash" or the "Company") is extremely pleased to announce that ICP and Intercontinental Potash Corp. (USA) ("ICPUSA") have received a formal offer from the company H20 of Lea County ("H20") to purchase ICPUSA's Capitan Reef Complex Aquifer water.
H20 is committed to building the required infrastructure and providing the equipment costing approximately USD$2M at no cost to ICPUSA. The potential annual revenue for ICPUSA is USD$4M to USD$6M under the proposed offer by H20. 
Mehdi Azodi, President & CEO of IC Potash stated, "We are pleased to receive such a positive proposal for the highly valuable Capitan Reef Complex Aquifer water asset."
H20 will be responsible for identifying, purchasing, and installing the required pumps, treatment facilities, pipelines, electrical power, storage facilities and related infrastructure. The ongoing operations and related monthly cost of electricity, labor, maintenance and process chemicals will be carried out by H20.
Oil producers require 160,000 to 200,000 barrels of water per well to fracture multiple formations. There are multiple wells completed each month in South East New Mexico. H20's expectation is that ICPUSA's water wells, located about 10 miles northeast of the Ochoa Project, drilled and available for pumping and distribution, will provide water for approximately seven fracturing jobs per month.
The proposal has been submitted to the board of ICPUSA and is valid until July 10, 2017.

SOP Grades


SOP Grades.
Sulfate of potash (SOP) is available in three main agricultural grades: standard, granular, and soluble.
Standard SOP is used for direct application on hardy crops and in the manufacturing of compound fertilizers. It contains 50% potassium oxide, 45% sulfur trioxide, and a maximum of 1% chloride. It appears as fine crystals with a typical particle size range of 0.21 mm to 1.68 mm.
Granular SOP is the most important and most widely used grade in the United States and many other parts of the world. This grade is used in bulk blends, for mechanized spreading, and for manual application on crops that have even soil nutrient distribution. It contains 50% potassium oxide, 45% sulfur trioxide, and a maximum of 1% chloride. It appears as small granules with a typical particle size range of 0.84 mm to 3.36 mm. Granular SOP is produced by mechanically compressing the product, and then breaking and screening it to achieve the desired particle size. Granular grade can also be produced by granulating the material and using a binding agent. The price premium for granular SOP is $20 to $30 per tonne.
Soluble SOP is used in open field fertigation, foliar feeding, and greenhouse and hydroponic systems. It contains 52% potassium oxide, 45% sulfur trioxide, and maximum 0.5% chloride. It appears as a fine powder, which dissolves rapidly in water, with a typical particle size range of 0.106 mm to 0.30 mm. This form of SOP holds less than 5% of the SOP market and sells for a substantial premium to the other forms of SOP.

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Water Supply.
A long-term supply of sufficient water is fundamental to the successful development and operation of most mines. For the Ochoa project, IC Potash Corp. is developing a deep, non-potable water supply from the Capitan aquifer.
Supplying the Ochoa project with water from the Capitan aquifer is advantageous for many reasons:

No permit is required because the aquifer meets the basic criteria for mining established by the State of New Mexico
Both Bureau of Land Management and New Mexico Office of the State Engineer are supportive of using deep brackish groundwater for mining
There is a track record in the region for the use of deep brackish groundwater from the Capitan aquifer
There would be no competition for the limited freshwater resources that are essential to the surrounding communities

The Capitan aquifer is composed of the Capitan Formation, parts of the Goat Sheep Formation, and the Artesia Group (all referred to as the Capitan Reef complex). The Capitan Reef complex is a horseshoe-shaped limestone deposit surrounding the Delaware Basin, and is present in southeastern New Mexico and western Texas. The complex extends over a distance of approximately 200 miles. Within Lea County, the aquifer ranges from 800 to 2,200 feet thick and is approximately 12 miles wide near the Eddy County and Lea County boundary and 6 miles wide near Jal, New Mexico.

History of Water Use
Brackish groundwater from the Capitan aquifer has been used historically for secondary oil recovery, thus establishing a precedent for using this resource for industrial purposes. Historical sources discuss a number of brackish groundwater development projects in the Capitan Reef, including the Jal Water Supply system near Jal, New Mexico, and El Capitan Source Water system near Kermit, Texas.
The El Capitan Source Water system was developed in the mid-1960s by Shell Oil for secondary oil recovery. These wells were completed in the Capitan Reef with plans to pump up to 28,000 acre-feet per year. The New Mexico Office of the State Engineer documented water use from this well field in the range of 8,000 acre-feet per year in 1964, expected to be in the range of 13,000 acre-feet per year in 1965. In 1965, the estimated total fluid withdrawals from the Capitan Reef in Texas were in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 acre-feet per year from 1945 to 1965. Thus, there is clear evidence of significant historical usage of brackish water from the Capitan aquifer, indicating a high probability of success for its use as a supply source for Ochoa.

Thus, there is clear evidence of significant historical usage of brackish water from the Capitan aquifer, indicating a high probability of success for its use as a supply source for Ochoa.
 
Well Drilling and Testing
In support of the Feasibility Study, ICP completed and tested two production wells that produce water from the Capitan aquifer. The pumping tests successfully demonstrated the desired pumping capacity of the wells and confirmed the aquifer’s suitability to provide Ochoa with a high-yield, long-term supply of water.

Water Treatment
In March 2013, ICP completed a bench-scale test to evaluate the processing plant’s planned Reverse Osmosis (R/O) system on water drawn from the Capitan aquifer. Using a two-stage R/O process, a 96% reduction in total dissolved solids was achieved, with 92.5% permeate recovery. These results further validated the ability to achieve the 90% permeate recovery process necessary for overall water balance determined in the Feasibility Study.

An aggregate of 16,950,000 units of the Company (the “Units”) were issued for aggregate gross proceeds of $1.356 million.

Each Unit consists of (i) one common share of the Company (a “Common Share”); and (ii) one common share purchase warrant (a “Warrant”).

An aggregate of 16,950,000 Units were issued at $0.08 per Unit. The Company paid finder’s fees to certain qualified eligible persons assisting the Company in the Private Placement in the aggregate amount of $85,860 (equal to 7% of the gross proceeds raised by such finders). The Company also issued an aggregate of 1,071,000 broker warrants (“Broker Warrants”) to qualified eligible persons as is equal to 7% of the aggregate number of Units sold by such finders, each such Broker Warrant entitling the holder to acquire one Common Share for a period of 12 months at an exercise price equal to $0.11. 

“The significant support from long-term shareholders for the development of the Ochoa project has been instrumental”, stated Mehdi Azodi, President & CEO of IC Potash.

Fertilizers.
The global population is expected to reach more than 9 billion by 2050. This rapid expansion places tremendous strain on an already overburdened agricultural industry. To meet this demand, farmers increasingly need to apply more fertilizers to keep pace. This equates to reduced inventories and stronger prices for fertilizers in the near and long term.
Fertilizers are compounds of nutrients given to plants with the intention of promoting growth. The three primary macronutrients are nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Secondary macronutrients include calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and sulfur (S). There are also micronutrients which benefit plant growth, including boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), chloride (Cl), manganese (Ma), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc (Zn). These nutrients, or fertilizers, are applied through the soil for uptake by plant roots or by foliar spraying for uptake through leaves. Fertilizers can be organic (composed of organic matter, i.e. carbon-based), or inorganic (containing simple, inorganic chemicals).
Fertilizer compounds can be naturally-occurring, such as peat or mineral deposits, or manufactured through natural (e.g. composting) or chemical (e.g. Haber-Bosch or Mannheim) processes. Production entails gathering raw materials from nature, treating them to purify or increase their concentration, converting them into plant-available forms, and often combining them into products that contain more than one nutrient.
The global demand for fertilizers has been rebounding since the economic downturn of 2008/2009 and is forecast to reach 191 million tons in 2015/2016, according to the International Fertilizer Industry Association. This would far surpass the previous record high demand of 168 million tons in 2007/2008. In the coming years, the demand for potassium fertilizers, or potash, is forecast to grow much faster (+4.7% per annum) than demand for nitrogen (+1.9% per annum) and phosphorus (+3.1% p.a.) fertilizers.
In 2010, the global fertilizer industry operated at 80% of total capacity, an improvement over 76% in 2009. The International Fertilizer Industry Association estimates global capacity of fertilizers will reach 250 million tons by 2015, with new projects and expansion of existing operations. The organization also forecasts upwards of $80 billion of investment into the fertilizer industry from 2010 to 2015.

IC Potash pursues lawsuit in Colorado to set aside dilutive financing undertaken by Cartesian Capital in an attempt to obtain control of Ochoa Deposit




















July 12, 2017 18:00 ET

 | Source: IC Potash Corp.






TORONTO, July  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IC Potash Corp. (TSX:ICP) (OTCQB:ICPTF) (“IC Potash” or the “Company”) is pursuing a lawsuit in the state of Colorado to unwind a very dilutive financing undertaken by Cartesian Capital (“Cartesian”) which IC Potash believes was done solely in order to gain full control of the Ochoa Deposit at a price significantly below fair market value. The Company believes this matter will come before the Colorado courts within the next month. IC Potash also announces that it was recently served with a lawsuit commenced by Cartesian and two of its Principals, Peter Yu and Paul Hong, on behalf of Cartesian investors in the State of New York. Mehdi Azodi, President of IC Potash said, "Notwithstanding that the lawsuit is frivolous in and of itself, the board of IC Potash believes that commencing the lawsuit in New York rather than Colorado shows a certain desperation and concern on Cartesian's part to distract attention from the Colorado proceedings, which we believe could have a significant deleterious effect on Cartesian and its investors."  The New York lawsuit, which will be vigorously defended by IC Potash, alleges on the most general of grounds and without a great deal of specificity that, among other things, IC Potash withheld certain information from Cartesian and delayed contractual decisions. IC Potash and its board will continue to take all necessary measures to protect its investment in the Ochoa Deposit and to prevent it from being seized at below market prices. About IC Potash Corp. IC Potash has previously demonstrated a method to make Sulfate of Potash (“SOP”) from the Ochoa polyhalite deposit in Southeast New Mexico in which it has an interest and is currently examining ways to become a low-cost fertilizer producer. The current review of the Ochoa project’s existing feasibility study is being extended to determine a viable positive economic path to the production of direct application polyhalite. The Ochoa project has access to excellent local labor resources, low-cost electricity and natural gas, water, rail lines, and the Port of Galveston, Texas. The Ochoa project’s land holdings consist of nearly 90,000 acres of potassium prospecting permits and mining leases issued by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and State of New Mexico.

Introduction


	  IC Potash Corp. has gone through a significant restructuring plan. The Company has revised its 100%-owned Ochoa polyhalite project in southeastern New Mexico, to consider direct application of polyhalite as a crop nutrient product rather than producing Sulphate of Potash (SOP) through a chemical processing plant. The resulting project has a reduced capital cost, a shorter ramp-up time and improved financial metrics. ICP’s focus is to become a low cost producer of polyhalite.
	  
Projects in Hand

Ochoa Polyhalite Project, Eddy and Lea Counties, New Mexico, USA


	  The Ochoa polyhalite project is located in southeastern New Mexico, the commercial hub for US potash production. The region has excellent resource access, including low-cost electricity and natural gas, an approved water source, local trained labor force, rail lines, and the Port of Galveston, Texas.
	  

	  In 2014 ICP announced an independent Feasibility Study report on producing Sulfate of Potash (SOP), and has received a Record of Decision from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) that authorizes construction and operation of the Ochoa mine and processing facilities.

	  On November 9, 2016, ICP announced the results of an independent Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for the Ochoa Project, focused on direct polyhalite application, with a Capex of $368 million, 28% IRR and an NPV of $1,197 million.
	  

	  The significant reduction in Capex and increased IRR is a significant milestone in the development of the Ochoa project as a future polyhalite producer and provides confirmation of the economic viability and robustness of the Project.
	  

	  PEA highlights:
	  


	  IC Potash has revised the project to consider direct application of polyhalite as a crop nutrient product rather than producing sulphate of potash through a chemical processing plant. The resulting project has a reduced capital cost, a shorter ramp-up time and improved financial metrics;
	  

	  Updated mineral resource estimate (measured and indicated) of 330 million tons of high-grade polyhalite (89.3 per cent by weight);
	  

	  A proposed production schedule extracting up to two million tons per annum (Mtpa) of polyhalite for approximately 38 years of steady-state production at an average grade of 90 per cent polyhalite. Initial production is estimated to begin in 2019;
	  

	  Initial capital expenditure of $368-million that includes a 15-per-cent contingency on direct capital items;
	  

	  Estimated initial polyhalite product netback revenue of $162 per short ton sold and a life-of-mine average of $203 per short ton;
	  

	  Total estimated operating costs of $44 per short ton mined, processed and shipped to a local distribution point;
	  

	  An after-tax, all-equity project NPV (net present value) of $1,197-million at an 8-per-cent real discount rate and an IRR (internal rate of return) of 28 per cent, with payback in 2.6 years;
	  

	  IC Potash is contemplating a design, build, operate and maintenance (DBOM) agreement with a contracting firm to expedite the overall project delivery. Negotiations regarding this DBOM agreement are in progress.

IC Potash.
IC Potash Corp. has demonstrated a low cost method to produce potassium sulfate, also known as sulfate of potash or SOP, from its 100%-owned Ochoa polyhalite deposit in southeastern New Mexico. SOP is the preferred potassium fertilizer for high-value crops - fruits, vegetables, coffee beans, nuts, potatoes, tobacco - and also for soils that are salty, sandy, or located in arid regions.
Ochoa land holdings consist of 98,500 acres of federal potassium preference right leases and prospecting permits, as well as State of New Mexico potassium mining leases. The region has excellent resource access, including low-cost electricity and natural gas, an approved water source, local trained labor force, rail lines, and the Port of Galveston, Texas.
ICP has concluded an independent Feasibility Study that recommends the Company move forward to implementation, and has received a Record of Decision from the BLM that authorizes construction and operation of the Ochoa mine and processing facilities.
