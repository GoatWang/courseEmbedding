Management Assessment  Management of Perpetual Trustee
Company Limited (the Company) is responsible for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d)(2)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii) and 1122(d)(3)(iv) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange
Commission as of and for the year ended March 31, 2017. The transactions covered by this report include asset-backed securities transactions listed in Appendix B that are backed by auto finance receivables for which the Company served as issuer
trustee and that were registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (the Platform). Management has determined that all other criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) are not applicable to the
Company because the Company does not perform activities with respect to the Platform relating to those criteria.  The Companys management has
assessed the Companys compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended March 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph
(d) of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, except those criteria listed as Inapplicable Servicing Criteria in Appendix A, as they are inapplicable to the Company based on the activities it performs with respect to the Platform. 
Based on such assessment, management believes that, as of and for the year ended March 31, 2017, the Company has complied in all material respects with the
servicing criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the servicing of the Platform.  KPMG,
an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report with respect to Managements Assessment of compliance with the applicable servicing criteria as of and for the year ended March 31, 2017.

International Swap Dealers Association, Inc.   
MASTER AGREEMENT  dated as of   15 October 2015. 






Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited ABN 11 005 357 522 (Party A)
 
Perpetual Trustee Company Limited ABN 42 000 001 007 in its capacity as trustee of the SMART ABS Series 2015-1US Trust (Party B)

Macquarie Securities Management Pty Limited ABN 26 003 435 443 (the Manager)
 

 have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a Transaction)
that are or will be governed by this Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the Schedule), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a Confirmation) exchanged between the parties confirming those
Transactions.  Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:  
 


1.
 Interpretation  (a)       Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of this Master
Agreement.  (b)       Inconsistency.  In the event of any
inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the
Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction. 
(c)       Single Agreement.  All Transactions are entered into in reliance on
the fact that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this Agreement), and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions. 
 


2.
 Obligations  (a)       General Conditions.  (i)      Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement. 
(ii)     Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in
the place of the account specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other
than by payment), such delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement. 
(iii)    Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1) the
condition precedent that no Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has
occurred or been effectively designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.

(b)       Change of Account. Either party
may change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives
timely notice of a reasonable objection to such change.  (c)       Netting.
If on any date amounts would otherwise be payable:  (i)     in the same
currency; and  (ii)    in respect of the same Transaction, 
by each party to the other, then, on such date, each partys obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically
satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the
larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.  The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the same currency in respect of such Transactions,
regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being
subject to the election, together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not, or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date). This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions
and will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive payments or deliveries. 
(d)      Deduction or Withholding for Tax. 
(i)     Gross-Up. All payments under this
Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in
effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party (X) will: 
(1)    promptly notify the other party (Y) of such requirement; 
(2)    pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including
the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount
has been assessed against Y;  (3)    promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a
certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and  (4)    if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure
that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required
to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for: 
(A)   the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i),
4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or  (B)   the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to
Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered
into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.

(ii)    Liability. If:  
(1)    X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental
revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4); 
(2)    X does not so deduct or withhold; and 
(3)    a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X, 
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay
to X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).
 (e)       Default Interest; Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or
effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay
interest (before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual
payment, at the Default Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant
Transaction, a party defaults in the performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement.
  


3.       Representations
 
Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which a
Transaction is entered into and, in the case of the representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the termination of this Agreement) that:  (a)       Basic Representations.  (i)     Status. It is duly organised and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and, if relevant under such laws,
in good standing;  (ii)    Powers.  It has the power to execute
this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party, to deliver this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement that it is required by this Agreement to deliver and to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and any obligations it has under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and has taken all necessary action to authorise such execution, delivery and performance; 
(iii)   No Violation or Conflict. Such execution, delivery and performance do not violate or
conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets or any contractual restriction binding on or affecting it
or any of its assets;  (iv)   Consents. All governmental and other consents that
are required to have been obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party have been obtained and are in full force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been complied with; and
 (v)    Obligations Binding. Its obligations under this Agreement and any
Credit Support Document to which it is a party constitute its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganisation, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law)).

(b)       Absence of Certain Events. No
Event of Default or Potential Event of Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of its entering into or performing its obligations
under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party. 
(c)       Absence of Litigation. There is not pending or, to its knowledge, threatened
against it or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or official or any arbitrator that is likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability against
it of this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or such Credit Support Document.  (d)       Accuracy of Specified Information. All applicable information that is furnished in writing by or on behalf of it to the other party and is
identified for the purpose of this Section 3(d) in the Schedule is, as of the date of the information, true, accurate and complete in every material respect.  (e)       Payer Tax Representation. Each representation specified in the Schedule as being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(e) is accurate
and true.  (f)       Payee Tax Representations. Each representation specified
in the Schedule as being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(f) is accurate and true.   


4.
 Agreements  Each party agrees with the other that, so long as either party has or may have any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party: 
(a)       Furnish Specified Information. It will deliver to the other party or, in
certain cases under subparagraph (iii) below, to such government or taxing authority as the other party reasonably directs:  (i)      any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation; 
(ii)     any other documents specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation; and 
(iii)    upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document that may be required or
reasonably requested in writing in order to allow such other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under this Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or
with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with any such
form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification, 
in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.
 (b)       Maintain Authorisations. It will use all reasonable efforts to
maintain in full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and will use all reasonable efforts to
obtain any that may become necessary in the future.  (c)       Comply with
Laws. It will comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support
Document to which it is a party.  (d)       Tax Agreement. It will give
notice of any failure of a representation made by it under Section 3(f) to be accurate and true promptly upon learning of such failure.  (e)       Payment of Stamp Tax. Subject to Section 11, it will pay any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon it or in respect of its execution or
performance of this Agreement by a jurisdiction in which it is incorporated,

organised, managed and controlled, or considered to have its seat, or in which a branch or office through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located (Stamp Tax
Jurisdiction) and will indemnify the other party against any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon the other party or in respect of the other partys execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax Jurisdiction which is not
also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the other party.   


5.
 Events of Default and Termination Events  (a)       Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any
Specified Entity of such party of any of the following events constitutes an event of default (an Event of Default) with respect to such party: 
(i)     Failure to Pay or Deliver. Failure by the party to make, when due, any
payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the third Local Business Day after notice of such failure is given to the party; 
(ii)    Breach of Agreement. Failure by the party to comply with or perform any
agreement or obligation (other than an obligation to make any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) or to give notice of a Termination Event or any agreement or obligation under Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii)
or 4(d)) to be complied with or performed by the party in accordance with this Agreement if such failure is not remedied on or before the thirtieth day after notice of such failure is given to the party; 
(iii)   Credit Support Default. 
(1)    Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party to comply with or perform
any agreement or obligation to be complied with or performed by it in accordance with any Credit Support Document if such failure is continuing after any applicable grace period has elapsed; 
(2)    the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document or the failing or ceasing of
such Credit Support Document to be in full force and effect for the purpose of this Agreement (in either case other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the satisfaction of all obligations of such party under each Transaction to which such
Credit Support Document relates without the written consent of the other party; or 
(3)    the party or such Credit Support Provider disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in
whole or in part, or challenges the validity of, such Credit Support Document; 
(iv)    Misrepresentation. A representation (other than a representation under
Section 3(e) or (f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material
respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated; 
(v)    Default under Specified Transaction. The party, any Credit Support Provider of
such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party (1) defaults under a Specified Transaction and, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, there occurs a liquidation of, an acceleration of obligations
under, or an early termination of, that Specified Transaction, (2) defaults, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, in making any payment or delivery due on the last payment, delivery or exchange date of, or
any payment on early termination of, a Specified Transaction (or such default continues for at least three Local Business Days if there is no applicable notice requirement or grace period) or (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in
whole or in part, a Specified Transaction (or such action is taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act on its behalf);  (vi)    Cross Default. If Cross Default is specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default, event of
default or other similar condition or event (however 
 









  
5
  
ISDA®  1992



described) in respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party under one or more agreements or instruments relating to Specified
Indebtedness of any of them (individually or collectively) in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount (as specified in the Schedule) which has resulted in such Specified Indebtedness becoming, or becoming capable at such
time of being declared, due and payable under such agreements or instruments, before it would otherwise have been due and payable or (2) a default by such party, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity (individually or
collectively) in making one or more payments on the due date thereof in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold Amount under such agreements or instruments (after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace
period);  (vii)  Bankruptcy. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or
any applicable Specified Entity of such party:   (1) is dissolved (other than pursuant to a
consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (2) becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due; (3) makes a general assignment, arrangement or
composition with or for the benefit of its creditors; (4) institutes or has instituted against it a proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law
affecting creditors rights, or a petition is presented for its winding-up or liquidation, and, in the case of any such proceeding or petition instituted or presented against it, such proceeding or
petition (A) results in a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or the entry of an order for relief or the making of an order for its winding-up or liquidation or (B) is not dismissed, discharged,
stayed or restrained in each case within 30 days of the institution or presentation thereof; (5) has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant to a
consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks or becomes subject to the appointment of an administrator, provisional liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for all or substantially all its
assets; (7) has a secured party take possession of all or substantially all its assets or has a distress, execution, attachment, sequestration or other legal process levied, enforced or sued on or against all or substantially all its assets and
such secured party maintains possession, or any such process is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained, in each case within 30 days thereafter; (8) causes or is subject to any event with respect to it which, under the applicable laws
of any jurisdiction, has an analogous effect to any of the events specified in clauses (1) to (7) (inclusive); or (9) takes any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the
foregoing acts; or  (viii)  Merger Without Assumption. The party or any Credit Support
Provider of such party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer:  
(1)  the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all the obligations of such party or such
Credit Support Provider under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it or its predecessor was a party by operation of law or pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other party to this Agreement; or 
(2)  the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend (without the consent of the other party) to the
performance by such resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under this Agreement. 
(b)       Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if
applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if the event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in (ii) below
or a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below, and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event

ISDA®  1992



Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional Termination Event if the event is specified pursuant to (v) below: 
(i)     Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable law
after the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any applicable law after such date, it becomes
unlawful (other than as a result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which will be the Affected Party):   (1)    to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other
material provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or  (2)    to perform,
or for any Credit Support Provider of such party to perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction; 
(ii)    Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought
in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a Change in Tax Law, the party (which
will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under
Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest
under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)); 
(iii)   Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the Burdened Party) on the next
succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or
(2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by reason of
Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where
such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii); 
(iv)   Credit Event Upon Merger. If Credit Event Upon Merger is specified in the
Schedule as applying to the party, such party (X), any Credit Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to,
another entity and such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support Provider or such
Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action (and, in such event, X or its successor or transferee, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party); or 
(v)    Additional Termination Event. If any Additional Termination Event is
specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule or such Confirmation).
 (c)       Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or circumstance which
would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event of Default.

6.
 Early Termination  (a)       Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the Defaulting Party) has
occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the Non-defaulting Party) may, by not more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is
effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however, Automatic Early Termination is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding
Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding
the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).
 (b)       Right to Terminate Following Termination Event. 
(i)     Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly
upon becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will also give such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require.
 (ii)    Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under
Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early
Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all
its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist. 
If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within
such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).  Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other
partys policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.  (iii)   Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all reasonable
efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination Event.  (iv)    Right to Terminate. If:   (1)    a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within
30 days after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or  (2)    an
Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party, 
either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party
in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one
Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then

continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions. 
(c)       Effect of Designation. 
(i)    If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or (b), the
Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.  (ii)   Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) in respect of the Terminated
Transactions will be required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be determined pursuant to Section 6(e). 
(d)       Calculations. 
(i)    Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of
an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part, if any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including all relevant
quotations and specifying any amount payable under Section 6(e)) and (2) giving details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained
in determining a Market Quotation, the records of the party obtaining such quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation. 
(ii)    Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any Early
Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default) and on the day which is
two Local Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event). Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent
permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in the Termination Currency, from (and including) the relevant Early Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Applicable Rate. Such
interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. 
(e)       Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the
following provisions shall apply based on the parties election in the Schedule of a payment measure, either Market Quotation or Loss, and a payment method, either the First Method or the Second
Method. If the parties fail to designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed that Market Quotation or the Second Method, as the case may be, shall apply. The amount, if any, payable in
respect of an Early Termination Date and determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.  (i)    Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default:  
(1)    First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and Market Quotation apply, the
Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting
Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid
Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party.  (2)    First Method and Loss. If the First
Method and Loss apply, the Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a positive number, the Non-defaulting Partys Loss in respect of this
Agreement.  (3)    Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and
Market Quotation apply, an amount will be payable equal to (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the 
 









  
9
  
ISDA®  1992



Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Defaulting Party. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party. 
(4)    Second Method and Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an amount will be payable
equal to the Non-defaulting Partys Loss in respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting
Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party. 
(ii)    Termination Events.  If the Early Termination Date results from a
Termination Event:   (1)    One Affected Party. If there is one Affected
Party, the amount payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3), if Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies, except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party and the party which is not the Affected Party, respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated,
Loss shall be calculated in respect of all Terminated Transactions.  (2)    Two
Affected Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:   (A)  if Market
Quotation applies, each party will determine a Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, and an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a) one-half of the difference
between the Settlement Amount of the party with the higher Settlement Amount (X) and the Settlement Amount of the party with the lower Settlement Amount (Y) and (b) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid
Amounts owing to X less (II) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and 
(B)  if Loss applies, each party will determine its Loss in respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all
the Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of the difference between the Loss of the party with the higher Loss
(X) and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss (Y).  If the amount payable is a
positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to Y.  (iii)    Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early Termination Date occurs because Automatic Early Termination applies in respect of a party,
the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to reflect any payments or deliveries made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other
party) during the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii).  (iv)    Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if Market Quotation applies an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable
pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection against future risks and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement neither party will be
entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such losses.

7.
 Transfer  Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the
prior written consent of the other party, except that:   (a)       a party may make
such a transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this
Agreement); and  (b)       a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its
interest in any amount payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).  Any purported transfer that is not in
compliance with this Section will be void.   


8.
 Contractual Currency  (a)       Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that
payment (the Contractual Currency). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than
the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual Currency, of
the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this
Agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount
in the Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of such excess. 
(b)       Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order
expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered (i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this Agreement
or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled
pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund
promptly to the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at
which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the
currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party. The term rate of exchange includes, without limitation, any
premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the Contractual Currency. 
(c)       Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these
indemnities constitute separate and independent obligations from the other obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party to which any
payment is owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this Agreement.  (d)       Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had
an actual exchange or purchase been made.

9.
 Miscellaneous  (a)       Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and
supersedes all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto. 
(b)       Amendments. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this Agreement
will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging system. 
(c)       Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and 6(c)(ii),
the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the termination of any Transaction. 
(d)       Remedies Cumulative. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights, powers,
remedies and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law.  (e)       Counterparts and Confirmations.  (i)  This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in respect of it) may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission), each of which will be
deemed an original.  (ii) The parties intend that they are legally bound by the terms of each Transaction from
the moment they agree to those terms (whether orally or otherwise). A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as practicable and may be executed and delivered in counterparts (including by facsimile transmission) or be created by an exchange of
telexes or by an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system, which in each case will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a binding supplement to this Agreement. The parties will specify therein or through another
effective means that any such counterpart, telex or electronic message constitutes a Confirmation. 
(f)       No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or
privilege in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or
privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. 
(g)       Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this Agreement.   


10.
 Offices; Multibranch Parties  (a)       If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home office
represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking office or jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of such party, the obligations of such party are the same as if it had entered into the Transaction through its head or
home office. This representation will be deemed to be repeated by such party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.  (b)       Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior written
consent of the other party.  (c)       If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in
the Schedule, such Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction
will be specified in the relevant Confirmation.   


11.
 Expenses  A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including legal fees and Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document

to which the Defaulting Party is a party or by reason of the early termination of any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection. 
 


12.
 Notices  (a)      Effectiveness. Any notice or other communication in respect of this Agreement may be given in any manner set forth below (except that a notice or other
communication under Section 5 or 6 may not be given by facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system) to the address or number or in accordance with the electronic messaging system details provided (see the Schedule) and will be deemed
effective as indicated:  (i)    if in writing and delivered in person or by courier,
on the date it is delivered;  (ii)   if sent by telex, on the date the recipients
answerback is received;  (iii)   if sent by facsimile transmission, on the date that
transmission is received by a responsible employee of the recipient in legible form (it being agreed that the burden of proving receipt will be on the sender and will not be met by a transmission report generated by the senders facsimile
machine);  (iv)  if sent by certified or registered mail (airmail, if overseas) or the equivalent
(return receipt requested), on the date that mail is delivered or its delivery is attempted; or 
(v)   if sent by electronic messaging system, on the date that electronic message is received, 
unless the date of that delivery (or attempted delivery) or that receipt, as applicable, is not a Local Business Day or that
communication is delivered (or attempted) or received, as applicable, after the close of business on a Local Business Day, in which case that communication shall be deemed given and effective on the first following day that is a Local Business Day.
 (b)      Change of Addresses. Either party may by notice to the other change the
address, telex or facsimile number or electronic messaging system details at which notices or other communications are to be given to it.   


13.
 Governing Law and Jurisdiction  (a)      Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law specified in the Schedule. 
(b)      Jurisdiction. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to this
Agreement (Proceedings), each party irrevocably:  (i)    submits to the
jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States District
Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of New York; and  (ii)   waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that such Proceedings have been brought in an
inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.  Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (outside, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, the Contracting States, as
defined in Section 1(3) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 or any modification, extension or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force) nor will the bringing of Proceedings in any one
or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction. 
(c)      Service of Process. Each party irrevocably appoints the Process Agent (if any)
specified opposite its name in the Schedule to receive, for it and on its behalf, service of process in any Proceedings. If for any 
 









  
13
  
ISDA®  1992



reason any partys Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable to the other
party. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process given in the manner provided for notices in Section 12. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of either party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
 (d)      Waiver of Immunities. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to itself and its revenues and assets (irrespective of their use or intended use), all immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any
court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets (whether before or after judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its
revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will not claim any such immunity in any Proceedings.

Specified Transaction.  Loss means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated
Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith to be its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection
with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including any loss of bargain, cost of funding or, at the election of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a result
of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them). Loss includes losses and costs (or gains) in respect of any payment or delivery required to have been made
(assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) on or before the relevant Early Termination Date and not made, except, so as to avoid duplication, if Section 6(e)(i)(1) or (3) or 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) applies. Loss does not include
a partys legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11. A party will determine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if
that is not reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable. A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the
relevant markets.  Market Quotation means, with respect to one or more Terminated Transactions and a
party making the determination, an amount determined on the basis of quotations from Reference Market-makers. Each quotation will be for an amount, if any, that would be paid to such party (expressed as a negative number) or by such party (expressed
as a positive number) in consideration of an agreement between such party (taking into account any existing Credit Support Document with respect to the obligations of such party) and the quoting Reference Market-maker to enter into a transaction
(the Replacement Transaction) that would have the effect of preserving for such party the economic equivalent of any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was absolute or contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each
applicable condition precedent) by the parties under Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date, have

 









  
15
  
ISDA®  1992



been required after that date. For this purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any
payment or delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be included. The Replacement Transaction would be
subject to such documentation as such party and the Reference Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The party making the determination (or its agent) will request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably
practicable as of the same day and time (without regard to different time zones) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and time as of which those quotations are to be obtained will be selected in
good faith by the party obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), and, if each party is so obliged, after consultation with the other. If more than three quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the
quotations, without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest values. If exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For this
purpose, if more than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than three quotations are provided, it will be deemed that the Market Quotation in respect of such Terminated
Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions cannot be determined.  Non-default Rate means a rate
per annum equal to the cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to the Non-defaulting Party (as certified by it) if it were to fund the relevant amount. 
Non-defaulting Party has the meaning specified in Section 6(a). 
Office means a branch or office of a party, which may be such partys head or home office. 
Potential Event of Default means any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would
constitute an Event of Default.  Reference Market-makers means four leading dealers in the relevant
market selected by the party determining a Market Quotation in good faith (a) from among dealers of the highest credit standing which satisfy all the criteria that such party applies generally at the time in deciding whether to offer or to make
an extension of credit and (b) to the extent practicable, from among such dealers having an office in the same city. 
Relevant Jurisdiction means, with respect to a party, the jurisdictions (a) in which the party is
incorporated, organised, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat, (b) where an Office through which the party is acting for purposes of this Agreement is located, (c) in which the party executes this Agreement and (d) in
relation to any payment, from or through which such payment is made.  Scheduled Payment Date means a
date on which a payment or delivery is to be made under Section 2(a)(i) with respect to a Transaction. 
Set-off means set-off, offset, combination of accounts, right of
retention or withholding or similar right or requirement to which the payer of an amount under Section 6 is entitled or subject (whether arising under this Agreement, another contract, applicable law or otherwise) that is exercised by, or
imposed on, such payer.  Settlement Amount means, with respect to a party and any Early Termination
Date, the sum of:   (a)     the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Market Quotations
(whether positive or negative) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions for which a Market Quotation is determined; and  (b)     such partys Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to any Unpaid Amounts) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions for
which a Market Quotation cannot be determined or would not (in the reasonable belief of the party making the determination) produce a commercially reasonable result.  Specified Entity has the meanings specified in the Schedule.

Specified Indebtedness means, subject to the Schedule, any

value of that which was (or would have been) required to be delivered as of the originally scheduled date for delivery, in each case together with (to the extent permitted under applicable law)
interest, in the currency of such amounts, from (and including) the date such amounts or obligations were or would have been required to have been paid or performed to (but excluding) such Early Termination Date, at the Applicable Rate. Such amounts
of interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. The fair market value of any obligation referred to in clause (b) above shall be reasonably determined by the party obliged to make the

 No breach. To the best of its knowledge, it is not in breach of any material provisions of the Master Trust Deed or the Transaction Documents
of the Series Trust.

Prospectus (each a Relevant Date), and has not been in the twelve months preceding each Relevant Date, involved in any legal or arbitration proceedings that Party A reasonably expects would be likely to have, or that have had, a
significant effect on its financial position that in the opinion of Party A require disclosure by it under a disclosure obligation of any securities exchange on which its securities are listed (Significant Proceedings and
Relevant Securities Exchange, respectively) and (ii) nor, so far as Party A is aware as at the Relevant Date, are any Significant Proceedings pending or threatened, except, in the case of each of (i) and (ii), any legal
or arbitration proceedings as it may have previously disclosed to Party B.

of the date of the Preliminary Prospectus, the date of the Final Prospectus or the date such Swap Financial Disclosure is provided, as applicable; provided further that Party A acknowledges that if Party A subsequently revises, amends
or restates any Swap Financial Disclosure previously provided to Party B or the Manager, Party A shall provide such revised, amended or restated Swap Financial Disclosure to Party B and the Manager within four (4) Local Business Days..

Trust, as a result of Party Bs fraud, negligence or wilful default.

 (Acts or omissions): It is acknowledged that the Relevant Parties are responsible under the Transaction Documents for performing a variety of

Transaction Document (other than a person whose acts or omissions Party B is liable for in accordance with any such Transaction Document) to fulfil its obligations relating to the Series Trust or by any other act or omission of such Relevant Party
or any other such person.   


 
(e)
 (No Authority): No attorney, agent, receiver or receiver and manager appointed in accordance with the Transaction Documents has authority to
act on behalf of Party B in a way which exposes Party B to any personal liability and no act or omission of any such person will be considered fraud, negligence or wilful default of the Party B for the purposes of Section 15(c).
  


 
(f)

Section 17(b)(ii), Party A must also take one of the actions referred to in Section 17(b)(iii) as soon as is reasonably practicable using commercially reasonable efforts to do so following the occurrence of the Subsequent Moodys
Rating Event.   


 
(d)
 (Close-Out Calculations): If an Early Termination Date is designated at a time when Party A is the Affected Party in respect of an Additional
Termination Event or the Defaulting Party in respect of any Event of Default, paragraphs (i) to (v) below shall apply:   


 
(i)
 The following definition of Market Quotation shall apply: 
Market Quotation means, with respect to one or more Terminated Transactions, a Firm Offer which
is:   


 
(A)
 made by a Reference Market-maker that is a Moodys Eligible Replacement; 
 


 
(B)
 for an amount that would be paid to Party B (expressed as a negative number) or by Party B (expressed as a positive number) in consideration of an
agreement between Party B and such Reference Market-maker that is a Moodys Eligible Replacement to enter into a transaction (the Replacement Transaction) that would have the effect of preserving for Party B the economic
equivalent of any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was absolute or contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) by the parties under this Agreement in respect of such Terminated Transactions
or group of Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required after that Early Termination Date; 
 


 
(C)
 made on the basis that Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be excluded but, without
limitation, any payment or delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be included; and
  


 
(D)
 made in respect of a Replacement Transaction with terms that are, in all material respects, no less beneficial for Party B than those of this
Agreement (save for the exclusion of provisions relating to Transactions that are not Terminated Transactions), as determined by Party B (at the direction of the Manager). 
  44 




 
(ii)
 In determining whether or not a Firm Offer satisfies the condition in sub-paragraph (D) of Market Quotation, the Manager (in directing Party B)
and Party B (acting at the direction of the Manager) shall act in a commercially reasonable manner.   


 
(iii)
 The definition of Settlement Amount shall be replaced with the following:

(B)
 if, on such Early Termination Date, the Manager has not directed Party B to accept a Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or
group of Terminated Transactions so as to become legally binding and one or more Market Quotations have been communicated to the Manager and Party B and remain capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by Party B, the Termination Currency
Equivalent of the amount (whether positive or negative) of the lowest of such Market Quotations, and for the avoidance of doubt:   


 
(i)
 a Market Quotation expressed as a negative number is lower than a Market Quotation expressed as a positive number; and 
 


 
(ii)
 the lower of two Market Quotations expressed as negative numbers is the one with the largest absolute value; or 
 


 
(C)
 if, on such Early Termination Date, the Manager has not directed Party B to accept a Market Quotation for the relevant Terminated Transaction or
group of Terminated Transactions so as to become legally binding and no Market Quotations have been communicated to the Manager and Party B and remain capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance by Party B, Party Bs Loss (whether
positive or negative and without reference to any Unpaid Amounts) for the relevant Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions.   


 
(iv)
 At any time on or before the Early Termination Date at which two or more Market Quotations have been communicated to Party B and remain capable of
becoming legally binding upon acceptance by Party B, Party B shall be entitled (at the direction of the Manager) to accept only the lowest of such Market Quotations, and for the avoidance of doubt: 
  45 




 
(A)
 a Market Quotation expressed as a negative number is lower than a Market Quotation expressed as a positive number; and

Moodys Second Trigger Required Ratings for a continuous period of 30 Local Business Days or more; and   


 
(ii)
 Party A has not procured an Eligible Guarantee by a guarantor with counterparty risk assessments or credit ratings, as applicable, higher than or
equal to Moodys Second Trigger Required Ratings or a transfer in accordance with Section 17(b)(iii)(A) above; and   


 
(iii)
 at least one Moodys Eligible Replacement has made a Firm Offer that would, assuming the occurrence of an Additional Termination Event, qualify
as a Market Quotation (on the basis that Section 17(d)(i) and Section 17(d)(ii) of the Schedule apply) and which remains capable of becoming legally binding upon acceptance. 
For the purposes of any Additional Termination Event occurring under this Section 17(e), Party A is the sole
Affected Party and all Transactions are Affected Transactions..   


(22)
 Provisions common to a downgrade by a Rating Agency: Insert a new Section 18 of this Agreement immediately after Section 17 as
follows:   


 
18
 Common downgrade provisions   


 
(a)
 (Establishment and maintenance of Collateral Account): Where Party B has not established the Collateral Account for the Series Trust and
Party A elects or is required to deliver collateral to Party B in accordance with the Credit Support Annex, the Manager must direct Party B to establish, as soon as is practicable, and maintain, in the name of Party B, an interest bearing account
with an Eligible Bank which must be an account separate from the Collections Account for the Series Trust (Collateral Account). If Party B becomes aware that the Collateral Account for the Series Trust is held with an entity
which is not an Eligible Bank, Party B must promptly establish a new interest bearing account with an Eligible Bank and transfer the balance of the former Collateral Account for the Series Trust to the new Collateral Account for the Series
Trust within 30 days.   


 
(b)
 (Collateral transferred into Collateral Account): Any cash collateral delivered by Party A to Party B in accordance with the Credit Support
Annex in compliance with its obligations under Section 16 or Section 17 and any cash proceeds (from disposal or otherwise) from any securities delivered by 
  46 




 
 
Party A to Party B in accordance with the Credit Support Annex in compliance with its obligations under Section 16 or Section 17 (such cash, Cash Collateral) must be
deposited into the Collateral Account and such Cash Collateral will not be subject to or applied according to the Series Supplement in respect of the Series Trust. No money must be paid into the Collateral Account other than Cash Collateral and
interest payable on the money credited to the Collateral Account.   


 
(c)
 (Application of Collateral): Party B may only make withdrawals from any Collateral Account if directed to do so by the Manager and then only
for the purpose of:   


 
(i)
 delivering to Party A Return Amounts, Interest Amounts or Equivalent Distributions in accordance with a Credit Support Annex;
  


 
(ii)
 withdrawing any amount which has been incorrectly deposited into the Collateral Account (and the Manager agrees to direct Party B to refund or pay
to Party A, and Party B agrees promptly to refund or pay to Party A, any such incorrectly deposited amount);   


 
(iii)
 paying bank accounts debit tax or any other similar Tax payable in respect of the Cash Collateral; or 
 


 
(iv)
 paying any amount due to be paid by Party A under this Agreement if Party A has not paid such amount when required (after taking into account any
applicable grace period).  The parties acknowledge and agree that clause 5 of the General
Security Deed applies to the Collateral Account.  Any amount withdrawn from the Collateral Account and
applied in accordance with Section 18(c)(iii) or Section 18(c)(iv) above will (despite any inconsistency with the Credit Support Annex) be taken to reduce (by an amount equal to that amount withdrawn and applied) the Credit Support Balance
under the Credit Support Annex. Any such reduction shall be allocated pro-rata between the Credit Support Balance under each of the Fitch Credit Support Annex and the Moodys Credit Support Annex (as applicable). 
 


 
(d)
 (Novation): If Party A arranges for the novation of all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement: 
 


 
(i)
 to a Fitch Eligible Replacement pursuant to Section 16(a)(iii)(A) or Section 16(b)(ii)(A) above; or 
 


 
(ii)
 to a Moodys Eligible Replacement pursuant to Section 17(a)(iii)(A) or Section 17(b)(iii)(A) above, 
Party B (at the direction of the Manager) and the Manager will do all things necessary, at the cost of Party A, to
effect such novation.   


 
(e)
 Multiple Credit Support Annexes   


 
(i)
 The parties agree that each Credit Support Annex: 
 


 
(A)
 forms part of this Schedule, the Master Agreement and this Agreement; and 
  47 




 
(B)
 constitutes a separate Transaction under this Agreement. 
 


 
(ii)
 Accordingly, separate calculations, payments and deliveries are to be made in respect of each Credit Support Annex. However, in order to avoid
possible duplication of obligations to deliver credit support, the parties agree that any Delivery Amount or any Return Amount in respect of a Valuation Date calculated under a Credit Support Annex will take into account the following:
  


 
(A)
 the Value of the Transferors Credit Support Balance is to include the Value of Other Eligible Credit Support as of that Valuation Date
provided that the maximum Return Amount which may be calculated under that Credit Support Annex on that Valuation Date is equal to the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferors Credit Support Balance (without including
the Value of any Other Eligible Credit Support); and   


 
(B)
 the Value of the Transferors Credit Support Balance is to be adjusted to include any Delivery Amount and to deduct any Return Amount:
  


 
(1)
 which has been calculated under any other Credit Support Annex or which is to be calculated under any other Credit Support Annex on such Valuation
Date; and   


 
(2)
 the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date,
 but only to the extent of the Value (if any) which would be calculated under
that Credit Support Annex for the Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support constituting that Delivery Amount or Return Amount.   


 
(iii)
 Party A will not be required to transfer more Eligible Credit Support than the greatest amount calculated in accordance each Credit Support Annex.
  


 
(iv)
 Other Eligible Credit Support means, in respect of a Credit Support Annex, any credit support which would satisfy the description
of Eligible Credit Support under that Credit Support Annex and which is comprised in the Credit Support Balance under any other Credit Support Annex.   


 
(v)
 The Value of any Other Eligible Credit Support in respect of a Credit Support Annex will be calculated in accordance with the
provisions of that Credit Support Annex (subject to paragraph (vi) below), and not the Credit Support Annex under which the Other Eligible Credit Support has been provided. 
 


 
(vi)
 The parties agree that if a date is a Valuation Date under more than one Credit Support Annex then the calculations of Delivery Amounts and Return
Amounts under each such Credit Support Annex are to be made consecutively with Party A selecting under which Credit 
  48 




 
 
Support Annex the calculations are to be made first (so that the calculations under the second Credit Support Annex will take into account the result of the calculations made under the first
Credit Support Annex). However, the calculations of Delivery Amounts and Return Amounts under a Credit Support Annex having a zero Credit Support Amount must be made before calculations under any other Credit Support Annex..
  


(23)
 Amendment to this Agreement:    


 
(a)
 The Manager must give 5 Business Days notice in writing to each Rating Agency of any amendments to this Agreement.
  


 
(b)
 This Agreement may be amended only by written agreement between all parties to this Agreement, provided that the Manager and Party B may only agree
to such amendment in accordance with the provisions of clause 25 of the Master Trust Deed and for this purpose references in that clause to a Series Supplement will be taken to be references to this Agreement. 
 


(24)
 Appointment of Manager: Party B hereby exclusively appoints the Manager as its attorney to act on Party Bs behalf and exercise all
rights and powers of Party B with respect to this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Manager may issue and receive on behalf of Party B all notices, certificates and other communications to or by Party A under this
Agreement until such time as Party B serves written notice on Party A of the revocation of the Managers authority to act on behalf of Party B in accordance with this Part 5(24). The Manager hereby accepts such appointment. Party A is not
obliged to enquire into the authority of the Manager to exercise or satisfy any of Party Bs rights or obligations on Party Bs behalf. 
 


(25)
 Hedge Agreement and Prepayment: The parties acknowledge and agree for the purposes of: 
 


 
(a)
 the Transaction Documents, this Agreement is a Currency Swap Agreement and a Support Facility and Party A is a Currency Swap Provider for the
purposes of the Security Trust Deed and the General Security Deed; and   


 
(b)
 the Master Trust Deed, this Agreement is a Hedge Agreement. 
 


(26)
 No Amendment: Each of Party B and the Manager agrees that it will not consent to any amendment to any provision in any Transaction Document
dealing with the ranking, priority or entitlement of Party A in respect of any security or moneys relating to the Series Trust without the prior written consent of Party A. 
 


(27)
 Manager as Party: For the purposes of Sections 2, 5, 6 and 10 the Manager is not a party. 
 


(28)
 Anti-money laundering: Each party (the Information Provider) agrees to provide any information and documents reasonably
required by any other party (the Information Recipient) to comply with any applicable anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism financing laws including, without limitation, any applicable laws imposing know your
customer or other identification checks or procedures that the Information Recipient is required to comply with in respect of this Agreement (AML/CTF Laws), but the foregoing obligation applies only to the extent that such
information and such documents are in the possession of the Information Provider or may be obtained by it after having undertaken reasonable steps and subject to any confidentiality, privacy or general law obligations owed by the Information
Provider to any person in relation to whom the information or documents requested relate (except, in all cases, to the extent that the foregoing may be overridden by the relevant AML/CTF Laws). Each party must comply with any AML/CTF Laws applicable
to it, to the extent required to comply with its obligations under the Transaction Documents. Any  
  49 




 
 
party may decline to perform any obligation under the Transaction Documents to the extent it forms the view, in its reasonable opinion, that notwithstanding that it has taken all action to comply
with any applicable AML/CTF Laws, it is required to decline to perform those obligations under any such AML/CTF Laws. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each party and the Noteholders and Unitholders releases each other party (a
Released Party) from any confidentiality, privacy or general law obligations that a Released Party would otherwise owe to it in respect of this Agreement and to the extent to which it is able, any applicable confidentiality and
privacy laws, but only to the extent that the existence of these obligations or laws would otherwise prevent a Released Party from providing any information or documents requested in accordance with this clause or any similar clause in any other
Transaction Document.   


(29)

 Party A acknowledges that for so long as Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited is required to file Exchange Act Reports, Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited is

required to be included or incorporated by reference in such Exchange Act Reports.   


 
(c)

agents of each of the foregoing and each person, if any, who controls Party B, the Manager or Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the
Party A Indemnified Persons) and shall hold each of them harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including legal fees and reasonable expenses) to which any of them may become subject,
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: 
 


 
(i)

the Code, or any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the implementation of such Sections of the Code (a FATCA Withholding Tax).

(33)
 Party A may act as market maker: Party B acknowledges and agrees that Party A and/or its affiliates may from time to time take proprietary
positions, make a market or undertake proprietary activities (including hedging transactions) related to the initiation or termination of a Transaction. This may affect the market price, rate or other market factor(s) underlying a Transaction and

Limit to Rights
 
 If the A$ Floating Payment in relation to a Distribution Date will be less than the Monthly Floating Amount payable by Party B to Party
A on that Distribution Date (including, in each case, any A$ Unpaid Floating Amount), Party A may, in its absolute discretion, elect, by notice in writing to Party B and the Manager (such notice to be received by both such parties prior to that
Distribution Date), to pay to Party B on that Distribution Date (in return for payment by Party B of the A$ Floating Payment in relation to that Distribution Date and in lieu of the Monthly Floating Amounts that would otherwise be payable by Party B
to Party A on that Distribution Date) a proportion of the Monthly Floating Amounts that would otherwise be payable by Party A to Party B on that Distribution Date (including any Unpaid Floating Amounts) being the same proportion as the

 This Annex supplements, forms part of, and is subject to, the ISDA Master Agreement referred to above and
is part of its Schedule. For the purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 1(c), 2(a), 5 and 6, the credit support arrangements set out in this Annex constitute a Transaction (for which this Annex constitutes the
Confirmation).  Paragraph 1. Interpretation  Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in this Annex or elsewhere in this Agreement have the meanings specified pursuant to Paragraph 10, and all references in this Annex to Paragraphs are to Paragraphs
of this Annex. In the event of any inconsistency between this Annex and the other provisions of this Schedule, this Annex will prevail, and in the event of any inconsistency between Paragraph 11 and the other 
    1    This document is not intended to create a charge or other security interest over the assets transferred
under its terms. Persons intending to establish a collateral arrangement based on the creation of a charge or other security interest should consider using the ISDA Credit Support Deed (English law) or the ISDA Credit Support Annex (New York law),
as appropriate.  2    This
Credit Support Annex has been prepared for use with ISDA Master Agreements subject to English law. Users should consult their legal advisers as to the proper use and effect of this form and the arrangements it contemplates. In particular, users
should consult their legal advisers if they wish to have the Credit Support Annex made subject to a governing law other than English law or to have the Credit Support Annex subject to a different governing law than that governing the rest of the
ISDA Master Agreement (e.g., English law for the Credit Support Annex and New York law for the rest of the ISDA Master Agreement).  Copyright © 1995 by International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. 


provisions of this Annex, Paragraph 11 will prevail. For the avoidance of doubt, references
to transfer in this Annex mean, in relation to cash, payment and, in relation to other assets, delivery. 
Paragraph 2. Credit Support Obligations  (a)        Delivery Amount. Subject to Paragraphs 3 and 4, upon a demand made by the Transferee on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the
Delivery Amount for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Transferors Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Transferor will transfer to the Transferee Eligible Credit Support having a Value as of the date of transfer at least equal to the
applicable Delivery Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 11(b)(iii)(D)). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(b), the Delivery Amount applicable to the Transferor for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which: 
(i)       the Credit Support Amount 
exceeds  (ii)      the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferors Credit Support Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any prior Return
Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date).  (b)        Return Amount.    Subject to Paragraphs 3 and 4, upon a demand made by the Transferor on or promptly following a
Valuation Date, if the Return Amount for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Transferees Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor Equivalent Credit Support specified by the Transferor in that demand
having a Value as of the date of transfer as close as practicable to the applicable Return Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 11(b)(iii)(D)) and the Credit Support Balance will, upon such transfer, be reduced accordingly. Unless otherwise
specified in Paragraph 11(b), the Return Amount applicable to the Transferee for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which:  (i)       the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferors Credit Support Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any prior
Return Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date) 
exceeds  (ii)      the Credit Support Amount. 
Paragraph 3. Transfers, Calculations and Exchanges  (a)        Transfers.      All transfers under this Annex of any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support,
Interest Amount or Equivalent Distributions shall be made in accordance with the instructions of the Transferee or Transferor, as applicable, and shall be made: 
(i)       in the case of cash, by transfer into one or more bank accounts specified by
the recipient;

(ii)       in the case of certificated
securities which cannot or which the parties have agreed will not be delivered by book-entry, by delivery in appropriate physical form to the recipient or its account accompanied by any duly executed instruments of transfer, transfer tax stamps and
any other documents necessary to constitute a legally valid transfer of the transferring partys legal and beneficial title to the recipient; and  (iii)      in the case of securities which the parties have agreed will be delivered by book-entry, by the giving of written instructions (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, instructions given by telex, facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system) to the relevant depository institution or other entity specified by the recipient, together with a written copy of the instructions to the recipient,
sufficient, if complied with, to result in a legally effective transfer of the transferring partys legal and beneficial title to the recipient.  Subject to Paragraph 4 and unless otherwise specified, if a demand for the transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support is received by the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer
will be made not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day relating to the date such demand is received; if a demand is received after the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer will be made not later than the close of business
on the Settlement Day relating to the day after the date such demand is received. 
(b)        Calculations. All calculations of Value and Exposure for purposes of
Paragraphs 2 and 4(a) will be made by the relevant Valuation Agent as of the relevant Valuation Time. The Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) of its calculations not later than the
Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the applicable Valuation Date (or, in the case of Paragraph 4(a), following the date of calculation).  (c)        Exchanges.  (i)       Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11, the Transferor may on any Local Business Day by notice inform the Transferee that it wishes to transfer to the
Transferee Eligible Credit Support specified in that notice (the New Credit Support) in exchange for certain Eligible Credit Support (the Original Credit Support) specified in that notice comprised in the Transferors
Credit Support Balance.  (ii)      If the Transferee notifies the Transferor
that it has consented to the proposed exchange, (A) the Transferor will be obliged to transfer the New Credit Support to the Transferee on the first Settlement Day following the date on which it receives notice (which may be oral telephonic
notice) from the Transferee of its consent and (B) the Transferee will be obliged to transfer to the Transferor Equivalent Credit Support in respect of the Original Credit Support not later than the Settlement Day following the date on which
the Transferee receives the New Credit Support, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(d) (the Exchange Date); provided that the Transferee will only be obliged to transfer Equivalent Credit Support with a Value as of the date
of transfer as close as practicable to, but in any event not more than, the Value of the New Credit Support as of that date.

Paragraph 4. Dispute Resolution 
(a)        Disputed Calculations or Valuations. If a party (a Disputing
Party) reasonably disputes (I) the Valuation Agents calculation of a Delivery Amount or a Return Amount or (II) the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support, then: 
(1)        the Disputing Party will notify the other party and the Valuation
Agent (if the Valuation Agent is not the other party) not later than the close of business on the Local Business Day following, in the case of (I) above, the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2 or, in the case of (II) above, the
date of transfer;  (2)        in the case of (I) above, the
appropriate party will transfer the undisputed amount to the other party not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day following the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2; 
(3)        the parties will consult with each other in an attempt to resolve the
dispute; and  (4)        if they fail to resolve the dispute by the
Resolution Time, then:  (i)            in the
case of a dispute involving a Delivery Amount or Return Amount, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(c), the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Exposure and the Value as of the Recalculation Date by: 
(A)       utilising any calculations of that part of the Exposure attributable to the
Transactions that the parties have agreed are not in dispute; 
(B)       calculating that part of the Exposure attributable to the Transactions in
dispute by seeking four actual quotations at mid-market from Reference Market-makers for purposes of calculating Market Quotation, and taking the arithmetic average of those obtained; provided that if
four quotations are not available for a particular Transaction, then fewer than four quotations may be used for that Transaction, and if no quotations are available for a particular Transaction, then the Valuation Agents original calculations
will be used for the Transaction; and  (C)       utilising the procedures
specified in Paragraph 11(e)(ii) for calculating the Value, if disputed, of the outstanding Credit Support Balance;  (ii)    in the case of a dispute involving the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support, the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Value as of the
date of transfer pursuant to Paragraph 11(e)(ii).  Following a recalculation pursuant to this Paragraph, the Valuation Agent
will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) as soon as possible but in any event not later than the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the Resolution Time. The appropriate party will, upon demand
following such notice given by the Valuation Agent or a resolution pursuant to (3) above and subject to Paragraph 3(a), make the appropriate transfer.

ISDA ® 1995


(b)          No Event of
Default.   The failure by a party to make a transfer of any amount which is the subject of a dispute to which Paragraph 4(a) applies will not constitute an Event of Default for as long as the procedures set out in this
Paragraph 4 are being carried out. For the avoidance of doubt, upon completion of those procedures, Section 5(a)(i) of this Agreement will apply to any failure by a party to make a transfer required under the final sentence of Paragraph 4(a) on
the relevant due date.  Paragraph 5. Transfer of Title, No Security Interest, Distributions and Interest Amount 
(a)             Transfer of
Title.    Each party agrees that all right, title and interest in and to any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount which it transfers to the other party under the
terms of this Annex shall vest in the recipient free and clear of any liens, claims, charges or encumbrances or any other interest of the transferring party or of any third person (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant
clearance system).  (b)          No Security
Interest.   Nothing in this Annex is intended to create or does create in favour of either party any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge, encumbrance or other security interest in any cash or other property transferred by one party
to the other party under the terms of this Annex.  (c)        Distributions and
Interest Amount. 
(i)       Distributions.   The Transferee will transfer
to the Transferor not later than the Settlement Day following each Distributions Date cash, securities or other property of the same type, nominal value, description and amount as the relevant Distributions (Equivalent Distributions) to
the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose). 
(ii)       Interest Amount.   Unless otherwise specified
in Paragraph 11(f)(iii), the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor at the times specified in Paragraph 11(f)(ii) the relevant Interest Amount to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated
by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose).  Paragraph 6. Default
 If an Early Termination Date is designated or deemed to occur as a result of an Event of Default in relation to a party,
an amount equal to the Value of the Credit Support Balance, determined as though the Early Termination Date were a Valuation Date, will be deemed to be an Unpaid Amount due to the Transferor (which may or may not be the Defaulting Party) for
purposes of Section 6(e). For the avoidance of doubt, if Market Quotation is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Market Quotation determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction
constituted by this Annex will be deemed to be zero, and, if Loss is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Loss determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction will be limited to the Unpaid
Amount representing the Value of the Credit Support Balance.

Paragraph 7. Representation  Each party represents to the other party (which representation will be deemed to be repeated as of each date on which it transfers Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent
Distributions) that it is the sole owner of or otherwise has the right to transfer all Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent Distributions it transfers to the other party under this Annex, free and clear of any security
interest, lien, encumbrance or other restriction (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system). 
Paragraph 8. Expenses 
Each party will pay its own costs and expenses (including any stamp, transfer or similar transaction tax or duty payable on any transfer
it is required to make under this Annex) in connection with performing its obligations under this Annex, and neither party will be liable for any such costs and expenses incurred by the other party. 
Paragraph 9. Miscellaneous  (a)         Default Interest.     Other than in the case of an amount which is the subject of a dispute under
Paragraph 4(a), if a Transferee fails to make, when due, any transfer of Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or the Interest Amount, it will be obliged to pay the Transferor (to the extent permitted under applicable law) an amount
equal to interest at the Default Rate multiplied by the Value on the relevant Valuation Date of the items of property that were required to be transferred, from (and including) the date that the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or
Interest Amount were required to be transferred to (but excluding) the date of transfer of the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount. This interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual
number of days elapsed.  (b)         Good Faith and Commercially Reasonable
Manner.      Performance of all obligations under this Annex, including, but not limited to, all calculations, valuations and determinations made by either party, will be made in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner.  (c)         Demands and
Notices.      All demands and notices given by a party under this Annex will be given as specified in Section 12 of this Agreement.  (d)         Specifications of Certain Matters.       Anything referred to in this Annex as being specified in
Paragraph 11 also may be specified in one or more Confirmations or other documents and this Annex will be construed accordingly.  Paragraph
10. Definitions  As used in this Annex:  Base Currency means the currency specified as such in Paragraph 11(a)(i).

Paragraph 11(b), the Return Amount applicable to the Transferee for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which:  (i)        the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferors Credit Support Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any
prior Return Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date)  exceeds  (ii)        the Credit Support
Amount.  Paragraph 3. Transfers, Calculations and Exchanges

Paragraph 4. Dispute Resolution 
(a)        Disputed Calculations or Valuations. If a party (a Disputing
Party) reasonably disputes (I) the Valuation Agents calculation of a Delivery Amount or a Return Amount or (II) the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support, then: 
(1)        the Disputing Party will notify the other party and the Valuation
Agent (if the Valuation Agent is not the other party) not later than the close of business on the Local Business Day following, in the case of (I) above, the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2 or, in the case of (II) above, the
date of transfer;  (2)        in the case of (I) above, the
appropriate party will transfer the undisputed amount to the other party not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day following the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2; 
(3)        the parties will consult with each other in an attempt to resolve the
dispute; and  (4)        if they fail to resolve the dispute by the
Resolution Time, then:  (i)            in the
case of a dispute involving a Delivery Amount or Return Amount, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(c), the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Exposure and the Value as of the Recalculation Date by: 
(A)       utilising any calculations of that part of the Exposure attributable to the
Transactions that the parties have agreed are not in dispute; 
(B)       calculating that part of the Exposure attributable to the Transactions in
dispute by seeking four actual quotations at mid-market from Reference Market-makers for purposes of calculating Market Quotation, and taking the arithmetic average of those obtained; provided that if
four quotations are not available for a particular Transaction, then fewer than four quotations may be used for that Transaction, and if no quotations are available for a particular Transaction, then the Valuation Agents original calculations
will be used for the Transaction; and  (C)       utilising the procedures
specified in Paragraph 11(e)(ii) for calculating the Value, if disputed, of the outstanding Credit Support Balance;  (ii)     in the case of a dispute involving the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support, the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Value as of
the date of transfer pursuant to Paragraph 11(e)(ii).  Following a recalculation pursuant to this Paragraph, the Valuation
Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) as soon as possible but in any event not later than the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the Resolution Time. The appropriate party will, upon
demand following such notice given by the Valuation Agent or a resolution pursuant to (3) above and subject to Paragraph 3(a), make the appropriate transfer.

(b)        No Event of
Default.  The failure by a party to make a transfer of any amount which is the subject of a dispute to which Paragraph 4(a) applies will not constitute an Event of Default for as long as the procedures set out in this Paragraph 4
are being carried out. For the avoidance of doubt, upon completion of those procedures, Section 5(a)(i) of this Agreement will apply to any failure by a party to make a transfer required under the final sentence of Paragraph 4(a) on the
relevant due date.  Paragraph 5. Transfer of Title, No Security Interest, Distributions and Interest Amount 
(a)        Transfer of Title.    Each party agrees that all
right, title and interest in and to any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount which it transfers to the other party under the terms of this Annex shall vest in the recipient free and clear of
any liens, claims, charges or encumbrances or any other interest of the transferring party or of any third person (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system). 
(b)        No Security Interest.  Nothing in this Annex is intended to
create or does create in favour of either party any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge, encumbrance or other security interest in any cash or other property transferred by one party to the other party under the terms of this Annex. 
(c)        Distributions and Interest Amount. 
(i)       Distributions.  The Transferee will transfer to the
Transferor not later than the Settlement Day following each Distributions Date cash, securities or other property of the same type, nominal value, description and amount as the relevant Distributions (Equivalent Distributions) to the
extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose). 
 
(ii)       Interest Amount.  Unless otherwise specified in
Paragraph 11(f)(iii), the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor at the times specified in Paragraph 11(f)(ii) the relevant Interest Amount to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by
the Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose).  Paragraph 6. Default
 If an Early Termination Date is designated or deemed to occur as a result of an Event of Default in relation to a party,
an amount equal to the Value of the Credit Support Balance, determined as though the Early Termination Date were a Valuation Date, will be deemed to be an Unpaid Amount due to the Transferor (which may or may not be the Defaulting Party) for
purposes of Section 6(e). For the avoidance of doubt, if Market Quotation is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Market Quotation determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction
constituted by this Annex will be deemed to be zero, and, if Loss is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Loss determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction will be limited to the Unpaid
Amount representing the Value of the Credit Support Balance.

Paragraph 7. Representation 
Each party represents to the other party (which representation will be deemed to be repeated as of each date on which it transfers
Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent Distributions) that it is the sole owner of or otherwise has the right to transfer all Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent Distributions it transfers to
the other party under this Annex, free and clear of any security interest, lien, encumbrance or other restriction (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system). 
Paragraph 8. Expenses  Each party will pay its own costs and expenses (including any stamp, transfer or similar transaction tax or duty payable on any transfer it is required to make under this Annex) in connection with
performing its obligations under this Annex, and neither party will be liable for any such costs and expenses incurred by the other party. 
Paragraph 9. Miscellaneous  (a)        Default Interest.    Other than in the case of an amount which is the subject of a dispute under
Paragraph 4(a), if a Transferee fails to make, when due, any transfer of Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or the Interest Amount, it will be obliged to pay the Transferor (to the extent permitted under applicable law) an amount
equal to interest at the Default Rate multiplied by the Value on the relevant Valuation Date of the items of property that were required to be transferred, from (and including) the date that the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or
Interest Amount were required to be transferred to (but excluding) the date of transfer of the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount. This interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual
number of days elapsed.  (b)        Good Faith and Commercially Reasonable
Manner.      Performance of all obligations under this Annex, including, but not limited to, all calculations, valuations and determinations made by either party, will be made in good faith and in a commercially
reasonable manner.  (c)        Demands and
Notices.    All demands and notices given by a party under this Annex will be given as specified in Section 12 of this Agreement.  (d)        Specifications of Certain Matters.      Anything referred to in this Annex as being specified in Paragraph 11
also may be specified in one or more Confirmations or other documents and this Annex will be construed accordingly.  Paragraph

(a)
on the second London/New York Business Day before the beginning of the Interest Period (a US$ Floating Rate Set Date) the Agent Bank will determine
the rate USD-LIBOR-ICE, as the applicable Floating Rate Option, as being the rate applicable to any Interest Period for one month deposits in US$ in the London inter bank market which appears on the Rate Page at approximately 11.45am
(London time) on the US$ Floating Rate Set Date; and   


(b)
if the rate referred to in paragraph (a) does not appear on the Rate Page on the relevant US$ Floating Rate Set Date, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period
will be determined as if the Issuer Trustee and the Agent Bank had specified USD-LIBOR-Reference Banks, as the applicable Floating Rate Option. For this purpose USD-LIBOR-Reference Banks means that the rate for an
Interest Period will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits in US$ are offered by the Reference Banks (being four major banks in the London interbank market determined by the Agent Bank) at approximately 11.00am, London time, on
the US$ Floating Rate Set Date to prime banks in the London interbank market for a period of one month commencing on the first day of the Interest Period and in a Representative Amount (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions of the International
Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.). The Agent Bank will request the principal London office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest
Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer than two quotations are provided as requested, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by not less than two major banks in New York
City, selected by the Agent Bank, at approximately 11.00am, New York City time, on that US$ Floating Rate Set Date for loans in US$ to leading European banks for a period of one month commencing on the first day of the Interest Period and in a
Representative Amount. If no such rates are available in New York City, then the USD-LIBOR-ICE for such Interest Period will be the most recently determined rate in accordance with paragraph (a). 
US$ Equivalent has the meaning given to that term in the Series Supplement.  Terms defined in the Note Conditions have the same meaning in this Confirmation unless otherwise defined in this Confirmation.

 MASTER AGREEMENT  dated as of          .........15 October
2015............... 






 Macquarie Bank Limited ABN 46 008 583 542 (MBL and hereinafter included in the expression Party
A) Macquarie Securities Management Pty Limited ABN 26 003 435 443 (the Manager)
  
 Perpetual Trustee Company Limited ABN 42 000 001 007 in its capacity as trustee of the SMART ABS Series 2015-3US Trust (Party
B)
 have entered and/or anticipate entering into one or more transactions (each a Transaction) that are or will be
governed by this Master Agreement, which includes the schedule (the Schedule), and the documents and other confirming evidence (each a Confirmation) exchanged between the parties confirming those Transactions. 
Accordingly, the parties agree as follows:    


1.
 Interpretation  (a)      Definitions. The terms defined in Section 14 and in the Schedule will have the meanings therein specified for the purpose of
this Master Agreement.  (b)      Inconsistency. In the event of any
inconsistency between the provisions of the Schedule and the other provisions of this Master Agreement, the Schedule will prevail. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of any Confirmation and this Master Agreement (including the
Schedule), such Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the relevant Transaction. 
(c)      Single Agreement. All Transactions are entered into in reliance on the fact
that this Master Agreement and all Confirmations form a single agreement between the parties (collectively referred to as this Agreement), and the parties would not otherwise enter into any Transactions. 
 


2.
 Obligations  (a)      General Conditions.  (i) Each party will make each payment or delivery specified in each Confirmation to be made by it, subject to the other provisions of this Agreement. 
(ii) Payments under this Agreement will be made on the due date for value on that date in the place of the account
specified in the relevant Confirmation or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, in freely transferable funds and in the manner customary for payments in the required currency. Where settlement is by delivery (that is, other than by payment), such
delivery will be made for receipt on the due date in the manner customary for the relevant obligation unless otherwise specified in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement. 
(iii) Each obligation of each party under Section 2(a)(i) is subject to (1) the condition precedent that no
Event of Default or Potential Event of Default with respect to the other party has occurred and is continuing, (2) the condition precedent that no Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction has occurred or been effectively
designated and (3) each other applicable condition precedent specified in this Agreement.  Copyright © 1992 by

(b)      Change of Account. Either party may
change its account for receiving a payment or delivery by giving notice to the other party at least five Local Business Days prior to the scheduled date for the payment or delivery to which such change applies unless such other party gives timely
notice of a reasonable objection to such change.  (c)      Netting. If on any date
amounts would otherwise be payable:  (i)     in the same currency; and
 (ii)    in respect of the same Transaction, 
by each party to the other, then, on such date, each partys obligation to make payment of any such amount will be automatically
satisfied and discharged and, if the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by one party exceeds the aggregate amount that would otherwise have been payable by the other party, replaced by an obligation upon the party by whom the
larger aggregate amount would have been payable to pay to the other party the excess of the larger aggregate amount over the smaller aggregate amount.  The parties may elect in respect of two or more Transactions that a net amount will be determined in respect of all amounts payable on the same date in the same currency in respect of such Transactions,
regardless of whether such amounts are payable in respect of the same Transaction. The election may be made in the Schedule or a Confirmation by specifying that subparagraph (ii) above will not apply to the Transactions identified as being
subject to the election, together with the starting date (in which case subparagraph (ii) above will not, or will cease to, apply to such Transactions from such date). This election may be made separately for different groups of Transactions
and will apply separately to each pairing of Offices through which the parties make and receive payments or deliveries.   


(d)
 Deduction or Withholding for Tax. 
(i)    Gross-Up. All payments under this
Agreement will be made without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax unless such deduction or withholding is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental revenue authority, then in
effect. If a party is so required to deduct or withhold, then that party (X) will: 
(1)    promptly notify the other party (Y) of such requirement; 
(2)    pay to the relevant authorities the full amount required to be deducted or withheld (including
the full amount required to be deducted or withheld from any additional amount paid by X to Y under this Section 2(d)) promptly upon the earlier of determining that such deduction or withholding is required or receiving notice that such amount
has been assessed against Y;  (3)    promptly forward to Y an official receipt (or a
certified copy), or other documentation reasonably acceptable to Y, evidencing such payment to such authorities; and  (4)    if such Tax is an Indemnifiable Tax, pay to Y, in addition to the payment to which Y is otherwise entitled under this Agreement, such additional amount as is necessary to ensure
that the net amount actually received by Y (free and clear of Indemnifiable Taxes, whether assessed against X or Y) will equal the full amount Y would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. However, X will not be required
to pay any additional amount to Y to the extent that it would not be required to be paid but for: 
(A)    the failure by Y to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i),
4(a)(iii) or 4(d); or  (B)    the failure of a representation made by Y pursuant to
Section 3(f) to be accurate and true unless such failure would not have occurred but for (I) any action taken by a taxing authority, or brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered
into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (II) a Change in Tax Law.

(ii)    Liability. If:  
(1)    X is required by any applicable law, as modified by the practice of any relevant governmental
revenue authority, to make any deduction or withholding in respect of which X would not be required to pay an additional amount to Y under Section 2(d)(i)(4); 
(2)    X does not so deduct or withhold; and 
(3)    a liability resulting from such Tax is assessed directly against X, 
then, except to the extent Y has satisfied or then satisfies the liability resulting from such Tax, Y will promptly pay to
X the amount of such liability (including any related liability for interest, but including any related liability for penalties only if Y has failed to comply with or perform any agreement contained in Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii) or 4(d)).
 (e)      Default Interest, Other Amounts. Prior to the occurrence or effective
designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction, a party that defaults in the performance of any payment obligation will, to the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 6(c), be required to pay interest
(before as well as after judgment) on the overdue amount to the other party on demand in the same currency as such overdue amount, for the period from (and including) the original due date for payment to (but excluding) the date of actual payment,
at the Default Rate. Such interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. If, prior to the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date in respect of the relevant Transaction,
a party defaults in the performance of any obligation required to be settled by delivery, it will compensate the other party on demand if and to the extent provided for in the relevant Confirmation or elsewhere in this Agreement. 
 


3.
 Representations  Each party represents to the other party (which representations will be deemed to be repeated by each party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into and, in the case of the
representations in Section 3(f), at all times until the termination of this Agreement) that:   


(a)
 Basic Representations.  (i)    Status. It is duly organised and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organisation or incorporation and, if relevant under such laws, in good
standing;  (ii)    Powers. It has the power to execute this Agreement and any
other documentation relating to this Agreement to which it is a party, to deliver this Agreement and any other documentation relating to this Agreement that it is required by this Agreement to deliver and to perform its obligations under this
Agreement and any obligations it has under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and has taken all necessary action to authorise such execution, delivery and performance; 
(iii)    No Violation or Conflict. Such execution, delivery and performance do not
violate or conflict with any law applicable to it, any provision of its constitutional documents, any order or judgment of any court or other agency of government applicable to it or any of its assets or any contractual restriction binding on or
affecting it or any of its assets;  (iv)    Consents. All governmental and
other consents that are required to have been obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party have been obtained and are in full force and effect and all conditions of any such consents have been
complied with; and  (v)    Obligations Binding. Its obligations under this
Agreement and any Credit Support Document to which it is a party constitute its legal, valid and binding obligations, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganisation, insolvency, moratorium or
similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and subject, as to enforceability, to equitable principles of general application (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law)).

(b)      Absence of Certain Events. No Event of
Default or Potential Event of Default or, to its knowledge, Termination Event with respect to it has occurred and is continuing and no such event or circumstance would occur as a result of its entering into or performing its obligations under this
Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party.  (c)      Absence of
Litigation. There is not pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against it or any of its Affiliates any action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity or before any court, tribunal, governmental body, agency or official or any arbitrator
that is likely to affect the legality, validity or enforceability against it of this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party or its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or such Credit Support Document.
 (d)      Accuracy of Specified Information. All applicable information that is
furnished in writing by or on behalf of it to the other party and is identified for the purpose of this Section 3(d) in the Schedule is, as of the date of the information, true, accurate and complete in every material respect. 
(e)      Payer Tax Representation. Each representation specified in the Schedule as being made
by it for the purpose of this Section 3(e) is accurate and true.  (f)      Payee Tax
Representations. Each representation specified in the Schedule as being made by it for the purpose of this Section 3(f) is accurate and true.   


4.
 Agreements  Each party agrees with the other that, so long as either party has or may have any obligation under this Agreement or under any Credit Support Document to which it is a party: 
(a)      Furnish Specified Information. It will deliver to the other party or, in certain
cases under subparagraph (iii) below, to such government or taxing authority as the other party reasonably directs:  (i)      any forms, documents or certificates relating to taxation specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation; 
(ii)     any other documents specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation; and 
(iii)    upon reasonable demand by such other party, any form or document that may be required or
reasonably requested in writing in order to allow such other party or its Credit Support Provider to make a payment under this Agreement or any applicable Credit Support Document without any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or
with such deduction or withholding at a reduced rate (so long as the completion, execution or submission of such form or document would not materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of the party in receipt of such demand), with any such
form or document to be accurate and completed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to such other party and to be executed and to be delivered with any reasonably required certification, 
in each case by the date specified in the Schedule or such Confirmation or, if none is specified, as soon as reasonably practicable.
 (b)      Maintain Authorisations. It will use all reasonable efforts to maintain
in full force and effect all consents of any governmental or other authority that are required to be obtained by it with respect to this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is a party and will use all reasonable efforts to obtain
any that may become necessary in the future.  (c)      Comply with Laws. It will
comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and orders to which it may be subject if failure so to comply would materially impair its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it is
a party.  (d)      Tax Agreement. It will give notice of any failure of a
representation made by it under Section 3(f) to be accurate and true promptly upon learning of such failure. 
(e)      Payment of Stamp Tax. Subject to Section 11, it will pay any Stamp Tax levied or
imposed upon it or in respect of its execution or performance of this Agreement by a jurisdiction in which it is incorporated,

organised, managed and controlled, or considered to have its seat, or in which a branch or office through which it is acting for the purpose of this Agreement is located (Stamp Tax
Jurisdiction) and will indemnify the other party against any Stamp Tax levied or imposed upon the other party or in respect of the other partys execution or performance of this Agreement by any such Stamp Tax Jurisdiction which is not
also a Stamp Tax Jurisdiction with respect to the other party.   


5.
 Events of Default and Termination Events  (a)       Events of Default. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or
any Specified Entity of such party of any of the following events constitutes an event of default (an Event of Default) with respect to such party: 
(i)    Failure to Pay or Deliver. Failure by the party to make, when due, any payment
under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) required to be made by it if such failure is not remedied on or before the third Local Business Day after notice of such failure is given to the party; 
(ii)    Breach of Agreement. Failure by the party to comply with or perform any
agreement or obligation (other than an obligation to make any payment under this Agreement or delivery under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) or to give notice of a Termination Event or any agreement or obligation under Section 4(a)(i), 4(a)(iii)
or 4(d)) to be complied with or performed by the party in accordance with this Agreement if such failure is not remedied on or before the thirtieth day after notice of such failure is given to the party; 
(iii)    Credit Support Default. 
(1)   Failure by the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party to comply with or perform any agreement
or obligation to be complied with or performed by it in accordance with any Credit Support Document if such failure is continuing after any applicable grace period has elapsed; 
(2)   the expiration or termination of such Credit Support Document or the failing or ceasing of such
Credit Support Document to be in full force and effect for the purpose of this Agreement (in either case other than in accordance with its terms) prior to the satisfaction of all obligations of such party under each Transaction to which such Credit
Support Document relates without the written consent of the other party; or  (3)   the party or
such Credit Support Provider disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or rejects, in whole or in part, or challenges the validity of, such Credit Support Document;  (iv)     Misrepresentation. A representation (other than a representation under Section 3(e) or (f)) made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated by
the party or any Credit Support Provider of such party in this Agreement or any Credit Support Document proves to have been incorrect or misleading in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated; 
(v)     Default under Specified Transaction. The party, any Credit Support Provider
of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party (1) defaults under a Specified Transaction and, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, there occurs a liquidation of, an acceleration of
obligations under, or an early termination of, that Specified Transaction, (2) defaults, after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period, in making any payment or delivery due on the last payment, delivery or exchange
date of, or any payment on early termination of, a Specified Transaction (or such default continues for at least three Local Business Days if there is no applicable notice requirement or grace period) or (3) disaffirms, disclaims, repudiates or
rejects, in whole or in part, a Specified Transaction (or such action is taken by any person or entity appointed or empowered to operate it or act on its behalf); 
(vi)     Cross Default. If Cross Default is specified in the Schedule
as applying to the party, the occurrence or existence of (1) a default, event of default or other similar condition or event (however

described) in respect of such party, any Credit Support Provider of such
party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party under one or more agreements or instruments relating to Specified Indebtedness of any of them (individually or collectively) in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold
Amount (as specified in the Schedule) which has resulted in such Specified Indebtedness becoming, or becoming capable at such time of being declared, due and payable under such agreements or instruments, before it would otherwise have been due and
payable or (2) a default by such party, such Credit Support Provider or such Specified Entity (individually or collectively) in making one or more payments on the due date thereof in an aggregate amount of not less than the applicable Threshold
Amount under such agreements or instruments (after giving effect to any applicable notice requirement or grace period);  (vii)    Bankruptcy. The party, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party:  
(1)   is dissolved (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (2) becomes insolvent
or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due; (3) makes a general assignment, arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors; (4) institutes or
has instituted against it a proceeding seeking a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors rights, or a petition is presented for its winding-up or liquidation, and, in the case of any such proceeding or petition instituted or presented against it, such proceeding or petition (A) results in a judgment of insolvency or bankruptcy or the entry
of an order for relief or the making of an order for its winding-up or liquidation or (B) is not dismissed, discharged, stayed or restrained in each case within 30 days of the institution or presentation
thereof; (5) has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management or liquidation (other than pursuant to a consolidation, amalgamation or merger); (6) seeks or becomes subject to the
appointment of an administrator, provisional liquidator, conservator, receiver, trustee, custodian or other similar official for it or for all or substantially all its assets; (7) has a secured party take possession of all or substantially all
its assets or has a distress, execution, attachment, sequestration or other legal process levied, enforced or sued on or against all or substantially all its assets and such secured party maintains possession, or any such process is not dismissed,
discharged, stayed or restrained, in each case within 30 days thereafter; (8) causes or is subject to any event with respect to it which, under the applicable laws of any jurisdiction, has an analogous effect to any of the events specified in
clauses (1) to (7) (inclusive); or (9) takes any action in furtherance of, or indicating its consent to, approval of, or acquiescence in, any of the foregoing acts; or 
(viii)    Merger Without Assumption. The party or any Credit Support Provider of such
party consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all its assets to, another entity and, at the time of such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer:  
(1)   the resulting, surviving or transferee entity fails to assume all the obligations of such party or such
Credit Support Provider under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document to which it or its predecessor was a party by operation of law or pursuant to an agreement reasonably satisfactory to the other party to this Agreement; or 
(2)   the benefits of any Credit Support Document fail to extend (without the consent of the other party)
to the performance by such resulting, surviving or transferee entity of its obligations under this Agreement. 
(b)       Termination Events. The occurrence at any time with respect to a party or, if
applicable, any Credit Support Provider of such party or any Specified Entity of such party of any event specified below constitutes an Illegality if the event is specified in (i) below, a Tax Event if the event is specified in (ii) below
or a Tax Event Upon Merger if the event is specified in (iii) below, and, if specified to be applicable, a Credit Event

ISDA® 1992



Upon Merger if the event is specified pursuant to (iv) below or an Additional Termination Event if the event is specified pursuant to (v) below: 
(i)     Illegality. Due to the adoption of, or any change in, any applicable law after
the date on which a Transaction is entered into, or due to the promulgation of, or any change in, the interpretation by any court, tribunal or regulatory authority with competent jurisdiction of any applicable law after such date, it becomes
unlawful (other than as a result of a breach by the party of Section 4(b)) for such party (which will be the Affected Party):   (1)   to perform any absolute or contingent obligation to make a payment or delivery or to receive a payment or delivery in respect of such Transaction or to comply with any other material
provision of this Agreement relating to such Transaction; or  (2)   to perform, or for any
Credit Support Provider of such party to perform, any contingent or other obligation which the party (or such Credit Support Provider) has under any Credit Support Document relating to such Transaction; 
(ii)     Tax Event. Due to (x) any action taken by a taxing authority, or
brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, on or after the date on which a Transaction is entered into (regardless of whether such action is taken or brought with respect to a party to this Agreement) or (y) a Change in Tax Law, the party
(which will be the Affected Party) will, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will, on the next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date (1) be required to pay to the other party an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under
Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or (2) receive a payment from which an amount is required to be deducted or withheld for or on account of a Tax (except in respect of interest
under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) and no additional amount is required to be paid in respect of such Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (other than by reason of Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)); 
(iii)     Tax Event Upon Merger. The party (the Burdened Party) on the
next succeeding Scheduled Payment Date will either (1) be required to pay an additional amount in respect of an Indemnifiable Tax under Section 2(d)(i)(4) (except in respect of interest under Section 2(e), 6(d)(ii) or 6(e)) or
(2) receive a payment from which an amount has been deducted or withheld for or on account of any Indemnifiable Tax in respect of which the other party is not required to pay an additional amount (other than by reason of
Section 2(d)(i)(4)(A) or (B)), in either case as a result of a party consolidating or amalgamating with, or merging with or into, or transferring all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (which will be the Affected Party) where
such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii); 
(iv)     Credit Event Upon Merger. If Credit Event Upon Merger is
specified in the Schedule as applying to the party, such party (X), any Credit Support Provider of X or any applicable Specified Entity of X consolidates or amalgamates with, or merges with or into, or transfers all or substantially all
its assets to, another entity and such action does not constitute an event described in Section 5(a)(viii) but the creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity is materially weaker than that of X, such Credit Support
Provider or such Specified Entity, as the case may be, immediately prior to such action (and, in such event, X or its successor or transferee, as appropriate, will be the Affected Party); or 
(v)     Additional Termination Event. If any Additional Termination
Event is specified in the Schedule or any Confirmation as applying, the occurrence of such event (and, in such event, the Affected Party or Affected Parties shall be as specified for such Additional Termination Event in the Schedule or such
Confirmation).  (c)       Event of Default and Illegality. If an event or
circumstance which would otherwise constitute or give rise to an Event of Default also constitutes an Illegality, it will be treated as an Illegality and will not constitute an Event of Default.

6.
 Early Termination  (a)       Right to Terminate Following Event of Default. If at any time an Event of Default with respect to a party (the Defaulting Party) has
occurred and is then continuing, the other party (the Non-defaulting Party) may, by not more than 20 days notice to the Defaulting Party specifying the relevant Event of Default, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is
effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding Transactions. If, however, Automatic Early Termination is specified in the Schedule as applying to a party, then an Early Termination Date in respect of all outstanding
Transactions will occur immediately upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(1), (3), (5), (6) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8), and as of the time immediately preceding
the institution of the relevant proceeding or the presentation of the relevant petition upon the occurrence with respect to such party of an Event of Default specified in Section 5(a)(vii)(4) or, to the extent analogous thereto, (8).
 (b)       Right to Terminate Following Termination Event. 
(i)     Notice. If a Termination Event occurs, an Affected Party will, promptly upon
becoming aware of it, notify the other party, specifying the nature of that Termination Event and each Affected Transaction and will also give such other information about that Termination Event as the other party may reasonably require. 
(ii)     Transfer to Avoid Termination Event. If either an Illegality under
Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there is only one Affected Party, or if a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is the Affected Party, the Affected Party will, as a condition to its right to designate an Early
Termination Date under Section 6(b)(iv), use all reasonable efforts (which will not require such party to incur a loss, excluding immaterial, incidental expenses) to transfer within 20 days after it gives notice under Section 6(b)(i) all
its rights and obligations under this Agreement in respect of the Affected Transactions to another of its Offices or Affiliates so that such Termination Event ceases to exist. 
If the Affected Party is not able to make such a transfer it will give notice to the other party to that effect within
such 20 day period, whereupon the other party may effect such a transfer within 30 days after the notice is given under Section 6(b)(i).  Any such transfer by a party under this Section 6(b)(ii) will be subject to and conditional upon the prior written consent of the other party, which consent will not be withheld if such other
partys policies in effect at such time would permit it to enter into transactions with the transferee on the terms proposed.  (iii)     Two Affected Parties. If an Illegality under Section 5(b)(i)(1) or a Tax Event occurs and there are two Affected Parties, each party will use all
reasonable efforts to reach agreement within 30 days after notice thereof is given under Section 6(b)(i) on action to avoid that Termination Event.  (iv)     Right to Terminate. If:   (1)   a transfer under Section 6(b)(ii) or an agreement under Section 6(b)(iii), as the case may be, has not been effected with respect to all Affected Transactions within 30 days
after an Affected Party gives notice under Section 6(b)(i); or  (2)   an Illegality under
Section 5(b)(i)(2), a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event occurs, or a Tax Event Upon Merger occurs and the Burdened Party is not the Affected Party, 
either party in the case of an Illegality, the Burdened Party in the case of a Tax Event Upon Merger, any Affected Party
in the case of a Tax Event or an Additional Termination Event if there is more than one Affected Party, or the party which is not the Affected Party in the case of a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event if there is only one
Affected Party may, by not more than 20 days notice to the other party and provided that the relevant Termination Event is then

ISDA® 1992



continuing, designate a day not earlier than the day such notice is effective as an Early Termination Date in respect of all Affected Transactions. 
 


(c)
 Effect of Designation. 
(i)     If notice designating an Early Termination Date is given under Section 6(a) or (b), the
Early Termination Date will occur on the date so designated, whether or not the relevant Event of Default or Termination Event is then continuing.  (ii)     Upon the occurrence or effective designation of an Early Termination Date, no further payments or deliveries under Section 2(a)(i) or 2(e) in respect of the Terminated
Transactions will be required to be made, but without prejudice to the other provisions of this Agreement. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an Early Termination Date shall be determined pursuant to Section 6(e). 
 


(d)
 Calculations.  (i)     Statement. On or as soon as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of an Early Termination Date, each party will make the calculations on its part, if
any, contemplated by Section 6(e) and will provide to the other party a statement (1) showing, in reasonable detail, such calculations (including all relevant quotations and specifying any amount payable under Section 6(e)) and
(2) giving details of the relevant account to which any amount payable to it is to be paid. In the absence of written confirmation from the source of a quotation obtained in determining a Market Quotation, the records of the party obtaining
such quotation will be conclusive evidence of the existence and accuracy of such quotation. 
(ii)     Payment Date. An amount calculated as being due in respect of any Early
Termination Date under Section 6(e) will be payable on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated or occurs as a result of an Event of Default) and on the day which is
two Local Business Days after the day on which notice of the amount payable is effective (in the case of an Early Termination Date which is designated as a result of a Termination Event). Such amount will be paid together with (to the extent
permitted under applicable law) interest thereon (before as well as after judgment) in the Termination Currency, from (and including) the relevant Early Termination Date to (but excluding) the date such amount is paid, at the Applicable Rate. Such
interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. 
(e)       Payments on Early Termination. If an Early Termination Date occurs, the following
provisions shall apply based on the parties election in the Schedule of a payment measure, either Market Quotation or Loss, and a payment method, either the First Method or the Second Method. If
the parties fail to designate a payment measure or payment method in the Schedule, it will be deemed that Market Quotation or the Second Method, as the case may be, shall apply. The amount, if any, payable in respect of an
Early Termination Date and determined pursuant to this Section will be subject to any Set-off.  (i)     Events of Default. If the Early Termination Date results from an Event of Default:  
(1) First Method and Market Quotation. If the First Method and Market Quotation apply, the Defaulting Party will
pay to the Non-defaulting Party the excess, if a positive number, of (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the Non-defaulting Party) in respect of the
Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party over (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
Defaulting Party.  (2)   First Method and Loss. If the First Method and Loss apply, the
Defaulting Party will pay to the Non-defaulting Party, if a positive number, the Non-defaulting Partys Loss in respect of this Agreement. 
(3)   Second Method and Market Quotation. If the Second Method and Market Quotation apply, an amount will
be payable equal to (A) the sum of the Settlement Amount (determined by the

ISDA® 1992


Non-defaulting Party) in respect of
the Terminated Transactions and the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the Non-defaulting Party less (B) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to the
Defaulting Party. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party
will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.  (4)   Second Method and
Loss. If the Second Method and Loss apply, an amount will be payable equal to the Non-defaulting Partys Loss in respect of this Agreement. If that amount is a positive number, the Defaulting Party
will pay it to the Non-defaulting Party; if it is a negative number, the Non-defaulting Party will pay the absolute value of that amount to the Defaulting Party.
 (ii)     Termination Events. If the Early Termination Date results from a
Termination Event:   (1)    One Affected Party. If there is one Affected Party, the
amount payable will be determined in accordance with Section 6(e)(i)(3), if Market Quotation applies, or Section 6(e)(i)(4), if Loss applies, except that, in either case, references to the Defaulting Party and to the Non-defaulting Party will be deemed to be references to the Affected Party and the party which is not the Affected Party, respectively, and, if Loss applies and fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated,
Loss shall be calculated in respect of all Terminated Transactions.  (2)    Two Affected
Parties. If there are two Affected Parties:   (A) if Market Quotation applies, each party will
determine a Settlement Amount in respect of the Terminated Transactions, and an amount will be payable equal to (I) the sum of (a) one-half of the difference between the Settlement Amount of the
party with the higher Settlement Amount (X) and the Settlement Amount of the party with the lower Settlement Amount (Y) and (b) the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to X less (II) the
Termination Currency Equivalent of the Unpaid Amounts owing to Y; and  (B) if Loss applies, each party
will determine its Loss in respect of this Agreement (or, if fewer than all the Transactions are being terminated, in respect of all Terminated Transactions) and an amount will be payable equal to one-half of
the difference between the Loss of the party with the higher Loss (X) and the Loss of the party with the lower Loss (Y).  If the amount payable is a positive number, Y will pay it to X; if it is a negative number, X will pay the absolute value of that amount to Y. 
(iii)     Adjustment for Bankruptcy. In circumstances where an Early Termination Date
occurs because Automatic Early Termination applies in respect of a party, the amount determined under this Section 6(e) will be subject to such adjustments as are appropriate and permitted by law to reflect any payments or
deliveries made by one party to the other under this Agreement (and retained by such other party) during the period from the relevant Early Termination Date to the date for payment determined under Section 6(d)(ii). 
(iv)    Pre-Estimate. The parties agree that if
Market Quotation applies an amount recoverable under this Section 6(e) is a reasonable pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. Such amount is payable for the loss of bargain and the loss of protection
against future risks and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement neither party will be entitled to recover any additional damages as a consequence of such losses.

7.
 Transfer  Subject to Section 6(b)(ii), neither this Agreement nor any interest or obligation in or under this Agreement may be transferred (whether by way of security or otherwise) by either party without the
prior written consent of the other party, except that:   (a)       a party may make such a
transfer of this Agreement pursuant to a consolidation or amalgamation with, or merger with or into, or transfer of all or substantially all its assets to, another entity (but without prejudice to any other right or remedy under this Agreement); and
 (b)       a party may make such a transfer of all or any part of its interest in any amount
payable to it from a Defaulting Party under Section 6(e).  Any purported transfer that is not in compliance with this
Section will be void.   


8.
 Contractual Currency  (a)       Payment in the Contractual Currency. Each payment under this Agreement will be made in the relevant currency specified in this Agreement for that
payment (the Contractual Currency). To the extent permitted by applicable law, any obligation to make payments under this Agreement in the Contractual Currency will not be discharged or satisfied by any tender in any currency other than
the Contractual Currency, except to the extent such tender results in the actual receipt by the party to which payment is owed, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the currency so tendered into the Contractual Currency, of
the full amount in the Contractual Currency of all amounts payable in respect of this Agreement. If for any reason the amount in the Contractual Currency so received falls short of the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this
Agreement, the party required to make the payment will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, immediately pay such additional amount in the Contractual Currency as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall. If for any reason the amount
in the Contractual Currency so received exceeds the amount in the Contractual Currency payable in respect of this Agreement, the party receiving the payment will refund promptly the amount of such excess. 
(b)      Judgments. To the extent permitted by applicable law, if any judgment or order
expressed in a currency other than the Contractual Currency is rendered (i) for the payment of any amount owing in respect of this Agreement, (ii) for the payment of any amount relating to any early termination in respect of this Agreement
or (iii) in respect of a judgment or order of another court for the payment of any amount described in (i) or (ii) above, the party seeking recovery, after recovery in full of the aggregate amount to which such party is entitled
pursuant to the judgment or order, will be entitled to receive immediately from the other party the amount of any shortfall of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency and will refund
promptly to the other party any excess of the Contractual Currency received by such party as a consequence of sums paid in such other currency if such shortfall or such excess arises or results from any variation between the rate of exchange at
which the Contractual Currency is converted into the currency of the judgment or order for the purposes of such judgment or order and the rate of exchange at which such party is able, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith in converting the
currency received into the Contractual Currency, to purchase the Contractual Currency with the amount of the currency of the judgment or order actually received by such party. The term rate of exchange includes, without limitation, any
premiums and costs of exchange payable in connection with the purchase of or conversion into the Contractual Currency. 
(c)       Separate Indemnities. To the extent permitted by applicable law, these indemnities
constitute separate and independent obligations from the other obligations in this Agreement, will be enforceable as separate and independent causes of action, will apply notwithstanding any indulgence granted by the party to which any payment is
owed and will not be affected by judgment being obtained or claim or proof being made for any other sums payable in respect of this Agreement.  (d)       Evidence of Loss. For the purpose of this Section 8, it will be sufficient for a party to demonstrate that it would have suffered a loss had an
actual exchange or purchase been made.

 Miscellaneous  (a)       Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties with respect to its subject matter and supersedes
all oral communication and prior writings with respect thereto.  (b)      
Amendments. No amendment, modification or waiver in respect of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing (including a writing evidenced by a facsimile transmission) and executed by each of the parties or confirmed by an
exchange of telexes or electronic messages on an electronic messaging system. 
(c)       Survival of Obligations. Without prejudice to Sections 2(a)(iii) and 6(c)(ii),
the obligations of the parties under this Agreement will survive the termination of any Transaction. 
(d)       Remedies Cumulative. Except as provided in this Agreement, the rights, powers,
remedies and privileges provided in this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers, remedies and privileges provided by law.   


(e)      
 Counterparts and Confirmations. 
(i) This Agreement (and each amendment, modification and waiver in respect of it) may be executed and delivered in
counterparts (including by facsimile transmission), each of which will be deemed an original.  (ii) The parties
intend that they are legally bound by the terms of each Transaction from the moment they agree to those terms (whether orally or otherwise). A Confirmation shall be entered into as soon as practicable and may be executed and delivered in
counterparts (including by facsimile transmission) or be created by an exchange of telexes or by an exchange of electronic messages on an electronic messaging system, which in each case will be sufficient for all purposes to evidence a binding
supplement to this Agreement. The parties will specify therein or through another effective means that any such counterpart, telex or electronic message constitutes a Confirmation. 
(f)       No Waiver of Rights. A failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege
in respect of this Agreement will not be presumed to operate as a waiver, and a single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege will not be presumed to preclude any subsequent or further exercise, of that right, power or privilege or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.  (g)       Headings. The headings
used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction of or to be taken into consideration in interpreting this Agreement.   


10.
 Offices; Multibranch Parties  (a)       If Section 10(a) is specified in the Schedule as applying, each party that enters into a Transaction through an Office other than its head or home office
represents to the other party that, notwithstanding the place of booking office or jurisdiction of incorporation or organisation of such party, the obligations of such party are the same as if it had entered into the Transaction through its head or
home office. This representation will be deemed to be repeated by such party on each date on which a Transaction is entered into.  (b)       Neither party may change the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries for the purpose of a Transaction without the prior written consent of
the other party.  (c)       If a party is specified as a Multibranch Party in the Schedule, such
Multibranch Party may make and receive payments or deliveries under any Transaction through any Office listed in the Schedule, and the Office through which it makes and receives payments or deliveries with respect to a Transaction will be specified
in the relevant Confirmation.   


11.
 Expenses  A Defaulting Party will, on demand, indemnify and hold harmless the other party for and against all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, including legal fees and Stamp Tax, incurred by such other party by reason of the enforcement and protection of its rights under this Agreement or any Credit Support Document

to which the Defaulting Party is a party or by reason of the early termination of any Transaction, including, but not limited to, costs of collection. 
 


12.
 Notices  (a)       Effectiveness. Any notice or other communication in respect of this Agreement may be given in any manner set forth below (except that a notice or

recipients answerback is received;  (iii)     if sent by facsimile transmission,
on the date that transmission is received by a responsible employee of the recipient in legible form (it being agreed that the burden of proving receipt will be on the sender and will not be met by a transmission report generated by the
senders facsimile machine);  (iv)     if sent by certified or registered mail
(airmail, if overseas) or the equivalent (return receipt requested), on the date that mail is delivered or its delivery is attempted; or  (v)     if sent by electronic messaging system, on the date that electronic message is received,  unless the date of that delivery (or attempted delivery) or that receipt, as applicable, is not a Local Business Day or that communication is delivered (or attempted) or received, as applicable, after the
close of business on a Local Business Day, in which case that communication shall be deemed given and effective on the first following day that is a Local Business Day.  (b)       Change of Addresses. Either party may by notice to the other change the address, telex or facsimile number or electronic messaging system details at
which notices or other communications are to be given to it.   


13.
 Governing Law and Jurisdiction  (a)       Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the law specified in the Schedule. 
(b)       Jurisdiction. With respect to any suit, action or proceedings relating to this
Agreement (Proceedings), each party irrevocably:  (i)     submits to the
jurisdiction of the English courts, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, or to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United States District
Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by the laws of the State of New York; and  (ii)     waives any objection which it may have at any time to the laying of venue of any Proceedings brought in any such court, waives any claim that such Proceedings have been
brought in an inconvenient forum and further waives the right to object, with respect to such Proceedings, that such court does not have any jurisdiction over such party.  Nothing in this Agreement precludes either party from bringing Proceedings in any other jurisdiction (outside, if this Agreement is expressed to be governed by English law, the Contracting States, as
defined in Section 1(3) of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 or any modification, extension or re-enactment thereof for the time being in force) nor will the bringing of Proceedings in any one
or more jurisdictions preclude the bringing of Proceedings in any other jurisdiction.  (c)      
Service of Process. Each party irrevocably appoints the Process Agent (if any) specified opposite its name in the Schedule to receive, for it and on its behalf, service of process in any Proceedings. If for any

 









 
13
 
ISDA® 1992



reason any partys Process Agent is unable to act as such, such party will promptly notify the other party and within 30 days appoint a substitute process agent acceptable to the other
party. The parties irrevocably consent to service of process given in the manner provided for notices in Section 12. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of either party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
 (d)       Waiver of Immunities. Each party irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, with respect to itself and its revenues and assets (irrespective of their use or intended use), all immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or other similar grounds from (i) suit, (ii) jurisdiction of any
court, (iii) relief by way of injunction, order for specific performance or for recovery of property, (iv) attachment of its assets (whether before or after judgment) and (v) execution or enforcement of any judgment to which it or its
revenues or assets might otherwise be entitled in any Proceedings in the courts of any jurisdiction and irrevocably agrees, to the extent permitted by applicable law, that it will not claim any such immunity in any Proceedings.

Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith to be its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection
with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including any loss of bargain, cost of funding or, at the election of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a result
of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them). Loss includes losses and costs (or gains) in respect of any payment or delivery required to have been made
(assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) on or before the relevant Early Termination Date and not made, except, so as to avoid duplication, if Section 6(e)(i)(1) or (3) or 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) applies. Loss does not include
a partys legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11. A party will determine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if
that is not reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable. A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the
relevant markets.  Market Quotation means, with respect to one or more Terminated Transactions and a
party making the determination, an amount determined on the basis of quotations from Reference Market-makers. Each quotation will be for an amount, if any, that would be paid to such party (expressed as a negative number) or by such party (expressed
as a positive number) in consideration of an agreement between such party (taking into account any existing Credit Support Document with respect to the obligations of such party) and the quoting Reference Market-maker to enter into a transaction
(the Replacement Transaction) that would have the effect of preserving for such party the economic equivalent of any payment or delivery (whether the underlying obligation was absolute or contingent and assuming the satisfaction of each
applicable condition precedent) by the parties under Section 2(a)(i) in respect of such Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions that would, but for the occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date, have

 









 
15
 
ISDA® 1992



been required after that date. For this purpose, Unpaid Amounts in respect of the Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions are to be excluded but, without limitation, any
payment or delivery that would, but for the relevant Early Termination Date, have been required (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition precedent) after that Early Termination Date is to be included. The Replacement Transaction would be
subject to such documentation as such party and the Reference Market-maker may, in good faith, agree. The party making the determination (or its agent) will request each Reference Market-maker to provide its quotation to the extent reasonably
practicable as of the same day and time (without regard to different time zones) on or as soon as reasonably practicable after the relevant Early Termination Date. The day and time as of which those quotations are to be obtained will be selected in
good faith by the party obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), and, if each party is so obliged, after consultation with the other. If more than three quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the arithmetic mean of the
quotations, without regard to the quotations having the highest and lowest values. If exactly three such quotations are provided, the Market Quotation will be the quotation remaining after disregarding the highest and lowest quotations. For this
purpose, if more than one quotation has the same highest value or lowest value, then one of such quotations shall be disregarded. If fewer than three quotations are provided, it will be deemed that the Market Quotation in respect of such Terminated
Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions cannot be determined.  Non-default Rate means a rate
per annum equal to the cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to the Non-defaulting Party (as certified by it) if it were to fund the relevant amount. 
Non-defaulting Party has the meaning specified in Section 6(a).  Office means a branch or office of a party, which may be such partys head or home office.  Potential Event of Default means any event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default. 
Reference Market-makers means four leading dealers in the relevant market selected by the party determining a
Market Quotation in good faith (a) from among dealers of the highest credit standing which satisfy all the criteria that such party applies generally at the time in deciding whether to offer or to make an extension of credit and (b) to the
extent practicable, from among such dealers having an office in the same city.  Relevant Jurisdiction
means, with respect to a party, the jurisdictions (a) in which the party is incorporated, organised, managed and controlled or considered to have its seat, (b) where an Office through which the party is acting for purposes of this
Agreement is located, (c) in which the party executes this Agreement and (d) in relation to any payment, from or through which such payment is made.  Scheduled Payment Date means a date on which a payment or delivery is to be made under Section 2(a)(i) with respect to a Transaction. 
Set-off means set-off, offset, combination of accounts, right of
retention or withholding or similar right or requirement to which the payer of an amount under Section 6 is entitled or subject (whether arising under this Agreement, another contract, applicable law or otherwise) that is exercised by, or
imposed on, such payer.  Settlement Amount means, with respect to a party and any Early Termination
Date, the sum of:   (a)    the Termination Currency Equivalent of the Market Quotations (whether
positive or negative) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions for which a Market Quotation is determined; and  (b)    such partys Loss (whether positive or negative and without reference to any Unpaid Amounts) for each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions for which a
Market Quotation cannot be determined or would not (in the reasonable belief of the party making the determination) produce a commercially reasonable result.  Specified Entity has the meanings specified in the Schedule.

obligation (whether present or future, contingent or otherwise, as principal or surety or otherwise) in respect of borrowed money.  Specified Transaction means, subject to the Schedule, (a) any transaction (including an agreement with respect thereto) now existing or hereafter entered into between one
party to this Agreement (or any Credit Support Provider of such party or any applicable Specified Entity of such party) and the other party to this Agreement (or any Credit Support Provider of such other party or any applicable Specified Entity of
such other party) which is a rate swap transaction, basis swap, forward rate transaction, commodity swap, commodity option, equity or equity index swap, equity or equity index option, bond option, interest rate option, foreign exchange transaction,
cap transaction, floor transaction, collar transaction, currency swap transaction, cross-currency rate swap transaction, currency option or any other similar transaction (including any option with respect to any of these transactions), (b) any
combination of these transactions and (c) any other transaction identified as a Specified Transaction in this Agreement or the relevant confirmation.  Stamp Tax means any stamp, registration, documentation or similar tax.  Tax means any present or future tax, levy, impost, duty, charge, assessment or fee of any nature (including interest, penalties and additions thereto) that is imposed by any
government or other taxing authority in respect of any payment under this Agreement other than a stamp, registration, documentation or similar tax.  Tax Event has the meaning specified in Section 5(b). 
Tax Event Upon Merger has the meaning specified in Section 5(b).

Automatic Early Termination applies, immediately before that Early Termination Date).  Termination
Currency has the meaning specified in the Schedule.  Termination Currency Equivalent
means, in respect of any amount denominated in the Termination Currency, such Termination Currency amount and, in respect of any amount denominated in a currency other than the Termination Currency (the Other Currency), the amount in the
Termination Currency determined by the party making the relevant determination as being required to purchase such amount of such Other Currency as at the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if the relevant Market Quotation or Loss (as the case may
be), is determined as of a later date, that later date, with the Termination Currency at the rate equal to the spot exchange rate of the foreign exchange agent (selected as provided below) for the purchase of such Other Currency with the Termination
Currency at or about 11:00 a.m. (in the city in which such foreign exchange agent is located) on such date as would be customary for the determination of such a rate for the purchase of such Other Currency for value on the relevant Early Termination
Date or that later date. The foreign exchange agent will, if only one party is obliged to make a determination under Section 6(e), be selected in good faith by that party and otherwise will be agreed by the parties. 
Termination Event means an Illegality, a Tax Event or a Tax Event Upon Merger or, if specified to be applicable,
a Credit Event Upon Merger or an Additional Termination Event.  Termination Rate means a rate per
annum equal to the arithmetic mean of the cost (without proof or evidence of any actual cost) to each party (as certified by such party) if it were to fund or of funding such amounts. 
Unpaid Amounts owing to any party means, with respect to an Early Termination Date, the aggregate of (a) in
respect of all Terminated Transactions, the amounts that became payable (or that would have become payable but for Section 2(a)(iii)) to such party under Section 2(a)(i) on or prior to such Early Termination Date and which remain unpaid as
at such Early Termination Date and (b) in respect of each Terminated Transaction, for each obligation under Section 2(a)(i) which was (or would have been but for Section 2(a)(iii)) required to be settled by delivery to such party on
or prior to such Early Termination Date and which has not been so settled as at such Early Termination Date, an amount equal to the fair market

Trust, as a result of Party Bs fraud, negligence or wilful default.

Transaction Document (other than a person whose acts or omissions Party B is liable for in accordance with any such Transaction Document) to fulfil its obligations relating to the Series Trust or by any other act or omission of such Relevant Party
or any other such person. 
  31 




 
(e)
 (No Authority): No attorney, agent, receiver or receiver and manager appointed in accordance with this Agreement or any Transaction Document

occurrence of the relevant Early Termination Date or Swap Transfer Date (as the case shall be), have been required after that date;

amounts) for the relevant Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions..   


 
(iv)

Quotation expressed as a positive number and (ii) the lower of two Market Quotations expressed as negative numbers is the one with the largest absolute value).

after the relevant Trade Date, send Party B and the Manager a Confirmation substantially in the form set out in Annexure 1 (or in such other form as may be agreed between Party A, Party B and the Manager) and Party B and the Manager must promptly
then confirm the accuracy of and sign and return, or request the correction of, such Confirmation. In the absence of manifest error where Party B or the Manager fails to confirm the accuracy of or request the correction of a Confirmation within
three Business Days after it was sent, the terms of a Confirmation will be binding on and conclusive against Party B. Delivery of a Confirmation is effected whether a party uses facsimile, an electronic messaging system or telex and irrespective of
the form of delivery used by the other party to confirm the terms of the relevant Transaction. The requirement of this Agreement that the parties exchange Confirmations shall for all purposes be satisfied by following the procedure set out in this

(a)
 any Related Body Corporate of the Recipient which acts as custodian or Security Trustee of the Assets of the Series Trust, of the Seller Trust or of

obligations under the Transaction Documents. Any party may decline to perform any obligation under the Transaction Documents to the extent that it forms the view, in its reasonable opinion, that notwithstanding that it has taken all action to comply

Party) from any confidentiality, privacy or general law obligations that a Released Party would otherwise owe to it in respect of this Agreement and to the extent to which it is able, any applicable confidentiality and privacy laws, but only to
the extent that the existence of these obligations or laws would otherwise prevent a Released Party from providing any information or documents requested in accordance with this clause or any similar clause in any other Transaction Document.

(a)
 Party A acknowledges that for so long as Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited is required to file Exchange Act Reports, Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited is
required under Regulation AB to disclose certain information set forth in Regulation AB regarding Party A or its group of affiliated entities, if applicable, depending on the aggregate significance percentage of this Agreement and any other

Local Business Day after the date of such determination, the Manager may request Party A to provide the relevant Swap Financial Disclosure by making a Swap Financial Disclosure Request. Thereafter, the Manager shall inform Party A no later than ten

specified in Part 5.B(13)(c) of this Schedule (subject to the issuance of a Rating Notification by the Manager).   


 
(e)
 The parties agree that, if permitted by Regulation AB, any required Swap Financial Disclosure may be provided by Party A by incorporation by
reference from reports filed by Party A pursuant to the Exchange Act. The parties agree that, if Swap Financial Disclosure is provided by Party A as set forth in the first sentence of this Part 5.B(13)(e), each relevant person (including without

contain any required Swap Financial Disclosure. The parties also agree that, if Swap Financial Disclosure is provided by Party A as set forth in the first sentence of this Part 5.B(13)(e), each relevant person (including without limitation any

Party A Indemnified Persons) and shall hold each of them harmless from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including legal fees and reasonable expenses) to which any of them may become subject, under
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon: 
 


 
(i)
 any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Swap Financial Disclosure provided by Party A;
  


 
(ii)
 any omission or alleged omission to state in the Swap Financial Disclosure provided by Party A a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or   


 
(iii)
 any failure by Party A to provide Party B or the Manager with the relevant Swap Financial Disclosure when and as required under this Part 5.B(13);

the relevant Swap Financial Disclosure by the other entity to Party B or the Manager.   


 
  
 The provisions of this Part 5.B(13)(f) shall not limit whatever rights Party B or the Manager may have under other provisions of this Agreement, the

 any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Preliminary Prospectus or Final Prospectus, other than any
Swap Financial Disclosure provided by Party A; or

damages or liabilities (including legal fees and reasonable expenses) to which any of them may become subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any failure by such party to deliver or otherwise distribute any Swap Financial Disclosure in the substantively identical form provided to any of them by Party A or as modified with Party As written
consent.   


 
  
 The provisions of this Part 5.B(13)(h) shall not limit whatever rights Party A may have under other provisions of this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents or otherwise, whether in equity or at law, such as an action for damages, specific performance or injunctive relief.   


 
(i)

or alleged omission referred to in Part 5.B(13)(g)(ii) or any failure to deliver or distribute referred to in Part 5.B(13)(h) constitute the fraud, negligence or wilful default of Party B for the purposes of this Agreement, including without
limitation Section 15(c) of this Agreement.   


(14)

 This Annex supplements, forms part of, and is subject to, the ISDA Master Agreement referred to above and
is part of its Schedule. For the purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, Sections 1(c), 2(a), 5 and 6, the credit support arrangements set out in this Annex constitute a Transaction (for which this Annex constitutes the
Confirmation).  Paragraph 1. Interpretation  Capitalised terms not otherwise defined in this Annex or elsewhere in this Agreement have the meanings specified pursuant to Paragraph 10, and all references in this Annex to Paragraphs are to Paragraphs
of this Annex. In the event of any inconsistency between this Annex and the other provisions of this Schedule, this Annex will prevail, and in the event of any inconsistency between Paragraph 11 and the other 
   
1    This document is
not intended to create a charge or other security interest over the assets transferred under its terms. Persons intending to establish a collateral arrangement based on the creation of a charge or other security interest should consider using the
ISDA Credit Support Deed (English law) or the ISDA Credit Support Annex (New York law), as appropriate.  2    This Credit Support Annex has been prepared for use with ISDA Master Agreements subject to English law. Users should consult their legal advisers as to
the proper use and effect of this form and the arrangements it contemplates. In particular, users should consult their legal advisers if they wish to have the Credit Support Annex made subject to a governing law other than English law or to have the
Credit Support Annex subject to a different governing law than that governing the rest of the ISDA Master Agreement (e.g., English law for the Credit Support Annex and New York law for the rest of the ISDA Master Agreement).

provisions of this Annex, Paragraph 11 will prevail. For the avoidance of doubt, references to
transfer in this Annex mean, in relation to cash, payment and, in relation to other assets, delivery.  Paragraph 2. Credit
Support Obligations  (a)      Delivery Amount. Subject to Paragraphs 3 and 4,
upon a demand made by the Transferee on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Delivery Amount for that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Transferors Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Transferor will transfer to the Transferee
Eligible Credit Support having a Value as of the date of transfer at least equal to the applicable Delivery Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 11(b)(iii)(D)). Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(b), the Delivery Amount
applicable to the Transferor for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which: 
(i)      the Credit Support Amount 
exceeds  (ii)      the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferors Credit Support Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any prior Return
Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date).  (b)      Return Amount. Subject to Paragraphs 3 and 4, upon a demand made by the Transferor on or promptly following a Valuation Date, if the Return Amount for
that Valuation Date equals or exceeds the Transferees Minimum Transfer Amount, then the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor Equivalent Credit Support specified by the Transferor in that demand having a Value as of the date of transfer
as close as practicable to the applicable Return Amount (rounded pursuant to Paragraph 11(b)(iii)(D)) and the Credit Support Balance will, upon such transfer, be reduced accordingly. Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(b), the Return
Amount applicable to the Transferee for any Valuation Date will equal the amount by which: 
(i)      the Value as of that Valuation Date of the Transferors Credit Support
Balance (adjusted to include any prior Delivery Amount and to exclude any prior Return Amount, the transfer of which, in either case, has not yet been completed and for which the relevant Settlement Day falls on or after such Valuation Date)
 exceeds  (ii)      the Credit Support Amount.  Paragraph 3. Transfers,
Calculations and Exchanges  (a)      Transfers. All transfers under this Annex
of any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support, Interest Amount or Equivalent Distributions shall be made in accordance with the instructions of the Transferee or Transferor, as applicable, and shall be made: 
(i)      in the case of cash, by transfer into one or more bank accounts specified by the
recipient; 
  ISDA®

(ii)      in the case of certificated
securities which cannot or which the parties have agreed will not be delivered by book-entry, by delivery in appropriate physical form to the recipient or its account accompanied by any duly executed instruments of transfer, transfer tax stamps and
any other documents necessary to constitute a legally valid transfer of the transferring partys legal and beneficial title to the recipient; and  (iii)      in the case of securities which the parties have agreed will be delivered by book-entry, by the giving of written instructions (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, instructions given by telex, facsimile transmission or electronic messaging system) to the relevant depository institution or other entity specified by the recipient, together with a written copy of the instructions to the recipient,
sufficient, if complied with, to result in a legally effective transfer of the transferring partys legal and beneficial title to the recipient.  Subject to Paragraph 4 and unless otherwise specified, if a demand for the transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support is received by the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer
will be made not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day relating to the date such demand is received; if a demand is received after the Notification Time, then the relevant transfer will be made not later than the close of business
on the Settlement Day relating to the day after the date such demand is received. 
(b)      Calculations. All calculations of Value and Exposure for purposes of Paragraphs 2
and 4(a) will be made by the relevant Valuation Agent as of the relevant Valuation Time. The Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) of its calculations not later than the Notification Time on
the Local Business Day following the applicable Valuation Date (or, in the case of Paragraph 4(a), following the date of calculation).  (c)      Exchanges. 
(i)      Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11, the Transferor may on any Local
Business Day by notice inform the Transferee that it wishes to transfer to the Transferee Eligible Credit Support specified in that notice (the New Credit Support) in exchange for certain Eligible Credit Support (the Original
Credit Support) specified in that notice comprised in the Transferors Credit Support Balance. 
(ii)      If the Transferee notifies the Transferor that it has consented to the proposed
exchange, (A) the Transferor will be obliged to transfer the New Credit Support to the Transferee on the first Settlement Day following the date on which it receives notice (which may be oral telephonic notice) from the Transferee of its
consent and (B) the Transferee will be obliged to transfer to the Transferor Equivalent Credit Support in respect of the Original Credit Support not later than the Settlement Day following the date on which the Transferee receives the New
Credit Support, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(d) (the Exchange Date); provided that the Transferee will only be obliged to transfer Equivalent Credit Support with a Value as of the date of transfer as close as
practicable to, but in any event not more than, the Value of the New Credit Support as of that date.

Paragraph 4. Dispute Resolution 
(a)      Disputed Calculations or Valuations. If a party (a Disputing Party)
reasonably disputes (I) the Valuation Agents calculation of a Delivery Amount or a Return Amount or (II) the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit Support or Equivalent Credit Support, then: 
(1)      the Disputing Party will notify the other party and the Valuation Agent (if the
Valuation Agent is not the other party) not later than the close of business on the Local Business Day following, in the case of (I) above, the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2 or, in the case of (II) above, the date of
transfer;  (2)      in the case of (I) above, the appropriate party will
transfer the undisputed amount to the other party not later than the close of business on the Settlement Day following the date that the demand is received under Paragraph 2; 
(3)      the parties will consult with each other in an attempt to resolve the dispute; and
 (4)      if they fail to resolve the dispute by the Resolution Time, then:
 (i)      in the case of a dispute involving a Delivery Amount or Return
Amount, unless otherwise specified in Paragraph 11(c), the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Exposure and the Value as of the Recalculation Date by:  (A)      utilising any calculations of that part of the Exposure attributable to the Transactions that the parties have agreed are not in dispute; 
(B)      calculating that part of the Exposure attributable to the Transactions in dispute
by seeking four actual quotations at mid-market from Reference Market-makers for purposes of calculating Market Quotation, and taking the arithmetic average of those obtained; provided that if four
quotations are not available for a particular Transaction, then fewer than four quotations may be used for that Transaction, and if no quotations are available for a particular Transaction, then the Valuation Agents original calculations will
be used for the Transaction; and  (C)      utilising the procedures specified
in Paragraph 11(e)(ii) for calculating the Value, if disputed, of the outstanding Credit Support Balance; 
(ii)      in the case of a dispute involving the Value of any transfer of Eligible Credit
Support or Equivalent Credit Support, the Valuation Agent will recalculate the Value as of the date of transfer pursuant to Paragraph 11(e)(ii).  Following a recalculation pursuant to this Paragraph, the Valuation Agent will notify each party (or the other party, if the Valuation Agent is a party) as soon as possible but in any event not later than
the Notification Time on the Local Business Day following the Resolution Time. The appropriate party will, upon demand following such notice given by the Valuation Agent or a resolution pursuant to (3) above and subject to Paragraph 3(a), make
the appropriate transfer.

(b)      No Event of Default. The failure by a
party to make a transfer of any amount which is the subject of a dispute to which Paragraph 4(a) applies will not constitute an Event of Default for as long as the procedures set out in this Paragraph 4 are being carried out. For the avoidance of
doubt, upon completion of those procedures, Section 5(a)(i) of this Agreement will apply to any failure by a party to make a transfer required under the final sentence of Paragraph 4(a) on the relevant due date. 
Paragraph 5. Transfer of Title, No Security Interest, Distributions and Interest Amount 
(a)      Transfer of Title. Each party agrees that all right, title and interest in and to
any Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount which it transfers to the other party under the terms of this Annex shall vest in the recipient free and clear of any liens, claims, charges or
encumbrances or any other interest of the transferring party or of any third person (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system).  (b)      No Security Interest. Nothing in this Annex is intended to create or does create in favour of either party any mortgage, charge, lien, pledge,
encumbrance or other security interest in any cash or other property transferred by one party to the other party under the terms of this Annex.  (c)      Distributions and Interest Amount.  (i)      Distributions. The Transferee will transfer to the Transferor not later than the Settlement Day following each Distributions Date cash, securities or
other property of the same type, nominal value, description and amount as the relevant Distributions (Equivalent Distributions) to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by the
Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose). 
(ii)      Interest Amount. Unless otherwise specified in Paragraph
11(f)(iii), the Transferee will transfer to the Transferor at the times specified in Paragraph 11(f)(ii) the relevant Interest Amount to the extent that a Delivery Amount would not be created or increased by the transfer, as calculated by the
Valuation Agent (and the date of calculation will be deemed a Valuation Date for this purpose).  Paragraph 6. Default 
If an Early Termination Date is designated or deemed to occur as a result of an Event of Default in relation to a party, an amount equal
to the Value of the Credit Support Balance, determined as though the Early Termination Date were a Valuation Date, will be deemed to be an Unpaid Amount due to the Transferor (which may or may not be the Defaulting Party) for purposes of
Section 6(e). For the avoidance of doubt, if Market Quotation is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Market Quotation determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction constituted by this
Annex will be deemed to be zero, and, if Loss is the applicable payment measure for purposes of Section 6(e), then the Loss determined under Section 6(e) in relation to the Transaction will be limited to the Unpaid Amount representing the
Value of the Credit Support Balance.

Paragraph 7. Representation  Each party represents to the other party (which representation will be deemed to be repeated as of each date on which it transfers Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent
Distributions) that it is the sole owner of or otherwise has the right to transfer all Eligible Credit Support, Equivalent Credit Support or Equivalent Distributions it transfers to the other party under this Annex, free and clear of any security
interest, lien, encumbrance or other restriction (other than a lien routinely imposed on all securities in a relevant clearance system). 
Paragraph 8. Expenses 
Each party will pay its own costs and expenses (including any stamp, transfer or similar transaction tax or duty payable on any transfer
it is required to make under this Annex) in connection with performing its obligations under this Annex, and neither party will be liable for any such costs and expenses incurred by the other party. 
Paragraph 9. Miscellaneous  (a)      Default Interest. Other than in the case of an amount which is the subject of a dispute under Paragraph 4(a), if a Transferee fails to make, when due,
any transfer of Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or the Interest Amount, it will be obliged to pay the Transferor (to the extent permitted under applicable law) an amount equal to interest at the Default Rate multiplied by the
Value on the relevant Valuation Date of the items of property that were required to be transferred, from (and including) the date that the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount were required to be transferred to (but
excluding) the date of transfer of the Equivalent Credit Support, Equivalent Distributions or Interest Amount. This interest will be calculated on the basis of daily compounding and the actual number of days elapsed. 
(b)      Good Faith and Commercially Reasonable Manner. Performance of all obligations under
this Annex, including, but not limited to, all calculations, valuations and determinations made by either party, will be made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner. 
(c)      Demands and Notices. All demands and notices given by a party under this Annex will
be given as specified in Section 12 of this Agreement.  (d)      Specifications of
Certain Matters. Anything referred to in this Annex as being specified in Paragraph 11 also may be specified in one or more Confirmations or other documents and this Annex will be construed accordingly.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
