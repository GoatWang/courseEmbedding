For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

IrwinDentist4 reviewsRatings for Dr. Spencer E. Schwartz 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Schwartz is one of the best dentists I've had the pleasure of shadowing. I shadowed at his practice as a student for a few months and was blown away by how thorough and detail oriented he is in all of his procedures. He makes sure the patient is always aware of the procedure and cost. He knows a lot about insurance and insurance policies and will make sure you get your money's worth!! Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted April 8, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Schwartz is the best dentist I know! He's extremely thorough in his examinations and gives you all your options. He takes pictures of everything going on and takes the time to explain exactly what's wrong and why. As a patient, you can tell he really has your best interest at heart. He's very detailed in his work and does everything in his power to make the procedure successful. Also, I've never seen a dentist administer a shot as painlessly as Dr. Schwartz. His attention to detail is incredible! Extremely professional. Using the laser is also huge advantage you won't get in other offices (painless!). I definitely recommend him! You'll get your money's worth! Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted April 3, 2017 1Staff 4Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeWell where do I start: the dentist himself had a 15 minute conversation to me about how bad my insurance is and how he gets paid a flat fee. He didn't seem to do a dental exam because he "won't get paid" I told him this is what I have from my company and if he didn't like it why take this insurance? I went to this at this specificity time because my filling had fallen out. I asked him to fix it since it looked like my tooth would crack if he didn't. He then proceeded to lecture me how he can't do it because it's another persons work. He can't fix someone else mistake, -according to him. Well this filling was done 15 years prior so it wasn't a mistake and I think it's highly unprofessional to discuss payment issues with a client. Not only did he seem like a "fake dentist" because he seemed like he should of been a professor instead of a dentist but he had a suit on with several holes in the arm and leg. It seemed as though it was from a thrift shop. I actually googled him after the visit to make sure this was really him. Sketchy man and sketchy office. Don't waste ur time. Go elsewhere please Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted December 25, 2016 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI'm so grateful to Dr. Schwartz & his staff. I've been a patient there for a few years now. Most recently bridgework my other dentist had done was no good. I'd only had the bridge for a few years. Now I'm out of work and needed major work done. His staff helped me get CareCredit and was very helpful with the process. Also my other dentist connected the teeth and they looked very fake. Dr. Schwartz made individual crowns for the from teeth and was able to save my teeth. The color is better and they look more real than the ones I had before. What a difference. Dr. Schwartz was very thorough & very patient. The work wasn't cheap but I felt like he really cared about my interests. Even after cementing the crowns he said if I wanted any changes after 30 days he'd help me. But the work was good and my wife liked it too. My smile just feels so much more natural than before. I recommend Dr. SchwartzWas this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted June 1, 2015 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeI just left Dr. schwartz's office after a terrible customer service experience. As a new patient, in scheduling a routine cleaning appointment it was not communicated to me by the receptionist that a "consultation" by the dentist was required prior to cleaning my teeth. I received no confirmation of my appointment prior to today even though over the phone I was told I would receive one by email. Even though the office was supposed to open at 9am, there was no answer to my calls or the voice message I left between 9 and 9:30am. So after showing up early, I waited in the waiting area for 45 minutes while the receptionist ate her breakfast and made some personal phone calls. When I was finally called into the office by the hygienist, I was told that the dentist was not going to come in today and that they would need to take x rays for him to review and I would need to schedule a follow up appointment for my cleaning. After explaining how inconvenienced I was having called out of work for this appointment I was merely told that this was their policy. No apology, no effort to even try and fix the situation. I left and will be finding a new dentist. I have no idea whether Dr. Schwartz is a good dentist. But from the quality of the staff he hires and the way his office is run, I cannot recommend using him.Was this rating useful? 3 flag | Submitted May 22, 2015 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI highly highly highly would recommend Dr.Schwartz to anyone. My front tooth broke off completely. Only the root at the gum was there. I thought it was hopeless, but he was able to put a brand new tooth on there in an hour. He didn't cause me any pain either. I was very comfortable with him and his staff. They're all very nice.Dr. Schwartz also explained everything to me and showed me examples of his work. He really helped me understand what he was doing and what my options were. I'm still amazed he was able to build a tooth up from nothing. Also, they got me in right away. Thank you so much Dr. Schwartz for saving my tooth & smile.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted January 29, 2015 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI was in such pain. I went to this lady dentist. She looked at my X-Ray and said I needed an extraction. But I didn't want to lose my tooth. So I called my insurance and they signed me with Dr.Schwartz. He did a very careful exam. He told me my tooth could be saved and explained it well. He shows me pictures of what had to be done and that really helped me understand what was going on. Dr.Schwartz did a root canal and filled my tooth. He did a great job- no more pain :-). I brought my kids to Dr. Schwartz and would recommend him to anyone. The staff is really nice too. Very friendly. I was very impressed by the equipment he had too. Very up to date.Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted September 3, 2014 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI chipped my front teeth and visited two other offices. They told me I had to get crowns which wouldnt have been covered by my insurance. Dr. Schwartz said I could just bond them. He did the bonding and they have stayed in ever since. Ive been going to his office ever since. He also did this laser treatment on my gums to make my teeth look better. It didnt hurt at all. I take my 2 children too. They've never had a cavity. Dr. S also takes lots of pictures on the computer to show me what he's doing. He explains it very well and he never rushes. They always get in touch with me to let me know when its time for my 6 month check up. Pon and Annette are very nice too. They treat everyone nicely.Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted June 11, 2014 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI've been Dr. Schwartz's patient for years now. Any patient would be lucky to have a dentist like Dr. Schwartz. He keeps up-to-date, very thorough, and does excellent work. He does laser work which I found very impressive. He did implant surgery on me and I barely felt any discomfort. He also uses a camera while working and explains everything to me. He really likes for me to understand what he's doing. He also told me all my choices. I got implants which cost lots of money and my insurance barely paid anything. The thing is he wasn't after money. He told me I could have my teeth replaced with something very simple that my insurance would have covered. I don't know too many dentists and doctors that are that up front with patients. His staff is very nice and they've been with him the whole time he's been there. That says lots about him too. I recommend all my friends & family see Dr. SchwartzWas this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted June 6, 2014 3Staff 3Punctuality 3Helpfulness 1KnowledgeI went to him for a checkup and he decided that I had one cavity but wanted to redo all my old fillings since they were old and silver. Stupid me listened. The next visit he was cavity filling happy, and when I felt a pain he said "oh, I don't know why you feel the pain, but." he continued his work and on the other side realized I needed a root canal. It took him many tries to finish filing the fillings there was no way I was going to let him do a root canal. I still feel he did a lousy job on at least one of the fillings...I would NEVER go back to him and wish my insurance would NOT pay! since I probably have to get it refilled or something! LOUSY dentist. I wish I saw these reviews before I went to him.Was this rating useful? 3 flag | Submitted July 3, 2013 Rate this DoctorDr. Spencer E.

YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksFind a Local DoctorTop Doctors of All SpecialtiesQuality Care is Our Top Prioritywww.services-connect.com(855) 605-7074Call for an AppointmentAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. Schwartz, Courtney A1204 W 18th StSpencer, IA 51301(712) 264-8829Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Schwartz Chiropractic3301 Highway 71 Ste 1Spirit Lake, IA 51360(712) 336-4848Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection3. Schwartz Chiropractic Acupuncture Clinic3004 Main StEmmetsburg, IA 50536(712) 852-8282AcupunctureBusinesses in related categories to Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection4. Fisher Family Chiropractic202 Grand Ave Ste 2Spencer, IA 51301(712) 262-7868Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Zylstra Dennis Dennis J1018 Grand AveSpencer, IA 51301(712) 262-4346Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection6. Rabel, Erin R1204 W 18th StSpencer, IA 51301(712) 264-8829Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection7. DR REX J Jones Doctor1025 5th Ave SESpencer, IA 51301(712) 262-3517Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection8. Stanley, Brent1723 Highway BlvdSpencer, IA 51301(712) 262-5510Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection9. Mc Carthy Chiropractic1900 Grand AveSpencer, IA 51301(712) 262-5510Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection10. Malmstrom, Leah Marie1019 S Grand AveSpencer, IA 51301(712) 580-3294Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection11. Kressin, Elizabeth C1025 5th Ave SESpencer, IA 51301(712) 262-3517Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection12. Chiropractic Arts ClinicHwy 18 ESpencer, IA 51301(712) 262-3517Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection13. Zylstra, Dennis J1203 W 11th StSpencer, IA 51301(712) 262-5749Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection14. Therapeutic Massage Center1210 W 18th StSpencer, IA 51301(712) 262-7252Massage TherapistsMassage ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection15. Burns Chiropractic Center(1)1210 W 18th StSpencer, IA 51301(712) 262-7252Chiropractors & Chiropractic ServicesAmazing service!
