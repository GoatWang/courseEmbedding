SANTA CLARA, Calif., July 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Pollex, Inc. (OTCMarkets: PLLX) announced today that it has been made aware of recent trading and promotional activity concerning PLLX common stock.  The Company has been informed that the higher than average trading volume in the Company's stock may be the result of promotional activity. The Company has been informed that an email from ProTrader was sent out promoting PLLX.  The Company was not aware of this promotional activity.








Pollex states definitively that the Company, its officers, directors and, to the Company's knowledge, its controlling shareholders (i.e., shareholders owning 10% or more of the Company's securities) have not, directly or indirectly, authorized or been involved in any way (including payment to a third-party) with the creation or distribution of promotional materials; and that the Company, its officers, directors and, to the knowledge of the Company, any controlling shareholders, have not sold or purchased the Company's securities within the past 30 days.  
The Company encourages those interested in the Company to rely solely on information included in its press releases combined with its filings and disclosures made with OTCMarkets Group. The Caveat Emptor warning is mandated for 30 days, wherein a review by OTCMarkets shall take place to decide on its removal. The Company is determined to take appropriate measures in this time to satisfy without delay, any and all concerns which brought on the label. We thank OTCMarkets for their openness and consideration to the investors of Pollex.
