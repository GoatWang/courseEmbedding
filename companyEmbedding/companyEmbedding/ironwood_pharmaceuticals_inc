					Full Description



Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc., incorporated on January 5, 1998, is a biotechnology company. The Company is advancing product opportunities in areas of unmet need, including irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS C), and chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), hyperuricemia associated with uncontrolled gout, uncontrolled gastroesophageal reflux disease (uncontrolled GERD), and vascular and fibrotic diseases. The Company operates in human therapeutics business segment. The Company's product, linaclotide, is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS C or CIC in the United States under the trademarked name LINZESS, and is available to adult men and women suffering from IBS C in certain European countries under the trademarked name CONSTELLA. Linaclotide is being developed and commercialized in other parts of the world by certain of its partners. It is also advancing IW-3718, a gastric retentive formulation of a bile acid sequestrant with the potential to provide symptomatic relief in patients with uncontrolled GERD.The Company manages its global supply and distribution of linaclotide and lesinurad through a combination of contract manufacturers and collaboration partners. ZURAMPIC is approved for use in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI), for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients who have not achieved target serum uric acid (sUA), levels with a XOI alone. The Company is engaged in the discovery and development of linaclotide to advance development programs, including IW-1973 and IW-1701, targeting soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC). The Company is advancing two linaclotide colonic release formulations: Linaclotide colonic release-1 (CR1), which is a second generation product candidate with the potential to improve abdominal pain relief in adult IBS C patients, and Linaclotide colonic release-2 (CR2), which is a product candidate with the potential to improve abdominal pain in patients with additional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, where lower abdominal pain is a predominant symptom, such as non-constipation subtypes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).The Company together with its partner is exploring development opportunities to enhance the clinical profile of LINZESS by studying linaclotide in additional indications and populations to assess its potential to treat various GI conditions. It is also evaluating linaclotide as a potential treatment of the GI dysfunction associated with opioid induced constipation (OIC). As of December 31, 2016, the Company together with its partner had initiated two Phase II clinical pediatric studies in IBS C patients age 7 to 17 and functional constipation patients age 6 to 17. The Company has initiated a Phase IIb clinical study of IW-3718 in patients with uncontrolled GERD. The Company is developing DUZALLO, a fixed-dose combination product of lesinurad and allopurinol, an XOI, which is included under the Lesinurad License. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review a new drug application (NDA) for DUZALLO for the treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with uncontrolled gout.The Company's sGC candidate, IW-1973, is targeting diabetic complications resulting from vascular dysfunction and fibrosis, such as resistant hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. The Company has initiated a Phase IIa open-label, placebo-controlled clinical study of IW 1973 in patients with Type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The Phase IIa study is designed to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of IW-1973 across multiple doses, as well as to explore its effect on biomarkers. The Company has initiated a Phase IIa randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, single dose clinical study of IW 1701 designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of IW 1701 in patients with Type II achalasia.The Company competes with Takeda Pharmaceuticals Limited, Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Mylan N.V., Takeda Pharmaceuticals Americas, Inc. and Sucampo AG.

About our name



About our name
Ironwood has always taken the long view: we hope to grow substantial value and, one step at a time, earn the right to build an enduring pharmaceutical company that helps people lead better lives. So we named ourselves after the ironwood tree, which can live for thousands of years in the harshest desert, creating a shaded microclimate in which life thrives. We also like that the word "ironwood" is both hard and soft. Iron like science, is undeniable and strong. Wood, like artistry and humanity, is flexible, adaptive and versatile. The two words together represent our passion for the art and science of making medicines.

Being a shareholder of Ironwood is about more than owning our shares, it's about being an owner of our business. We want you to understand our decisions and actions, and we will strive to effectively communicate the opportunities and risks involved in our business at each step along the way.
Among Ironwood's shareholders are our own employees, and this ownership mentality influences our operations. Ironwoodians are careful stewards of the company's resources, whether making a go/no-go decision on a discovery program or booking travel to a conference. Every program is challenged to earn its way forward, and every employee is challenged to earn the right to pursue the goal we all - employees and other shareholders alike - aspire to achieve: making medicines that help people lead better lives.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
In 2008, Microbia, Inc. changed its name to Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[2]
Research and products[edit]
Linaclotide[edit]
This principal product of Ironwood Pharmaceuticals was approved by the US FDA in August 2012, and reached the US market in December 2012. The drug is focused on treating irritable bowel syndrome and related symptoms, which according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) affects around 20% of Americans. Linaclotide is estimated to reach blockbuster status in around the year 2021, based on the forecast of market research firm Decision Resources.[3]
IW-9179[edit]
The company is also doing research on treatment for painful disorders of the small intestine, and has an early-stage product called IW-9179.[4] The drug has just passed Phase 2a study in 2013, and showed effects in treating Functional Dyspepsia (FD).[5]
BNC210 / IW-2143[edit]
BNC210 is an anxiolytic that Ironwood licensed and performed R&D on. It was abandoned November 2014.
Corporate affairs[edit]
Patent notice[edit]
In February 2014, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals was issued allowance by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to apply a patent on Linzess and will be protect through 2031. The patented method aims at achieving stable condition of the drug at room temperature and can dissolve in stomach with capsule and suitable for oral dosing.[6] This is another step forward in research and experiments based on Linaclotide usage.

Careers, not jobs



Careers, not jobs
Every employee at Ironwood has the opportunity to have an impact and is expected to take full advantage of that opportunity. We share a responsibility to build and grow this company, and we have open-mic meetings, open-door policies and an open-access social intranet to encourage everyone to contribute. We expect people to take initiative, and we train everyone, at every level, to be a leader. We know that working well together is the only way we’ll have a chance at overcoming the many hurdles along the path to making medicines, and we seek out people who thrive in a collaborative environment. Once we find those people, we support their aspirations: we’ve had bench scientists move into a variety of positions including regulatory and facilities, and we’ve helped finance experts transition to operations and formulation scientists move into manufacturing. We’re passionate about our business, and we encourage our colleagues to follow their passion across job descriptions or departments.
