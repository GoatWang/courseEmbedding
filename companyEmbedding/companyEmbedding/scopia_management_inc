The system is capable of dual 1080p/60fps live video content, HD Audio, H.264, Scalable Video Coding (SVC), along with iPad multi-touch control.[4] The XT5000 system also automatically scales bandwidth in unpredictable network environments during the video conferencing.[5] The Scopia XT5000 systems include the 5200 Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) carrier grade systems (5230 and 5215 systems), and the XT5100 systems (5120, 5115, 5110, and 5105).

History[edit]
On 30 April 2012 shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision by Avaya for about $230 million.[1][2] Plans were announced in June to integrated Radvision products with the Avaya Aura Unified Communication systems.[3]
XT5000 room systems[edit]
The Scopia XT5000 is a unified communication video conferencing system with many video conferencing endpoint options. The system is capable of dual 1080p/60fps live video content, HD Audio, H.264, Scalable Video Coding (SVC), along with iPad multi-touch control.[4] The XT5000 system also automatically scales bandwidth in unpredictable network environments during the video conferencing.[5] The Scopia XT5000 systems include the 5200 Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) carrier grade systems (5230 and 5215 systems), and the XT5100 systems (5120, 5115, 5110, and 5105).
Awards[edit]

Editor’s Choice Award for achievement in 2009 from industry analyst Telepresence and Videoconferencing Insight Newsletter[6][7]
2012 Frost & Sullivan New Product Innovation Award [5][8]
JITC Certified[9][10][11]

XT4200 room system[edit]
High Definition video communications. The features include 720p/60fps live video and content, HD audio, H.264 High Profile and Scalable Video Coding, dual display support and a wide angle Pan–tilt–zoom (PTZ) camera.[12][13]
Desktop and mobile[edit]
The desktop software is compatible with both Microsoft Windows and Mac systems, and works with the web browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Google Chrome.[14] The system uses H.323 and SIP standards to inter-operate with other video conferencing systems.[14] Scalable Video Coding insures performance over congested networks without affecting other users.[15] Scopia Content Slider allows the Scopia Desktop User can go back to the previous slides during a presentation.
Scopia Mobile allows HD video conferencing from mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone iPod and Android[16] Wireless connection speeds over cell systems varies greatly and NetSense optimizes the conference session as it monitors the connection quality, dynamically changing from HD video to whatever the connection can support as needed.[17]

History[edit]
On 30 April 2012 shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision by Avaya for about $230 million.[1][2] Plans were announced in June to integrated Radvision products with the Avaya Aura Unified Communication systems.[3]
XT5000 room systems[edit]
The Scopia XT5000 is a unified communication video conferencing system with many video conferencing endpoint options. The system is capable of dual 1080p/60fps live video content, HD Audio, H.264, Scalable Video Coding (SVC), along with iPad multi-touch control.[4] The XT5000 system also automatically scales bandwidth in unpredictable network environments during the video conferencing.[5] The Scopia XT5000 systems include the 5200 Advanced Telecommunications Computing Architecture (ATCA) carrier grade systems (5230 and 5215 systems), and the XT5100 systems (5120, 5115, 5110, and 5105).
Awards[edit]

Editor’s Choice Award for achievement in 2009 from industry analyst Telepresence and Videoconferencing Insight Newsletter[6][7]
2012 Frost & Sullivan New Product Innovation Award [5][8]
JITC Certified[9][10][11]

XT4200 room system[edit]
High Definition video communications. The features include 720p/60fps live video and content, HD audio, H.264 High Profile and Scalable Video Coding, dual display support and a wide angle Pan–tilt–zoom (PTZ) camera.[12][13]
Desktop and mobile[edit]
The desktop software is compatible with both Microsoft Windows and Mac systems, and works with the web browsers: Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Google Chrome.[14] The system uses H.323 and SIP standards to inter-operate with other video conferencing systems.[14] Scalable Video Coding insures performance over congested networks without affecting other users.[15] Scopia Content Slider allows the Scopia Desktop User can go back to the previous slides during a presentation.
Scopia Mobile allows HD video conferencing from mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone iPod and Android[16] Wireless connection speeds over cell systems varies greatly and NetSense optimizes the conference session as it monitors the connection quality, dynamically changing from HD video to whatever the connection can support as needed.[17]

Tips for Searching Avaya Support

A good query consists of three things:

Product or Category
Issue / Symptom / Procedure
General Details

 Enclose exact words or phrases in double quotes. Include plus (+) to require words, minus (--) to exclude words, and OR between words. i.e. forwarding OR coverage + "all calls"-- remote
 
Don't include "special" characters in your search (i.e. &, <, >, *, $, / ,\, ....)
 
The more exact the phrases are to the actual title or string of text in a document, the better the results
