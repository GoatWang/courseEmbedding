                                Tiger Towel Wins over Super Bowl Audiences in Canada!
Mar 14, 2016


                                We all know how many eyeballs the “big game” draws in North America. But it can be argued that just as many of those eyes are there for the commercials as well. This year Bell media and Toronto based research firm Brainsights wanted to see if that’s true and which ads garnered the most attention.
                                More >>


                                    Bell Media and Brainsights recorded the brain activity of 54 Canadian adults as they watched the game. Brainsights used portable brain wave readers, or electroencephalograms for the experiment. Participants were measured in two pubs so as to capture their reactions in a natural viewing environment. 

Electroencephalograms scan brain wave activity every two milliseconds, measuring brainwaves and yielding a score that includes attention and alertness, emotional connection and encoding to memory.

According to the results, 14 of the top 20 ads that aired during the broadcast were from advertisers that were exclusive to the Canadian broadcast.

Here’s the exciting part, the commercial that sparked the highest levels of attention, emotional connection and memory retention, according to the research was ROYALE®’s “Tiger Towel Food Truck.” The spot had a 37% higher score than the advertising average for the CTV broadcast.

Now that’s a roaring success!

"Panthera and our partners are working tirelessly in the field to stop tiger poaching, and protect their prey and habitats across Asia, so these animals can live in the wild forever. Tiger conservation is a global issue and what tigers need to survive is for the world to care. This is why we are delighted to have ROYALE® on board to help raise awareness and support of our programs in Canada and beyond to ensure a future for wild tigers."ROYALE® Tiger Towels are available now at retailers across Canada starting at $7.99.

		As a proud partner of this conservation effort, ROYALE® will be contributing to the Fund, and will provide ongoing support to raise awareness and promote fundraising efforts.
		"The tiger is one of the world's most iconic and recognizable species but it's teetering on the brink of extinction," says Andrea Heydlauff, PANTHERA's Vice President.
		"Tiger conservation is a global issue and what tigers need to survive is for the world to care. That is why we are delighted to have ROYALE® on board to help raise awareness in Canada and beyond, and build the needed support for our programs to ensure a future for wild tigers."
		"We are very pleased that the ROYALE® Tiger Towel Cub will be an ambassador for this great cause," says Gary MacIntosh, Director of Marketing with ROYALE® Canada. "When we selected our tiger cub ambassador we were unaware of the current plight of tigers. As we learned more about conservation efforts, we felt a responsibility to assist so that future generations will be able to appreciate the majesty of these great animals."

                                Best paper towels
Jan 01, 2012


                                When it comes to slurping up spills, some paper towels really do "bring it," which is Bounty's challenge to the messy among us. Best of the 23 we tested are plain Bounty and Bounty Extra Soft. But all Bounty products aren't equal: A third version, Bounty Basic, absorbed less than its brandmates.
                                More >>


                                    We tested absorption (the weight of water that a 25-square-inch piece of paper towel could hold) and scrubbing (the number of strokes needed to tear a section of wet paper towel rubbed over a mildly abrasive surface). The best at scrubbing survived five to 10 times as many scrubbing strokes as those that tore most easily. We also assessed wet strength (force required to pull a section of wet towel apart).Prices ranged widely, from $1.46 to $5.12 per 100 square feet, but you needn't pay top dollar. Great Value (Walmart) cost $1.82 per 100 square feet and was very good; Earth Friendly Products, one of the priciest, was lowest rated of all.Bottom line. Try one of the three recommended products: Bounty, Bounty Extra Soft, Up&Up (Target) East

                                MAJESTA Trees of Knowledge
May 04, 2011


                                On May 4th MAJESTA, partnered with Tree Canada and Focus on Forests, launched their new, educative, Trees of Knowledge Competition. MAJESTA is giving one lucky Canadian school the chance to win an outdoor classroom valued at $20,000! To learn more about the competition, read the official press release below:
                                More >>


Can getting students outside help get them thinking outside the box? Can a little extra sunshine make students a little brighter? To help teachers and students experience the benefits of being outdoors, MAJESTA®, the soft and green choice for household paper products, has created its Trees of Knowledge™ program. The program invites Canadian schools to submit applications for a chance to win a complete, customized outdoor classroom, valued at $20,000.
		"Dating back as far as Sir Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity while sitting under a tree, educators and students have benefited from learning in outdoor classrooms. Spending time outside can help foster an environmental ethic among students, improve social interactions and lead to higher scores on standardized tests," says Jim Schedler, Vice President of Marketing for MAJESTA®. "We encourage all schools to visit www.majesta.com and apply to our Trees of Knowledge program. It's easy to see the benefits of incorporating time spent outdoors into the curriculum." 
		The contest is open to all Canadian schools and the deadline for applications is August 12, 2011. The winning prize is valued at $20,000 and can include things like topsoil, boulders/furniture (large rocks, logs/stumps), coniferous trees, deciduous trees, shrubs, or planters depending on the winner's proposal. As partners in the Trees of Knowledge program, Tree Canada, an organization dedicated to empowering communities to develop and maintain their green infrastructure, will provide technical support to the school. The school will also receive curriculum support through Focus on Forests, a teaching tool that provides hands-on activities and support materials for outdoor learning. 
		For a chance to win a Trees of Knowledge outdoor classroom, schools must submit:
- A completed application form, available to download at: www.majestatreesofknowledge.ca/;
- A 500 word essay on why their school is the most worthy candidate for an outdoor classroom;
- One to five photos of the school grounds, including the proposed site of the outdoor classroom;
- A landscape-site plan;
- A letter of commitment for the outdoor classroom project from the School Board.
Applications will be judged based on criteria such as the impact the classroom will have and the longevity and sustainability of the outdoor classroom project. Judges will select the finalist schools from which the ultimate winner will be chosen by online voting.
		"At MAJESTA®, we've made a commitment to sustainability. It's a priority for our brand and for our parent company J.D. Irving, Limited. We call it being ‘tree-sponsible' and have made a promise to plant three trees for every one that we use to produce MAJESTA® products," says Schedler. "We want to help our next generation get involved and learn about the benefits of the environment. An outdoor classroom is a great place to start, and plant the seed about environmental learning and stewardship." 
		About MAJESTA®:MAJESTA® is the soft and green choice for household paper products. MAJESTA® products are made from new wood fibres of trees from J.D. Irving, Limited's forests. As part of its award-winning commitment to responsible forest management, J.D. Irving, Limited plants seedlings every spring and summer to reforest the woodlands. In the past 50+ years, J.D. Irving, Limited has planted over 827 million trees. Since 2001, J.D. Irving, Limited's forests have been certified by The Sustainable Forestry Initiative Inc. ("SFI"). Our promise is: "We plant three trees for every one we use to produce MAJESTA® products." Both soft and green, MAJESTA® delivers the softness you can feel and feel good about.
		About Tree Canada:
		Tree Canada is a not-for-profit, charitable organization established in 1992. Under the direction of an 11-member volunteer Board of Directors, Tree Canada provides education, technical assistance, resources and financial support through working partnerships to encourage Canadians to plant and care for trees in rural and urban areas.
		About Focus on Forests:
		Focus on Forests provides hands-on activities and support materials to assist teachers of all grade levels. The lesson plans are well organized and designed to be easily adapted to any teaching environment or grade level. Tree Canada and the Ontario Forestry Association have formed a National Education Partnership, highlighting the value that Focus on Forests plays in introducing forests to Canadian classrooms. Together, these two groups have combined their efforts to bring a Canada-wide forest education program. This exciting new partnership is supported by Irving Tissue Corporation, the makers of MAJESTA® household paper products.

History[edit]




Original refinery on the east side of Saint John, New Brunswick


Capitalist Kenneth Colin (K.C.) Irving established Irving Oil Limited in 1924, when he was 25 years old. Using gasoline imported by rail, the first retailing location was in Bouctouche, New Brunswick. Irving moved to Saint John to open a Ford dealership and lubricants plant in 1924. The company expanded across the Maritimes through the 1930s, to Quebec in 1940, Newfoundland in 1949, and to Maine in 1972.[1]
In 1977, Irving Oil became the first Canadian oil company to offer unleaded gasoline at its retail outlets. In the late 1990s it became the first oil company in Canada and one of the first in North America to offer gasoline with very low sulphur content, a fact which was recognized by many automobile manufacturers.[2]
Due to its investment in reducing emissions, Irving Oil was one of the few energy companies in Canada to publicly support the Kyoto Accord.[3][4]
Refining[edit]

In 1960 the company partnered with Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL) to build the Irving Oil Refinery in the east end of Saint John. Irving bought out SOCAL's share of the refinery in the late 1980s and expanded the facility to become Canada's largest refinery, processing over 300,000 barrels per day (48,000 m3/d). In the late 1990s, the refinery was upgraded to create some of North America's lowest-emission petroleum.
Since 1970 the refinery has been served by the Canaport crude oil receiving terminal southeast of Saint John. In 2009 this facility was expanded to host the Canaport LNG terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG).[5]
Irving Oil announced in fall 2006 that it had purchased more land near Canaport and was examining the feasibility of constructing another 300,000-barrel (48,000 m3) refinery in the area to complement the original modernized 1960s-era refinery in the east end of Saint John; the new refinery was to be named the "Eider Rock Refinery" and was to be built under a partnership between Irving Oil and BP plc.[6] On July 24, 2009 both companies announced that they were indefinitely postponing plans to build the second refinery.[7]
Distribution[edit]

Marine[edit]
Irving Oil's core retail area is in northeast North America and is well served by a network of regional ports and harbours in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and New England - an area that is under-served by pipelines. Consequently, the company economically transports much of its petroleum products to regional distribution terminals at ports throughout the region using its own fleet of coastal tankers.
In the 1990s, Irving Oil also took delivery of several Ultra Large Crude Carriers to deliver crude oil to the Saint John refinery from production locations in Venezuela, the Persian Gulf and the North Sea.
Road[edit]
Irving Oil operates a large fleet of company-branded tanker trucks to deliver petroleum to retail locations from its Saint John refinery as well as the marine distribution terminals. Since the 1970s these semi-trailer tanker trucks were painted a distinctive golden yellow but the fleet underwent a paint scheme change in the 2000s to use white for both cab and trailer. Irving Oil's home heating fuel delivery truck fleet was similarly coloured and is undergoing a paint scheme change.
Sister company J.D. Irving Limited owns and operates RST Industries which provides road tanker transport services for Irving Oil's wholesale deliveries,[8] as well as for jet fuel, marine fuel, liquid asphalt, and other products.
Rail[edit]
Irving Oil once made extensive use of rail service to deliver petroleum from the Saint John refinery to rail-side distribution terminals throughout Atlantic Canada and Quebec. The decline in rural branch rail lines operated by Canadian National Railway and CP Rail in the 1980s and 1990s, combined with the increase of 4-lane highway construction, has seen Irving Oil eliminate practically all retail petroleum delivery by rail and the closure of many of its rail-side distribution terminals in favour of newer highway-served terminals or direct deliveries.
Irving Oil continues to make extensive use of rail service for wholesale petroleum deliveries from its Saint John refinery. Products such as propane, liquid asphalt and diesel are delivered daily to locations in Quebec and New England via New Brunswick Southern Railway, owned by sister company J.D. Irving Limited as well as by CN.

Retail network[edit]

Irving Mainway, Westville, Nova Scotia


Irving Oil operates bulk furnace oil and propane outlets in most major centres across Atlantic Canada, New England and Quebec as well as select locations in eastern Ontario, almost all of which are supplied from its Saint John refinery.
Irving Oil also operates over 900 gas stations in these jurisdictions. In recent decades, smaller stations have been closed and consolidated as newer, larger facilities are constructed - Irving owns many choice real estate locations in communities across northeastern North America, some of which are no longer used for gas retailing, and others being held in speculation of some future need. Older stations are typically franchise operations and still have automobile service and repair shops, which in recent years are branded by Meineke.
Convenience stores[edit]
Most of Irving Oil's corporate owned-and-operated stations also contain convenience stores. These locations operated as simply "Irving" stations until the late 1990s, when the "Mainway" banner ("Marché Mainway" in Quebec) was introduced; "Mainway" being a brand appropriated from one of Irving's U.S. acquisitions. By the early 2000s, 56 of the company's Quebec locations had been leased to the Couche-Tard chain and rebranded accordingly, conversely 60 of Couche-Tard's fueling stations were supplied by Irving fuels and re-branded accordingly. By the mid 2000s, Irving began to renovate and rebrand its old "Mainway" stations under the name "Bluecanoe" as part of the company's modernization plan. The Bluecanoe brand was first introduced in New England and was introduced to some stations in eastern Ontario and the Atlantic provinces; however, many others were not upgraded and retained the older name "Mainway".
On May 8, 2008, Irving announced that they would lease 252 of the "Mainway" and "Bluecanoe" retail stores at its stations in Canada and New England to Alimentation Couche-Tard, which has rebranded all of the stores as Circle K. Irving will continue to own the stations and supply their fuel, the fuel and lubricant brands at these stations will remain "Irving". Irving stations in Quebec retain the "Couche-Tard" banner for the retail stores.
Irving stations in New England often contain an Amato's eXpress, Subway, or Quiznos.
Big Stops[edit]




Irving "Big Stop" truck stop sign near Fredericton, New Brunswick


Irving Oil also operates several "Big Stops", which are truck stops featuring family restaurants, facilities for truck drivers, and convenience stores. These large stations are located at strategic locations throughout New England, the Maritimes, Quebec and Newfoundland.
They occupy several hectares near important highway interchanges and junctions and have been developed since the 1970s; some of the oldest Big Stops are still in operation with the interiors being evocative of that era. These locations, aside from their convenience store operations, continue to be operated by Irving Oil.
In the past decade, Irving Oil has opened several new Big Stops in New Brunswick to reflect the modernized and realigned arterial highway network in that province, and these facilities contain restaurants that have their own name and identity which are often reflective of the local area. The first modern Big Stop is in Salisbury, NB, and its restaurant is called "The Silver Fox"; the second one to open was in Lincoln, NB and has a restaurant called "The Blue Canoe"; the third was in Grand Falls, NB with a restaurant called "The Back Forty"; the most recent is in Enfield, NS with a restaurant called "Crossing" - the original name for the community.

Criticisms[edit]
Examples of vertical integration within the "Irving Group of Companies" (as the Irving family refers to their holdings) include the acquisition or formation of businesses along the entire chain of production, from the Irving refinery (an Irving Oil subsidiary) and its retail outlets, to the transportation subsidiaries of J.D. Irving (RST, Midland, NB Southern, Sunbury), to various construction and engineering companies that assist in building, maintaining and expanding the conglomerate's facilities. Further examples of vertical integration within the conglomerate include Industrial Security Ltd. (ISL), the wholly owned security company that guards facilities, as well as industrial suppliers such as Thornes, Universal Sales and Commercial Equipment Ltd. which provide specialty goods and services to its companies. J.D. Irving, the sister firm to Irving Oil, is a dominant forestry company in northeastern North America, growing trees, harvesting trees and producing lumber, pulp and paper, and various enhanced value products such as magazine grade paper, tissue, and personal care products. JDI also owns Brunswick News which controls most English-language newspapers in New Brunswick.
The City of Saint John, where Irving Oil is located, is closely tied to the Irving Group of Companies, which are mostly headquartered there. In 2005, Irving Oil received a controversial tax break from the municipality to develop the Canaport LNG (liquid natural gas) terminal; it was apparently negotiated one-on-one with the city's then-mayor Norm MacFarlane. The tax concessions have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.[9][10]
The rail tanker explosion in Lac Megantic, Quebec in 2013 increased awareness in Saint John of potential rail safety issues involving Irving Oil crude shipments, since the train that exploded was on its way to the Irving Oil refinery in Saint John.[11] Irving Oil’s siting of a crude oil rail terminal in an east neighbourhood of the city drew heavy criticism from environmentalists and residents.[12] Irving Oil was allowed to establish the terminal without environmental assessments. The facility has since faced complaints regarding air quality and noise.[13][14]
There was also conflict in Saint John over the proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline that was to cross through a major municipal park. However, it is unknown if there would be any health risks to the community.
The Dominion newspaper, an independent Canadian newspaper, has criticized Irving's ownership of the New Brunswick Papers, as well as the papers' journalistic integrity, particularly when reporting on companies controlled by the Irving family such as Irving Oil.[15] Even the Canadian Senate has examined the issue; a report from the Senate in 2006 on media control in Canada singled out New Brunswick because of the Irving companies' ownership of all English-language daily newspapers in the province, including the Telegraph-Journal. Senator Joan Fraser, author of the Senate report, stated, "We didn't find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick."[16] The report went further, stating, "the Irvings' corporate interests form an industrial-media complex that dominates the province" to a degree "unique in developed countries." At the Senate hearing, journalists and academics cited Irving newspapers' lack of critical reporting on the family's influential businesses.[17] In 2015 the Telegraph-Journal published editorials arguing against reconsideration of the tax concessions granted to Irving Oil, without acknowledging the conflict of interest.[18] In 2016, coverage of Saint John Common Council advocacy for higher taxation of Irving Oil's refinery was notably absent from the newspaper, despite extensive coverage in CBC and other news outlets.
There have also been accusations of Irving family political patronage, notably involving Allan Rock and Claudette Bradshaw of the Liberal Party of Canada.[19]
Incidents[edit]
The Irving Whale, an oil barge owned by Irving Oil's sister firm J.D. Irving Ltd., was carrying a cargo of 4300 tons of No. 6 fuel oil for Irving Oil when it sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on September 7, 1970, causing a large initial oil spill and subsequent leaks for the next 26 years until it was salvaged by the federal government on July 30, 1996.[20]
On January 4, 1974, 5 people were killed when an Irving Oil gas station east of the Reversing Falls Bridge in Saint John exploded after a transport truck struck a gas tank.[21]
On June 9, 1998, William Hackett, a worker at the Irving Oil Refinery, was killed when a pressurized vessel exploded.[22]
In 2000, a contractor was killed at the Irving Oil Refinery when he fell out of a cherry picker bucket.[23]
On January 30, 2008, Joseph Omer Allain, a construction worker, died at the Canaport LNG facility after falling inside a tank; Canaport LNG is a joint venture between Irving Oil and Repsol.[24]

History[edit]




Original refinery on the east side of Saint John, New Brunswick


Capitalist Kenneth Colin (K.C.) Irving established Irving Oil Limited in 1924, when he was 25 years old. Using gasoline imported by rail, the first retailing location was in Bouctouche, New Brunswick. Irving moved to Saint John to open a Ford dealership and lubricants plant in 1924. The company expanded across the Maritimes through the 1930s, to Quebec in 1940, Newfoundland in 1949, and to Maine in 1972.[1]
In 1977, Irving Oil became the first Canadian oil company to offer unleaded gasoline at its retail outlets. In the late 1990s it became the first oil company in Canada and one of the first in North America to offer gasoline with very low sulphur content, a fact which was recognized by many automobile manufacturers.[2]
Due to its investment in reducing emissions, Irving Oil was one of the few energy companies in Canada to publicly support the Kyoto Accord.[3][4]
Refining[edit]

In 1960 the company partnered with Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL) to build the Irving Oil Refinery in the east end of Saint John. Irving bought out SOCAL's share of the refinery in the late 1980s and expanded the facility to become Canada's largest refinery, processing over 300,000 barrels per day (48,000 m3/d). In the late 1990s, the refinery was upgraded to create some of North America's lowest-emission petroleum.
Since 1970 the refinery has been served by the Canaport crude oil receiving terminal southeast of Saint John. In 2009 this facility was expanded to host the Canaport LNG terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG).[5]
Irving Oil announced in fall 2006 that it had purchased more land near Canaport and was examining the feasibility of constructing another 300,000-barrel (48,000 m3) refinery in the area to complement the original modernized 1960s-era refinery in the east end of Saint John; the new refinery was to be named the "Eider Rock Refinery" and was to be built under a partnership between Irving Oil and BP plc.[6] On July 24, 2009 both companies announced that they were indefinitely postponing plans to build the second refinery.[7]
Distribution[edit]

Marine[edit]
Irving Oil's core retail area is in northeast North America and is well served by a network of regional ports and harbours in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and New England - an area that is under-served by pipelines. Consequently, the company economically transports much of its petroleum products to regional distribution terminals at ports throughout the region using its own fleet of coastal tankers.
In the 1990s, Irving Oil also took delivery of several Ultra Large Crude Carriers to deliver crude oil to the Saint John refinery from production locations in Venezuela, the Persian Gulf and the North Sea.
Road[edit]
Irving Oil operates a large fleet of company-branded tanker trucks to deliver petroleum to retail locations from its Saint John refinery as well as the marine distribution terminals. Since the 1970s these semi-trailer tanker trucks were painted a distinctive golden yellow but the fleet underwent a paint scheme change in the 2000s to use white for both cab and trailer. Irving Oil's home heating fuel delivery truck fleet was similarly coloured and is undergoing a paint scheme change.
Sister company J.D. Irving Limited owns and operates RST Industries which provides road tanker transport services for Irving Oil's wholesale deliveries,[8] as well as for jet fuel, marine fuel, liquid asphalt, and other products.
Rail[edit]
Irving Oil once made extensive use of rail service to deliver petroleum from the Saint John refinery to rail-side distribution terminals throughout Atlantic Canada and Quebec. The decline in rural branch rail lines operated by Canadian National Railway and CP Rail in the 1980s and 1990s, combined with the increase of 4-lane highway construction, has seen Irving Oil eliminate practically all retail petroleum delivery by rail and the closure of many of its rail-side distribution terminals in favour of newer highway-served terminals or direct deliveries.
Irving Oil continues to make extensive use of rail service for wholesale petroleum deliveries from its Saint John refinery. Products such as propane, liquid asphalt and diesel are delivered daily to locations in Quebec and New England via New Brunswick Southern Railway, owned by sister company J.D. Irving Limited as well as by CN.

Retail network[edit]

Irving Mainway, Westville, Nova Scotia


Irving Oil operates bulk furnace oil and propane outlets in most major centres across Atlantic Canada, New England and Quebec as well as select locations in eastern Ontario, almost all of which are supplied from its Saint John refinery.
Irving Oil also operates over 900 gas stations in these jurisdictions. In recent decades, smaller stations have been closed and consolidated as newer, larger facilities are constructed - Irving owns many choice real estate locations in communities across northeastern North America, some of which are no longer used for gas retailing, and others being held in speculation of some future need. Older stations are typically franchise operations and still have automobile service and repair shops, which in recent years are branded by Meineke.
Convenience stores[edit]
Most of Irving Oil's corporate owned-and-operated stations also contain convenience stores. These locations operated as simply "Irving" stations until the late 1990s, when the "Mainway" banner ("Marché Mainway" in Quebec) was introduced; "Mainway" being a brand appropriated from one of Irving's U.S. acquisitions. By the early 2000s, 56 of the company's Quebec locations had been leased to the Couche-Tard chain and rebranded accordingly, conversely 60 of Couche-Tard's fueling stations were supplied by Irving fuels and re-branded accordingly. By the mid 2000s, Irving began to renovate and rebrand its old "Mainway" stations under the name "Bluecanoe" as part of the company's modernization plan. The Bluecanoe brand was first introduced in New England and was introduced to some stations in eastern Ontario and the Atlantic provinces; however, many others were not upgraded and retained the older name "Mainway".
On May 8, 2008, Irving announced that they would lease 252 of the "Mainway" and "Bluecanoe" retail stores at its stations in Canada and New England to Alimentation Couche-Tard, which has rebranded all of the stores as Circle K. Irving will continue to own the stations and supply their fuel, the fuel and lubricant brands at these stations will remain "Irving". Irving stations in Quebec retain the "Couche-Tard" banner for the retail stores.
Irving stations in New England often contain an Amato's eXpress, Subway, or Quiznos.
Big Stops[edit]

Irving Oil also operates several "Big Stops", which are truck stops featuring family restaurants, facilities for truck drivers, and convenience stores. These large stations are located at strategic locations throughout New England, the Maritimes, Quebec and Newfoundland.
They occupy several hectares near important highway interchanges and junctions and have been developed since the 1970s; some of the oldest Big Stops are still in operation with the interiors being evocative of that era. These locations, aside from their convenience store operations, continue to be operated by Irving Oil.
In the past decade, Irving Oil has opened several new Big Stops in New Brunswick to reflect the modernized and realigned arterial highway network in that province, and these facilities contain restaurants that have their own name and identity which are often reflective of the local area. The first modern Big Stop is in Salisbury, NB, and its restaurant is called "The Silver Fox"; the second one to open was in Lincoln, NB and has a restaurant called "The Blue Canoe"; the third was in Grand Falls, NB with a restaurant called "The Back Forty"; the most recent is in Enfield, NS with a restaurant called "Crossing" - the original name for the community.

Criticisms[edit]
Examples of vertical integration within the "Irving Group of Companies" (as the Irving family refers to their holdings) include the acquisition or formation of businesses along the entire chain of production, from the Irving refinery (an Irving Oil subsidiary) and its retail outlets, to the transportation subsidiaries of J.D. Irving (RST, Midland, NB Southern, Sunbury), to various construction and engineering companies that assist in building, maintaining and expanding the conglomerate's facilities. Further examples of vertical integration within the conglomerate include Industrial Security Ltd. (ISL), the wholly owned security company that guards facilities, as well as industrial suppliers such as Thornes, Universal Sales and Commercial Equipment Ltd. which provide specialty goods and services to its companies. J.D. Irving, the sister firm to Irving Oil, is a dominant forestry company in northeastern North America, growing trees, harvesting trees and producing lumber, pulp and paper, and various enhanced value products such as magazine grade paper, tissue, and personal care products. JDI also owns Brunswick News which controls most English-language newspapers in New Brunswick.
The City of Saint John, where Irving Oil is located, is closely tied to the Irving Group of Companies, which are mostly headquartered there. In 2005, Irving Oil received a controversial tax break from the municipality to develop the Canaport LNG (liquid natural gas) terminal; it was apparently negotiated one-on-one with the city's then-mayor Norm MacFarlane. The tax concessions have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.[9][10]
The rail tanker explosion in Lac Megantic, Quebec in 2013 increased awareness in Saint John of potential rail safety issues involving Irving Oil crude shipments, since the train that exploded was on its way to the Irving Oil refinery in Saint John.[11] Irving Oil’s siting of a crude oil rail terminal in an east neighbourhood of the city drew heavy criticism from environmentalists and residents.[12] Irving Oil was allowed to establish the terminal without environmental assessments. The facility has since faced complaints regarding air quality and noise.[13][14]
There was also conflict in Saint John over the proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline that was to cross through a major municipal park. However, it is unknown if there would be any health risks to the community.
The Dominion newspaper, an independent Canadian newspaper, has criticized Irving's ownership of the New Brunswick Papers, as well as the papers' journalistic integrity, particularly when reporting on companies controlled by the Irving family such as Irving Oil.[15] Even the Canadian Senate has examined the issue; a report from the Senate in 2006 on media control in Canada singled out New Brunswick because of the Irving companies' ownership of all English-language daily newspapers in the province, including the Telegraph-Journal. Senator Joan Fraser, author of the Senate report, stated, "We didn't find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick."[16] The report went further, stating, "the Irvings' corporate interests form an industrial-media complex that dominates the province" to a degree "unique in developed countries." At the Senate hearing, journalists and academics cited Irving newspapers' lack of critical reporting on the family's influential businesses.[17] In 2015 the Telegraph-Journal published editorials arguing against reconsideration of the tax concessions granted to Irving Oil, without acknowledging the conflict of interest.[18] In 2016, coverage of Saint John Common Council advocacy for higher taxation of Irving Oil's refinery was notably absent from the newspaper, despite extensive coverage in CBC and other news outlets.
There have also been accusations of Irving family political patronage, notably involving Allan Rock and Claudette Bradshaw of the Liberal Party of Canada.[19]
Incidents[edit]
The Irving Whale, an oil barge owned by Irving Oil's sister firm J.D. Irving Ltd., was carrying a cargo of 4300 tons of No. 6 fuel oil for Irving Oil when it sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on September 7, 1970, causing a large initial oil spill and subsequent leaks for the next 26 years until it was salvaged by the federal government on July 30, 1996.[20]
On January 4, 1974, 5 people were killed when an Irving Oil gas station east of the Reversing Falls Bridge in Saint John exploded after a transport truck struck a gas tank.[21]
On June 9, 1998, William Hackett, a worker at the Irving Oil Refinery, was killed when a pressurized vessel exploded.[22]
In 2000, a contractor was killed at the Irving Oil Refinery when he fell out of a cherry picker bucket.[23]
On January 30, 2008, Joseph Omer Allain, a construction worker, died at the Canaport LNG facility after falling inside a tank; Canaport LNG is a joint venture between Irving Oil and Repsol.[24]

They occupy several hectares near important highway interchanges and junctions and have been developed since the 1970s; some of the oldest Big Stops are still in operation with the interiors being evocative of that era. These locations, aside from their convenience store operations, continue to be operated by Irving Oil.
In the past decade, Irving Oil has opened several new Big Stops in New Brunswick to reflect the modernized and realigned arterial highway network in that province, and these facilities contain restaurants that have their own name and identity which are often reflective of the local area. The first modern Big Stop is in Salisbury, NB, and its restaurant is called "The Silver Fox"; the second one to open was in Lincoln, NB and has a restaurant called "The Blue Canoe"; the third was in Grand Falls, NB with a restaurant called "The Back Forty"; the most recent is in Enfield, NS with a restaurant called "Crossing" - the original name for the community.




Irving corporate offices in Saint John


Criticisms[edit]
Examples of vertical integration within the "Irving Group of Companies" (as the Irving family refers to their holdings) include the acquisition or formation of businesses along the entire chain of production, from the Irving refinery (an Irving Oil subsidiary) and its retail outlets, to the transportation subsidiaries of J.D. Irving (RST, Midland, NB Southern, Sunbury), to various construction and engineering companies that assist in building, maintaining and expanding the conglomerate's facilities. Further examples of vertical integration within the conglomerate include Industrial Security Ltd. (ISL), the wholly owned security company that guards facilities, as well as industrial suppliers such as Thornes, Universal Sales and Commercial Equipment Ltd. which provide specialty goods and services to its companies. J.D. Irving, the sister firm to Irving Oil, is a dominant forestry company in northeastern North America, growing trees, harvesting trees and producing lumber, pulp and paper, and various enhanced value products such as magazine grade paper, tissue, and personal care products. JDI also owns Brunswick News which controls most English-language newspapers in New Brunswick.
The City of Saint John, where Irving Oil is located, is closely tied to the Irving Group of Companies, which are mostly headquartered there. In 2005, Irving Oil received a controversial tax break from the municipality to develop the Canaport LNG (liquid natural gas) terminal; it was apparently negotiated one-on-one with the city's then-mayor Norm MacFarlane. The tax concessions have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.[9][10]
The rail tanker explosion in Lac Megantic, Quebec in 2013 increased awareness in Saint John of potential rail safety issues involving Irving Oil crude shipments, since the train that exploded was on its way to the Irving Oil refinery in Saint John.[11] Irving Oil’s siting of a crude oil rail terminal in an east neighbourhood of the city drew heavy criticism from environmentalists and residents.[12] Irving Oil was allowed to establish the terminal without environmental assessments. The facility has since faced complaints regarding air quality and noise.[13][14]
There was also conflict in Saint John over the proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline that was to cross through a major municipal park. However, it is unknown if there would be any health risks to the community.
The Dominion newspaper, an independent Canadian newspaper, has criticized Irving's ownership of the New Brunswick Papers, as well as the papers' journalistic integrity, particularly when reporting on companies controlled by the Irving family such as Irving Oil.[15] Even the Canadian Senate has examined the issue; a report from the Senate in 2006 on media control in Canada singled out New Brunswick because of the Irving companies' ownership of all English-language daily newspapers in the province, including the Telegraph-Journal. Senator Joan Fraser, author of the Senate report, stated, "We didn't find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick."[16] The report went further, stating, "the Irvings' corporate interests form an industrial-media complex that dominates the province" to a degree "unique in developed countries." At the Senate hearing, journalists and academics cited Irving newspapers' lack of critical reporting on the family's influential businesses.[17] In 2015 the Telegraph-Journal published editorials arguing against reconsideration of the tax concessions granted to Irving Oil, without acknowledging the conflict of interest.[18] In 2016, coverage of Saint John Common Council advocacy for higher taxation of Irving Oil's refinery was notably absent from the newspaper, despite extensive coverage in CBC and other news outlets.
There have also been accusations of Irving family political patronage, notably involving Allan Rock and Claudette Bradshaw of the Liberal Party of Canada.[19]
Incidents[edit]
The Irving Whale, an oil barge owned by Irving Oil's sister firm J.D. Irving Ltd., was carrying a cargo of 4300 tons of No. 6 fuel oil for Irving Oil when it sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on September 7, 1970, causing a large initial oil spill and subsequent leaks for the next 26 years until it was salvaged by the federal government on July 30, 1996.[20]
On January 4, 1974, 5 people were killed when an Irving Oil gas station east of the Reversing Falls Bridge in Saint John exploded after a transport truck struck a gas tank.[21]
On June 9, 1998, William Hackett, a worker at the Irving Oil Refinery, was killed when a pressurized vessel exploded.[22]
In 2000, a contractor was killed at the Irving Oil Refinery when he fell out of a cherry picker bucket.[23]
On January 30, 2008, Joseph Omer Allain, a construction worker, died at the Canaport LNG facility after falling inside a tank; Canaport LNG is a joint venture between Irving Oil and Repsol.[24]

History[edit]




Original refinery on the east side of Saint John, New Brunswick


Capitalist Kenneth Colin (K.C.) Irving established Irving Oil Limited in 1924, when he was 25 years old. Using gasoline imported by rail, the first retailing location was in Bouctouche, New Brunswick. Irving moved to Saint John to open a Ford dealership and lubricants plant in 1924. The company expanded across the Maritimes through the 1930s, to Quebec in 1940, Newfoundland in 1949, and to Maine in 1972.[1]
In 1977, Irving Oil became the first Canadian oil company to offer unleaded gasoline at its retail outlets. In the late 1990s it became the first oil company in Canada and one of the first in North America to offer gasoline with very low sulphur content, a fact which was recognized by many automobile manufacturers.[2]
Due to its investment in reducing emissions, Irving Oil was one of the few energy companies in Canada to publicly support the Kyoto Accord.[3][4]
Refining[edit]

In 1960 the company partnered with Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL) to build the Irving Oil Refinery in the east end of Saint John. Irving bought out SOCAL's share of the refinery in the late 1980s and expanded the facility to become Canada's largest refinery, processing over 300,000 barrels per day (48,000 m3/d). In the late 1990s, the refinery was upgraded to create some of North America's lowest-emission petroleum.
Since 1970 the refinery has been served by the Canaport crude oil receiving terminal southeast of Saint John. In 2009 this facility was expanded to host the Canaport LNG terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG).[5]
Irving Oil announced in fall 2006 that it had purchased more land near Canaport and was examining the feasibility of constructing another 300,000-barrel (48,000 m3) refinery in the area to complement the original modernized 1960s-era refinery in the east end of Saint John; the new refinery was to be named the "Eider Rock Refinery" and was to be built under a partnership between Irving Oil and BP plc.[6] On July 24, 2009 both companies announced that they were indefinitely postponing plans to build the second refinery.[7]
Distribution[edit]

Marine[edit]
Irving Oil's core retail area is in northeast North America and is well served by a network of regional ports and harbours in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and New England - an area that is under-served by pipelines. Consequently, the company economically transports much of its petroleum products to regional distribution terminals at ports throughout the region using its own fleet of coastal tankers.
In the 1990s, Irving Oil also took delivery of several Ultra Large Crude Carriers to deliver crude oil to the Saint John refinery from production locations in Venezuela, the Persian Gulf and the North Sea.
Road[edit]
Irving Oil operates a large fleet of company-branded tanker trucks to deliver petroleum to retail locations from its Saint John refinery as well as the marine distribution terminals. Since the 1970s these semi-trailer tanker trucks were painted a distinctive golden yellow but the fleet underwent a paint scheme change in the 2000s to use white for both cab and trailer. Irving Oil's home heating fuel delivery truck fleet was similarly coloured and is undergoing a paint scheme change.
Sister company J.D. Irving Limited owns and operates RST Industries which provides road tanker transport services for Irving Oil's wholesale deliveries,[8] as well as for jet fuel, marine fuel, liquid asphalt, and other products.
Rail[edit]
Irving Oil once made extensive use of rail service to deliver petroleum from the Saint John refinery to rail-side distribution terminals throughout Atlantic Canada and Quebec. The decline in rural branch rail lines operated by Canadian National Railway and CP Rail in the 1980s and 1990s, combined with the increase of 4-lane highway construction, has seen Irving Oil eliminate practically all retail petroleum delivery by rail and the closure of many of its rail-side distribution terminals in favour of newer highway-served terminals or direct deliveries.
Irving Oil continues to make extensive use of rail service for wholesale petroleum deliveries from its Saint John refinery. Products such as propane, liquid asphalt and diesel are delivered daily to locations in Quebec and New England via New Brunswick Southern Railway, owned by sister company J.D. Irving Limited as well as by CN.

Retail network[edit]

Irving Mainway, Westville, Nova Scotia


Irving Oil operates bulk furnace oil and propane outlets in most major centres across Atlantic Canada, New England and Quebec as well as select locations in eastern Ontario, almost all of which are supplied from its Saint John refinery.
Irving Oil also operates over 900 gas stations in these jurisdictions. In recent decades, smaller stations have been closed and consolidated as newer, larger facilities are constructed - Irving owns many choice real estate locations in communities across northeastern North America, some of which are no longer used for gas retailing, and others being held in speculation of some future need. Older stations are typically franchise operations and still have automobile service and repair shops, which in recent years are branded by Meineke.
Convenience stores[edit]
Most of Irving Oil's corporate owned-and-operated stations also contain convenience stores. These locations operated as simply "Irving" stations until the late 1990s, when the "Mainway" banner ("Marché Mainway" in Quebec) was introduced; "Mainway" being a brand appropriated from one of Irving's U.S. acquisitions. By the early 2000s, 56 of the company's Quebec locations had been leased to the Couche-Tard chain and rebranded accordingly, conversely 60 of Couche-Tard's fueling stations were supplied by Irving fuels and re-branded accordingly. By the mid 2000s, Irving began to renovate and rebrand its old "Mainway" stations under the name "Bluecanoe" as part of the company's modernization plan. The Bluecanoe brand was first introduced in New England and was introduced to some stations in eastern Ontario and the Atlantic provinces; however, many others were not upgraded and retained the older name "Mainway".
On May 8, 2008, Irving announced that they would lease 252 of the "Mainway" and "Bluecanoe" retail stores at its stations in Canada and New England to Alimentation Couche-Tard, which has rebranded all of the stores as Circle K. Irving will continue to own the stations and supply their fuel, the fuel and lubricant brands at these stations will remain "Irving". Irving stations in Quebec retain the "Couche-Tard" banner for the retail stores.
Irving stations in New England often contain an Amato's eXpress, Subway, or Quiznos.
Big Stops[edit]

History[edit]




Original refinery on the east side of Saint John, New Brunswick


Capitalist Kenneth Colin (K.C.) Irving established Irving Oil Limited in 1924, when he was 25 years old. Using gasoline imported by rail, the first retailing location was in Bouctouche, New Brunswick. Irving moved to Saint John to open a Ford dealership and lubricants plant in 1924. The company expanded across the Maritimes through the 1930s, to Quebec in 1940, Newfoundland in 1949, and to Maine in 1972.[1]
In 1977, Irving Oil became the first Canadian oil company to offer unleaded gasoline at its retail outlets. In the late 1990s it became the first oil company in Canada and one of the first in North America to offer gasoline with very low sulphur content, a fact which was recognized by many automobile manufacturers.[2]
Due to its investment in reducing emissions, Irving Oil was one of the few energy companies in Canada to publicly support the Kyoto Accord.[3][4]
Refining[edit]

In 1960 the company partnered with Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL) to build the Irving Oil Refinery in the east end of Saint John. Irving bought out SOCAL's share of the refinery in the late 1980s and expanded the facility to become Canada's largest refinery, processing over 300,000 barrels per day (48,000 m3/d). In the late 1990s, the refinery was upgraded to create some of North America's lowest-emission petroleum.
Since 1970 the refinery has been served by the Canaport crude oil receiving terminal southeast of Saint John. In 2009 this facility was expanded to host the Canaport LNG terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG).[5]
Irving Oil announced in fall 2006 that it had purchased more land near Canaport and was examining the feasibility of constructing another 300,000-barrel (48,000 m3) refinery in the area to complement the original modernized 1960s-era refinery in the east end of Saint John; the new refinery was to be named the "Eider Rock Refinery" and was to be built under a partnership between Irving Oil and BP plc.[6] On July 24, 2009 both companies announced that they were indefinitely postponing plans to build the second refinery.[7]
Distribution[edit]

Marine[edit]
Irving Oil's core retail area is in northeast North America and is well served by a network of regional ports and harbours in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and New England - an area that is under-served by pipelines. Consequently, the company economically transports much of its petroleum products to regional distribution terminals at ports throughout the region using its own fleet of coastal tankers.
In the 1990s, Irving Oil also took delivery of several Ultra Large Crude Carriers to deliver crude oil to the Saint John refinery from production locations in Venezuela, the Persian Gulf and the North Sea.
Road[edit]
Irving Oil operates a large fleet of company-branded tanker trucks to deliver petroleum to retail locations from its Saint John refinery as well as the marine distribution terminals. Since the 1970s these semi-trailer tanker trucks were painted a distinctive golden yellow but the fleet underwent a paint scheme change in the 2000s to use white for both cab and trailer. Irving Oil's home heating fuel delivery truck fleet was similarly coloured and is undergoing a paint scheme change.
Sister company J.D. Irving Limited owns and operates RST Industries which provides road tanker transport services for Irving Oil's wholesale deliveries,[8] as well as for jet fuel, marine fuel, liquid asphalt, and other products.
Rail[edit]
Irving Oil once made extensive use of rail service to deliver petroleum from the Saint John refinery to rail-side distribution terminals throughout Atlantic Canada and Quebec. The decline in rural branch rail lines operated by Canadian National Railway and CP Rail in the 1980s and 1990s, combined with the increase of 4-lane highway construction, has seen Irving Oil eliminate practically all retail petroleum delivery by rail and the closure of many of its rail-side distribution terminals in favour of newer highway-served terminals or direct deliveries.
Irving Oil continues to make extensive use of rail service for wholesale petroleum deliveries from its Saint John refinery. Products such as propane, liquid asphalt and diesel are delivered daily to locations in Quebec and New England via New Brunswick Southern Railway, owned by sister company J.D. Irving Limited as well as by CN.

Retail network[edit]

Irving Mainway, Westville, Nova Scotia


Irving Oil operates bulk furnace oil and propane outlets in most major centres across Atlantic Canada, New England and Quebec as well as select locations in eastern Ontario, almost all of which are supplied from its Saint John refinery.
Irving Oil also operates over 900 gas stations in these jurisdictions. In recent decades, smaller stations have been closed and consolidated as newer, larger facilities are constructed - Irving owns many choice real estate locations in communities across northeastern North America, some of which are no longer used for gas retailing, and others being held in speculation of some future need. Older stations are typically franchise operations and still have automobile service and repair shops, which in recent years are branded by Meineke.
Convenience stores[edit]
Most of Irving Oil's corporate owned-and-operated stations also contain convenience stores. These locations operated as simply "Irving" stations until the late 1990s, when the "Mainway" banner ("Marché Mainway" in Quebec) was introduced; "Mainway" being a brand appropriated from one of Irving's U.S. acquisitions. By the early 2000s, 56 of the company's Quebec locations had been leased to the Couche-Tard chain and rebranded accordingly, conversely 60 of Couche-Tard's fueling stations were supplied by Irving fuels and re-branded accordingly. By the mid 2000s, Irving began to renovate and rebrand its old "Mainway" stations under the name "Bluecanoe" as part of the company's modernization plan. The Bluecanoe brand was first introduced in New England and was introduced to some stations in eastern Ontario and the Atlantic provinces; however, many others were not upgraded and retained the older name "Mainway".
On May 8, 2008, Irving announced that they would lease 252 of the "Mainway" and "Bluecanoe" retail stores at its stations in Canada and New England to Alimentation Couche-Tard, which has rebranded all of the stores as Circle K. Irving will continue to own the stations and supply their fuel, the fuel and lubricant brands at these stations will remain "Irving". Irving stations in Quebec retain the "Couche-Tard" banner for the retail stores.
Irving stations in New England often contain an Amato's eXpress, Subway, or Quiznos.
Big Stops[edit]

Irving Oil also operates several "Big Stops", which are truck stops featuring family restaurants, facilities for truck drivers, and convenience stores. These large stations are located at strategic locations throughout New England, the Maritimes, Quebec and Newfoundland.
They occupy several hectares near important highway interchanges and junctions and have been developed since the 1970s; some of the oldest Big Stops are still in operation with the interiors being evocative of that era. These locations, aside from their convenience store operations, continue to be operated by Irving Oil.
In the past decade, Irving Oil has opened several new Big Stops in New Brunswick to reflect the modernized and realigned arterial highway network in that province, and these facilities contain restaurants that have their own name and identity which are often reflective of the local area. The first modern Big Stop is in Salisbury, NB, and its restaurant is called "The Silver Fox"; the second one to open was in Lincoln, NB and has a restaurant called "The Blue Canoe"; the third was in Grand Falls, NB with a restaurant called "The Back Forty"; the most recent is in Enfield, NS with a restaurant called "Crossing" - the original name for the community.

Criticisms[edit]
Examples of vertical integration within the "Irving Group of Companies" (as the Irving family refers to their holdings) include the acquisition or formation of businesses along the entire chain of production, from the Irving refinery (an Irving Oil subsidiary) and its retail outlets, to the transportation subsidiaries of J.D. Irving (RST, Midland, NB Southern, Sunbury), to various construction and engineering companies that assist in building, maintaining and expanding the conglomerate's facilities. Further examples of vertical integration within the conglomerate include Industrial Security Ltd. (ISL), the wholly owned security company that guards facilities, as well as industrial suppliers such as Thornes, Universal Sales and Commercial Equipment Ltd. which provide specialty goods and services to its companies. J.D. Irving, the sister firm to Irving Oil, is a dominant forestry company in northeastern North America, growing trees, harvesting trees and producing lumber, pulp and paper, and various enhanced value products such as magazine grade paper, tissue, and personal care products. JDI also owns Brunswick News which controls most English-language newspapers in New Brunswick.
The City of Saint John, where Irving Oil is located, is closely tied to the Irving Group of Companies, which are mostly headquartered there. In 2005, Irving Oil received a controversial tax break from the municipality to develop the Canaport LNG (liquid natural gas) terminal; it was apparently negotiated one-on-one with the city's then-mayor Norm MacFarlane. The tax concessions have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.[9][10]
The rail tanker explosion in Lac Megantic, Quebec in 2013 increased awareness in Saint John of potential rail safety issues involving Irving Oil crude shipments, since the train that exploded was on its way to the Irving Oil refinery in Saint John.[11] Irving Oil’s siting of a crude oil rail terminal in an east neighbourhood of the city drew heavy criticism from environmentalists and residents.[12] Irving Oil was allowed to establish the terminal without environmental assessments. The facility has since faced complaints regarding air quality and noise.[13][14]
There was also conflict in Saint John over the proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline that was to cross through a major municipal park. However, it is unknown if there would be any health risks to the community.
The Dominion newspaper, an independent Canadian newspaper, has criticized Irving's ownership of the New Brunswick Papers, as well as the papers' journalistic integrity, particularly when reporting on companies controlled by the Irving family such as Irving Oil.[15] Even the Canadian Senate has examined the issue; a report from the Senate in 2006 on media control in Canada singled out New Brunswick because of the Irving companies' ownership of all English-language daily newspapers in the province, including the Telegraph-Journal. Senator Joan Fraser, author of the Senate report, stated, "We didn't find anywhere else in the developed world a situation like the situation in New Brunswick."[16] The report went further, stating, "the Irvings' corporate interests form an industrial-media complex that dominates the province" to a degree "unique in developed countries." At the Senate hearing, journalists and academics cited Irving newspapers' lack of critical reporting on the family's influential businesses.[17] In 2015 the Telegraph-Journal published editorials arguing against reconsideration of the tax concessions granted to Irving Oil, without acknowledging the conflict of interest.[18] In 2016, coverage of Saint John Common Council advocacy for higher taxation of Irving Oil's refinery was notably absent from the newspaper, despite extensive coverage in CBC and other news outlets.
There have also been accusations of Irving family political patronage, notably involving Allan Rock and Claudette Bradshaw of the Liberal Party of Canada.[19]
Incidents[edit]
The Irving Whale, an oil barge owned by Irving Oil's sister firm J.D. Irving Ltd., was carrying a cargo of 4300 tons of No. 6 fuel oil for Irving Oil when it sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on September 7, 1970, causing a large initial oil spill and subsequent leaks for the next 26 years until it was salvaged by the federal government on July 30, 1996.[20]
On January 4, 1974, 5 people were killed when an Irving Oil gas station east of the Reversing Falls Bridge in Saint John exploded after a transport truck struck a gas tank.[21]
On June 9, 1998, William Hackett, a worker at the Irving Oil Refinery, was killed when a pressurized vessel exploded.[22]
In 2000, a contractor was killed at the Irving Oil Refinery when he fell out of a cherry picker bucket.[23]
On January 30, 2008, Joseph Omer Allain, a construction worker, died at the Canaport LNG facility after falling inside a tank; Canaport LNG is a joint venture between Irving Oil and Repsol.[24]

At the Senate hearing, journalists and academics cited Irving newspapers' lack of critical reporting on the family's influential businesses.[17] In 2015 the Telegraph-Journal published editorials arguing against reconsideration of the tax concessions granted to Irving Oil, without acknowledging the conflict of interest.[18] In 2016, coverage of Saint John Common Council advocacy for higher taxation of Irving Oil's refinery was notably absent from the newspaper, despite extensive coverage in CBC and other news outlets.
There have also been accusations of Irving family political patronage, notably involving Allan Rock and Claudette Bradshaw of the Liberal Party of Canada.[19]
Incidents[edit]
The Irving Whale, an oil barge owned by Irving Oil's sister firm J.D. Irving Ltd., was carrying a cargo of 4300 tons of No. 6 fuel oil for Irving Oil when it sank in the Gulf of St. Lawrence on September 7, 1970, causing a large initial oil spill and subsequent leaks for the next 26 years until it was salvaged by the federal government on July 30, 1996.[20]
On January 4, 1974, 5 people were killed when an Irving Oil gas station east of the Reversing Falls Bridge in Saint John exploded after a transport truck struck a gas tank.[21]
On June 9, 1998, William Hackett, a worker at the Irving Oil Refinery, was killed when a pressurized vessel exploded.[22]
In 2000, a contractor was killed at the Irving Oil Refinery when he fell out of a cherry picker bucket.[23]
On January 30, 2008, Joseph Omer Allain, a construction worker, died at the Canaport LNG facility after falling inside a tank; Canaport LNG is a joint venture between Irving Oil and Repsol.[24]

History[edit]




Original refinery on the east side of Saint John, New Brunswick


Capitalist Kenneth Colin (K.C.) Irving established Irving Oil Limited in 1924, when he was 25 years old. Using gasoline imported by rail, the first retailing location was in Bouctouche, New Brunswick. Irving moved to Saint John to open a Ford dealership and lubricants plant in 1924. The company expanded across the Maritimes through the 1930s, to Quebec in 1940, Newfoundland in 1949, and to Maine in 1972.[1]
In 1977, Irving Oil became the first Canadian oil company to offer unleaded gasoline at its retail outlets. In the late 1990s it became the first oil company in Canada and one of the first in North America to offer gasoline with very low sulphur content, a fact which was recognized by many automobile manufacturers.[2]
Due to its investment in reducing emissions, Irving Oil was one of the few energy companies in Canada to publicly support the Kyoto Accord.[3][4]
Refining[edit]

In 1960 the company partnered with Standard Oil Co. of California (SOCAL) to build the Irving Oil Refinery in the east end of Saint John. Irving bought out SOCAL's share of the refinery in the late 1980s and expanded the facility to become Canada's largest refinery, processing over 300,000 barrels per day (48,000 m3/d). In the late 1990s, the refinery was upgraded to create some of North America's lowest-emission petroleum.
Since 1970 the refinery has been served by the Canaport crude oil receiving terminal southeast of Saint John. In 2009 this facility was expanded to host the Canaport LNG terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG).[5]
Irving Oil announced in fall 2006 that it had purchased more land near Canaport and was examining the feasibility of constructing another 300,000-barrel (48,000 m3) refinery in the area to complement the original modernized 1960s-era refinery in the east end of Saint John; the new refinery was to be named the "Eider Rock Refinery" and was to be built under a partnership between Irving Oil and BP plc.[6] On July 24, 2009 both companies announced that they were indefinitely postponing plans to build the second refinery.[7]
Distribution[edit]

Marine[edit]
Irving Oil's core retail area is in northeast North America and is well served by a network of regional ports and harbours in Atlantic Canada, Quebec and New England - an area that is under-served by pipelines. Consequently, the company economically transports much of its petroleum products to regional distribution terminals at ports throughout the region using its own fleet of coastal tankers.
In the 1990s, Irving Oil also took delivery of several Ultra Large Crude Carriers to deliver crude oil to the Saint John refinery from production locations in Venezuela, the Persian Gulf and the North Sea.
Road[edit]
Irving Oil operates a large fleet of company-branded tanker trucks to deliver petroleum to retail locations from its Saint John refinery as well as the marine distribution terminals. Since the 1970s these semi-trailer tanker trucks were painted a distinctive golden yellow but the fleet underwent a paint scheme change in the 2000s to use white for both cab and trailer. Irving Oil's home heating fuel delivery truck fleet was similarly coloured and is undergoing a paint scheme change.
Sister company J.D. Irving Limited owns and operates RST Industries which provides road tanker transport services for Irving Oil's wholesale deliveries,[8] as well as for jet fuel, marine fuel, liquid asphalt, and other products.
Rail[edit]
Irving Oil once made extensive use of rail service to deliver petroleum from the Saint John refinery to rail-side distribution terminals throughout Atlantic Canada and Quebec. The decline in rural branch rail lines operated by Canadian National Railway and CP Rail in the 1980s and 1990s, combined with the increase of 4-lane highway construction, has seen Irving Oil eliminate practically all retail petroleum delivery by rail and the closure of many of its rail-side distribution terminals in favour of newer highway-served terminals or direct deliveries.
Irving Oil continues to make extensive use of rail service for wholesale petroleum deliveries from its Saint John refinery. Products such as propane, liquid asphalt and diesel are delivered daily to locations in Quebec and New England via New Brunswick Southern Railway, owned by sister company J.D. Irving Limited as well as by CN.

Retail network[edit]

Irving Mainway, Westville, Nova Scotia


Irving Oil operates bulk furnace oil and propane outlets in most major centres across Atlantic Canada, New England and Quebec as well as select locations in eastern Ontario, almost all of which are supplied from its Saint John refinery.
Irving Oil also operates over 900 gas stations in these jurisdictions. In recent decades, smaller stations have been closed and consolidated as newer, larger facilities are constructed - Irving owns many choice real estate locations in communities across northeastern North America, some of which are no longer used for gas retailing, and others being held in speculation of some future need. Older stations are typically franchise operations and still have automobile service and repair shops, which in recent years are branded by Meineke.
Convenience stores[edit]
Most of Irving Oil's corporate owned-and-operated stations also contain convenience stores. These locations operated as simply "Irving" stations until the late 1990s, when the "Mainway" banner ("Marché Mainway" in Quebec) was introduced; "Mainway" being a brand appropriated from one of Irving's U.S. acquisitions. By the early 2000s, 56 of the company's Quebec locations had been leased to the Couche-Tard chain and rebranded accordingly, conversely 60 of Couche-Tard's fueling stations were supplied by Irving fuels and re-branded accordingly. By the mid 2000s, Irving began to renovate and rebrand its old "Mainway" stations under the name "Bluecanoe" as part of the company's modernization plan. The Bluecanoe brand was first introduced in New England and was introduced to some stations in eastern Ontario and the Atlantic provinces; however, many others were not upgraded and retained the older name "Mainway".
On May 8, 2008, Irving announced that they would lease 252 of the "Mainway" and "Bluecanoe" retail stores at its stations in Canada and New England to Alimentation Couche-Tard, which has rebranded all of the stores as Circle K. Irving will continue to own the stations and supply their fuel, the fuel and lubricant brands at these stations will remain "Irving". Irving stations in Quebec retain the "Couche-Tard" banner for the retail stores.
Irving stations in New England often contain an Amato's eXpress, Subway, or Quiznos.
Big Stops[edit]

Irving Oil also operates several "Big Stops", which are truck stops featuring family restaurants, facilities for truck drivers, and convenience stores. These large stations are located at strategic locations throughout New England, the Maritimes, Quebec and Newfoundland.
They occupy several hectares near important highway interchanges and junctions and have been developed since the 1970s; some of the oldest Big Stops are still in operation with the interiors being evocative of that era. These locations, aside from their convenience store operations, continue to be operated by Irving Oil.
In the past decade, Irving Oil has opened several new Big Stops in New Brunswick to reflect the modernized and realigned arterial highway network in that province, and these facilities contain restaurants that have their own name and identity which are often reflective of the local area. The first modern Big Stop is in Salisbury, NB, and its restaurant is called "The Silver Fox"; the second one to open was in Lincoln, NB and has a restaurant called "The Blue Canoe"; the third was in Grand Falls, NB with a restaurant called "The Back Forty"; the most recent is in Enfield, NS with a restaurant called "Crossing" - the original name for the community.

Criticisms[edit]
Examples of vertical integration within the "Irving Group of Companies" (as the Irving family refers to their holdings) include the acquisition or formation of businesses along the entire chain of production, from the Irving refinery (an Irving Oil subsidiary) and its retail outlets, to the transportation subsidiaries of J.D. Irving (RST, Midland, NB Southern, Sunbury), to various construction and engineering companies that assist in building, maintaining and expanding the conglomerate's facilities. Further examples of vertical integration within the conglomerate include Industrial Security Ltd. (ISL), the wholly owned security company that guards facilities, as well as industrial suppliers such as Thornes, Universal Sales and Commercial Equipment Ltd. which provide specialty goods and services to its companies. J.D. Irving, the sister firm to Irving Oil, is a dominant forestry company in northeastern North America, growing trees, harvesting trees and producing lumber, pulp and paper, and various enhanced value products such as magazine grade paper, tissue, and personal care products. JDI also owns Brunswick News which controls most English-language newspapers in New Brunswick.
The City of Saint John, where Irving Oil is located, is closely tied to the Irving Group of Companies, which are mostly headquartered there. In 2005, Irving Oil received a controversial tax break from the municipality to develop the Canaport LNG (liquid natural gas) terminal; it was apparently negotiated one-on-one with the city's then-mayor Norm MacFarlane. The tax concessions have cost the City of Saint John approximately $75 million over ten years, with a potential total loss of over $180 million.[9][10]
The rail tanker explosion in Lac Megantic, Quebec in 2013 increased awareness in Saint John of potential rail safety issues involving Irving Oil crude shipments, since the train that exploded was on its way to the Irving Oil refinery in Saint John.[11] Irving Oil’s siting of a crude oil rail terminal in an east neighbourhood of the city drew heavy criticism from environmentalists and residents.[12] Irving Oil was allowed to establish the terminal without environmental assessments. The facility has since faced complaints regarding air quality and noise.[13][14]
There was also conflict in Saint John over the proposed construction of a natural gas pipeline that was to cross through a major municipal park. However, it is unknown if there would be any health risks to the community.
The Dominion newspaper, an independent Canadian newspaper, has criticized Irving's ownership of the New Brunswick Papers, as well as the papers' journalistic integrity, particularly when reporting on companies controlled by the Irving family such as Irving Oil.[15] Even the Canadian Senate has examined the issue; a report from the Senate in 2006 on media control in Canada singled out New Brunswick because of the Irving companies' ownership of all English-language daily newspapers in the province, including the Telegraph-Journal.

At the Senate hearing, journalists and academics cited Irving newspapers' lack of critical reporting on the family's influential businesses.[17] In 2015 the Telegraph-Journal published editorials arguing against reconsideration of the tax concessions granted to Irving Oil, without acknowledging the conflict of interest.[18] In 2016, coverage of Saint John Common Council advocacy for higher taxation of Irving Oil's refinery was notably absent from the newspaper, despite extensive coverage in CBC and other news outlets.
There have also been accusations of Irving family political patronage, notably involving Allan Rock and Claudette Bradshaw of the Liberal Party of Canada.[19]

On January 4, 1974, 5 people were killed when an Irving Oil gas station east of the Reversing Falls Bridge in Saint John exploded after a transport truck struck a gas tank.[21]
On June 9, 1998, William Hackett, a worker at the Irving Oil Refinery, was killed when a pressurized vessel exploded.[22]
In 2000, a contractor was killed at the Irving Oil Refinery when he fell out of a cherry picker bucket.[23]

Irving tissue plant at Dieppe


Irving Tissue Company Limited is a tissue products producing company, owned by J.D. Irving Limited.[1] It has manufacturing locations in both Canada and the United States.
History[edit]
Irving Tissue was started in 1988 in Saint John, New Brunswick after J.D. Irving acquired a tissue paper mill from Kimberly-Clark in the city's west side (adjacent to Irving Pulp and Paper).[2] Irving began producing tissue for a new subsidiary that was located in Moncton, N.B. and was sold under the marketing name Majesta.
In 1990, J.D. Irving opened a tissue converting plant for Majesta in Dieppe, New Brunswick that would make use of the tissue produced in Saint John. Irving begins producing private label tissue products and the Majesta brand is launched in Canada.[2]
In 1996, Irving acquired another tissue paper mill from Kimberly-Clark as well as a tissue converting plant, both located in Fort Edward, New York. Part of this acquisition saw Irving Tissue receive the right to market its products under the Scotties Facial Tissue brand in the United States.[2]
In 2001, J.D. Irving acquired a tissue production and converting plant in Toronto from Procter & Gamble. This acquisition saw Irving Tissue receive the right to market the Royale brand in Canada.[2]
In 2004, Irving Personal Care opened a New Brunswick plant to produce private label baby diapers and training pants for major North American retailers.[2]
In 2010, major investments in buildings and a new through air dried paper machine at the Irving Tissue site in Fort Edward increases capacity and improves product quality.[2]
Currently, Irving Tissue manufactures products under the Majesta and Royale brands in Canada and the Scotties brand in the United States.[1] Irving Tissue is an unsyndicated company.
