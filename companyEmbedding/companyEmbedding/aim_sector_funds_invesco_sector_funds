Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Fact Sheet








 About risk
			 


Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
Growth Investing Risk. Growth stocks tend to be more expensive relative to the issuing company's earnings or assets compared with other types of stock. As a result, they tend to be more sensitive to changes in, or investors' expectations of, the issuing company's earnings and can be more volatile.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Mid-Capitalization Risk. Mid-capitalization companies tend to be more vulnerable to changing market conditions and may have more limited product lines and markets, less experienced management and fewer financial resources than larger companies. These companies' securities may be more volatile and less liquid than those of more established companies, and their returns may vary, sometimes significantly, from the overall securities market.

Our high-conviction strategies include these distinct approaches





Fundamental active
Portfolio managers choose investments based on the fundamental of a company and its stock or bond.



High conviction means assessing companies on how financially strong they are, not just how big they are.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

* Returns are cumulative for funds with less than one year of performance.

		
		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. 


Performance shown at NAV does not include applicable front-end or CDSC sales charges, which would have reduced the performance.


		
		Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV) and the effect of the maximum sales charge unless otherwise stated.


Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.


1
Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, returns would have been lower.


2 
		
		Although the fund's return during certain periods was positively impacted by its investments in initial public offerings (IPOs), there can be no assurance that the fund will have favorable IPO investment opportunities in the future.


3 
		
		Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares at the target date.


4 
		
		A target date fund identifies a specific time at which investors are expected to begin making withdrawals, e.g., Now, 2020, 2030. The principal value of the fund is not guaranteed at any time, including at the target date.


5 
		
		Performance includes litigation proceeds. Had these proceeds not been received, total return would have been lower.


6 
		
		Class A share performance reflects any applicable fee waivers or expense reimbursements.


7 
		
		Effective July 31, 2013, Invesco Global Quantitative Core Fund was renamed Invesco Global Low Volatility Equity Yield Fund. Performance for the fund prior to July 31 is reflective of the Fund's prior strategy and objective.


8 
		
		On March 12, 2007, the fund reorganized from a Closed-End Fund to an open-end fund. Returns prior to March 12, 2007, are the historical returns of the Closed-End Fund's Common Shares. The Closed-End Fund's Common Shares inception date is May 31, 2002. 


9
The Fund's returns include an adjustment for a one time payment to the Fund by the Advisor. Had this payment to the Fund not been made, the returns would have been lower.


10 
		
		Effective July 31, 2013, Invesco U.S. Quantitative Core Fund was renamed Invesco Low Volatility Equity Yield Fund. Performance for the fund prior to July 31 is reflective of the Fund's prior strategy and objective.

Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, each target fund and acquiring fund file annual and semi-annual reports and
other information with the Commission. You may read and copy any reports, statements, or other
information filed by a target fund or acquiring fund at the Commission�s public reference rooms
at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C., 20549-0213. Please call the Commission at 1 800 SEC 0330
for further information on the public reference room. Filings made with the Commission by either

CORRECTING and REPLACING AIM Investments Announces Final Steps in Creation of a Unified U.S. Retail Brand Name






CORRECTION... by AIM Investments


September 30, 2004 09:49 PM Eastern Daylight Time



				HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 30, 2004--Fifth graph, first sentence of release should read: Also consistent with the integration process, 17 U.S. retail funds bearing the INVESCO name become AIM-branded funds, effective Oct. 15, 2004 (sted Also consistent with the integration process, these 17 U.S. retail funds bearing the INVESCO name become AIM-branded funds, effective Oct. 15, 2004.) In addition, in the "Charting the Changes" table, the name William R. Keithler listed under "Management Team" for INVESCO Technology Fund (new fund name: AIM Technology Fund) should not have the "lead" designation following it; William R. Keithler (sted William R. Keithler (lead)).  The corrected release reads: 

 AIM INVESTMENTS ANNOUNCES FINAL STEPS IN CREATION OF A UNIFIED U.S. RETAIL BRAND NAME  AIM Investments(SM) announced today the final steps to create a unified distribution platform for AIM and INVESCO U.S. retail products, creating a single U.S. retail brand under AIM Investments.  As part of this evolution to unify the U.S. retail brand, which began in March 2003, members of INVESCO's Denver Investment Center will transition to A I M Advisors Inc., effective Oct. 1, 2004. As a result, also effective Oct. 1, 2004, INVESCO Institutional (N.A.), will no longer provide sub-advisory services for INVESCO Advantage Health Sciences Fund, INVESCO Energy Fund, INVESCO Financial Services Fund, INVESCO Gold & Precious Metals Fund, INVESCO Health Sciences Fund, INVESCO Leisure Fund, INVESCO Multi-Sector Fund, INVESCO Small Company Growth Fund, INVESCO Technology Fund, and INVESCO Utilities Fund.  The transition does not impact other retail sub-advisory relationships handled by INVESCO Institutional (N.A.) from its other investment centers in North America, including the following mutual funds also distributed by AIM: AIM Real Estate Fund, INVESCO Core Equity Fund, INVESCO Total Return Fund, INVESCO International Core Equity Fund, AIM Floating Rate Fund, and INVESCO S&P 500 Index Fund.  INVESCO will continue its focus as a high-quality institutional investment manager and sub-adviser in the U.S., where it managed $128 billion in assets as of June 30, 2004.  Also consistent with the integration process, 17 U.S. retail funds bearing the INVESCO name become AIM-branded funds, effective Oct. 15, 2004. Five of these funds also will take on new management teams, effective Oct. 1. The INVESCO VIF funds also will experience similar changes.  Following the March 2003 announcement of AIM and INVESCO's intent to create a single, unified distribution platform for U.S. retail products, A I M Distributors Inc. became the distributor for the INVESCO U.S. retail funds on July 1, 2003. On Nov. 25, 2003, AIM Advisors replaced INVESCO Funds Group Inc. as the investment advisor to all INVESCO U.S. retail funds.  "Our goal since March 2003 has been to simplify our retail business in the U.S. by providing investors with a more comprehensive variety of quality U.S. retail products through one source," said Mark Williamson, president and chief executive officer of AIM Investments. "I believe the completion of this integration allows both AIM and INVESCO to now focus on some of their most recognizable strengths."  The investment professionals in the Denver Investment Center managed approximately $14 billion in assets as of June 30, 2004, primarily through sector-focused funds and small- and mid-cap growth funds.
