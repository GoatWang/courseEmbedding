		Pincus: Payscale Secures $100M Investment
May 1, 2014

Warburg 
		Pincus has agreed to make a majority investment of up to $100 million to 
		recapitalize the Payscale and to fund growth initiatives. 

		Founded in 2000, PayScale offers its customers the world�s largest 
		database of individual compensation profiles, containing more than 40 
		million salary profiles, providing an immediate and precise snapshot of 
		current market salaries through its online tools and software. 
		PayScale�s products are powered by innovative algorithms that 
		dynamically acquire, analyze and aggregate compensation information for 
		millions of individuals in real-time. More than 3,000 of its enterprise 
		subscription customers in 13 countries rely on the company�s products to 
		make salary decisions for more than two million employees.

		"This investment validates PayScale's position as the leading 
		compensation data and SaaS provider enabling businesses to attract, 
		retain and optimize the return on their most important assets, their 
		people," said Mike Metzger, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
		PayScale. �By leveraging Warburg Pincus� expertise, experience and 
		growth capital, we will be able to enhance our product offerings and 
		accelerate our growth."

		�We are excited to partner with Mike and the rest of the PayScale team 
		as they continue to develop and enhance innovative compensation software 
		and data products for customers around the world," said Justin Sadrian, 
		Managing Director, Warburg Pincus. "At a time when businesses 
		increasingly seek sophisticated analytics about employee compensation, 
		PayScale's offerings enable its customers to make better, faster and 
		smarter decisions related to attracting and retaining the talent to 
		power their organizations in a cost-effective manner."


The 
		company anticipates supporting its growth initiatives by hiring to 
		expand its go-to-market and product development teams among other areas.

		�PayScale�s investment from Warburg Pincus is an exciting development 
		for the Seattle tech scene. They are poised to disrupt a key market in 
		human capital management, one of the hottest areas of growth in business 
		software right now,� said Matt McIlwain, Managing Director, Madrona 
		Ventures, a Seattle-based venture capital firm and investor in 
		PayScale�s previous venture investment rounds.

		Raymond James & Associates served as financial advisor to PayScale.

– USA, WA – Avalara, Inc., a leading provider of cloud-based software for sales tax and other transactional tax compliance, today announced it has raised $100 million in a financing round from an affiliate of Warburg Pincus, a global private equity firm focused on growth investing.
Avalara pioneered a leading cloud-based software platform for sales tax automation a decade ago and today delivers a broad and growing array of compliance solutions related to sales tax and other transactional taxes, such as VAT and excise tax. Its end-to-end suite of solutions enables businesses of all sizes to automate the process of determining taxability, identifying applicable tax rates, calculating taxes, preparing and filing returns, remitting taxes, maintaining tax records, and managing tax exemption certificates.
“Warburg Pincus is a world-class private equity firm with significant experience helping companies like Avalara grow into successful businesses of scale,” said Scott McFarlane, founder and CEO of Avalara. “This investment by Warburg Pincus will allow us to put more dollars to work in our growth initiatives. It also validates our fundamental belief that sales tax compliance automation is inevitable, and Avalara is at the forefront of this movement. We look forward to leveraging the expertise and funding of our new partners to accelerate our growth.”
The company’s growth initiatives include international expansion and strategic acquisitions, which will extend the company’s tax content, product and service offerings, customer base, cross-selling opportunities, and geographic reach.
Justin Sadrian, Managing Director at Warburg Pincus and newest member of the Avalara board of directors, commented, “Avalara has secured a leading position in tax software and compliance, bringing new and sophisticated technology solutions to help its customers navigate an increasingly complex regulatory environment. The company fits squarely into our investment thesis of compliance-driven SaaS software and data businesses, and we are incredibly excited to partner with Scott and the talented Avalara team as they continue to build their business and expand their product offerings.”
Including this investment by Warburg Pincus, Avalara has raised more than $200 million in capital since 2004 from a list of investors that includes Sageview Capital and Battery Ventures, as well as other entities and individuals.
Avalara marks Warburg Pincus’ third active technology investment in a company in the Seattle area, following A Place for Mom and, most recently, PayScale (in April 2014). Warburg Pincus previously has invested in the tax software companies Chipsoft, the maker of TurboTax, which was acquired by Intuit, and MLM Information Services/CorpTax, which was acquired by Corporation Service Company (CSC).
In connection with this transaction, DLA Piper LLP (US) acted as legal counsel to Avalara and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP served as legal counsel to Warburg Pincus.

Avalara’s end-to-end suite of solutions is designed to effectively manage complicated and burdensome tax compliance obligations imposed by state, local, and other taxing authorities in the United States and internationally.
