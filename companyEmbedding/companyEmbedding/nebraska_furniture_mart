Electronics rip off
5/9/2011

Guest


                        Bought an hp computer with everything to go with it. Bought an extended warranty for $199.00. Computer defective. Replaced computer. Called Super Techs many times because everything had not been installed on first trip. Printer stopped working. Was told I would have to pay for service because it was a software problem and my extended warranty with Super Techs only covered labor. Was not a software problem. I paid to have Geek Squad come out  instead. It was NOT a software problem. Left word for the salesman to call me so I could tell him we were not happy. Salesman never returned my call. (Big surprise.)
I will continue to call the Geek Squad; Super Techs and Nebraska Furniture Mart ripped me off.
Rose Blumkin must be spinning in her grave.

BAD BUSINESS
1/31/2011

                        I will never make another purchase at NFM. I purchased an expensive electronic item with CASH, and when I tried to return it 3 days later they would not give me my CASH back. Apparently when I gave the sales clerk my phone number my husband's name came up, and she rang it up that way. I guess she couldn't take the time to see I was a WOMAN. Now they will not give me my money back, but of course they would be more than happy to give me store credit. When I said that if I had purchased the item at Best Buy or any other store with CASH I would have gotten my money. Their weak excuse is that these other stores don't care about customer security. WHAT??? I WILL NEVER, EVER PURCHASE ANOTHER ITEM THERE AS LONG AS I LIVE. I will be telling this to all my friends, coworkers and family. Mrs. B must be rolling over in her grave over how the customer is treated now.

NFM does not stand behind products
10/14/2010

Marcia M.


                        Wish Mrs. B still was at NFM.  We bought $2000 worth of appliances from NFM.  The LG washer we purchased has been a lemon from the start.  LG will not stand behind their product, neither will NFM.  I would like to drive this washer to NFM and leave it in the parking lot with a sign. NFM does not stand behind their products.  We will never walk in their store again. We live in Nebraska and have a relation living in Omaha, we will be sure to make this known.

                        I bought a HP computer from NFM in November. It did not work from the beginning. Their solution was to give me the phone number of a fifteen year old kid in India. 

Do not buy anything from NFM.

Nebraska Furniture Mart RULES!

                        NFM is the nation's largest furniture, appliance and electronics store.  They have the best prices in Omaha, which has forced several competitors like CompUSA and Circuit City out of business in Omaha.   Lexi M posted that they carry average items and that the quality isn't the greatest.  Hello?! The Mart doesn't actually build the stuff they sell.  If something is cheap, it's because it's a low cost item.   And better deals can't be found elsewhere.  The Mart shops it's competition and is cheaper.  They haven't been in business since 1938 by being a bunch of screwoffs.

Nebraska Furniture Mart

                        Talk about a huge store, here it is.  Nebraska Furniture Mart has everything that you would need in appliances, electronics, carpet, furniture and more.  I often comb through the Sunday sales and look for hot deals from here.  I like their generous no interest financing options.  The general prices are not the greatest as I can find cheaper items elsewhere.  But if the mart doesn't have it, no place will.

                        Nebraska Furniture Mart has a huge selection of household goods, but they are of average value and brand. Their stores are incredible in size, but many times their prices are higher than their competitiors.  I think the fact that they are a local is appealing, but their quality is not the greatest.  Most often better deals can be found elsewhere.

Big Furniture Store.

                        This store  has alot of furniture. I mean ALOT of furniture, but its so large that it takes a half a day just to walk around it. The parking lot is always super crowded. The store  staff is always hard to find. They appear to be overworked and tense. Not the best shopping experience.

Every thing under the sun for your home

                        Nebraska Furniture Mart has everything you need for your home.
We have made several purchases with them.
They have great financing promotions.
The Sales Associates are very knowledgable on the products they sell. Make sure you have a lot of time because this place is huge and it takes awhile to see everything.

Nebraska Furniture Mart is humongous
8/16/2005

                        Nebraska Furniture Mart is a giant furniture store that carries a vast array of furniture, electronics, appliances, etc.  They will deliver within quite a wide radius and will even deliver down to Kansas City.  Their prices are very competitive and they have plenty of sales people on staff to answer questions or help with ordering the color or style you need.  They also have a scratch and dent store right across the street if you want to get things for an even better bargain.

Awesome Furniture Store

                        No matter what kind of furniture or appliance you are looking for, you will probably find it at the Furniture Mart.  Whether you have $100 or $10,000 to spend to outfit your home, there will be an appropriate piece for you there.   Although some of the pieces are not very expensive, almost everything there is very nice.  The staff is friendly and willing to help, and delivery costs are very reasonable.  We have purchased most of our furniture from them.

Huge selection with great prices!

                        Nebraska Furniture Mart is the kind of store that I can not walk out of without wanting a kazillion things.  From couches to cameras, Nebraska Furniture Mart has all of your furniture and electronic needs covered.  If you plan on visiting for the first time, plan on making an afternoon out of it, and even enjoy lunch at the Burger King located inside the store!  I enjoy Nebraska Furniture Mart mostly because of their competitive prices and knowledgable sales people!  Parking isn't the greatest in the world, but then again a little walking never hurt anyone!  Just about everything is available for same-day pick-up, and the warehouse employees are quick and do a decent job of securing down your merchandise.  All in all, NFM is a pretty awesome store!

If you Need It, This Store Probably Has It

                        You could spend a day or more visiting this complex of a store. There are separate buildings for different products. They are huge also. So, the selection is wide and varied. It is fun to look, dream and plan and the prices are reasonable for the products. There are eating establishments within the "store" and candy stands so you won't go hungry or thirsty as you spend the day there. The sales staff is helpful and know their products.

Great full service store

                        This store offers the full gamut of everything you need for your home. It's more than just furniture. They have electronics, computers, and even See's chocolates, which is a nice treat (best chocolate around, especially the toffee crunch bars!). They deliver regularly to outer areas, having a weekly delivery to my town that is two and a half hours away for example. They have good prices as well and the best selection you'll find anywhere. SO whatever furniture you need, be sure to check there. They have a discount section where you can get great deals on scratch and dents.
