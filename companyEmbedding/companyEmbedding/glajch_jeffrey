      Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and 
      assumptions and are identified by words such as “expects,” “estimates,” 
      “projects,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “could,” and other similar words. 
      All statements addressing operating performance, events, or developments 
      that Graham Corporation expects or anticipates will occur in the future, 
      including but not limited to, statements relating to anticipated 
      revenues, profit margins, foreign sales operations, its strategy to 
      build its global sales representative channel, the effectiveness of 
      automation in expanding its engineering capacity, its ability to improve 
      cost competitiveness, customer preferences, changes in market conditions 
      in the industries in which Graham Corporation operates, changes in 
      general economic conditions and customer behavior and Graham 
      Corporation’s acquisition strategy are forward-looking statements. 
      Because they are forward-looking, they should be evaluated in light of 
      important risk factors and uncertainties. These risk factors and 
      uncertainties are more fully described in Graham Corporation's most 
      recent Annual and Quarterly Reports filed with the Securities and 
      Exchange Commission, including under the heading entitled “Risk 
      Factors.” Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties 
      materialize, or should any of Graham Corporation's underlying 
      assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from 
      those currently anticipated. In addition, undue reliance should not be 
      placed on Graham Corporation's forward-looking statements. Except as 
      required by law, Graham Corporation disclaims any obligation to update 
      or publicly announce any revisions to any of the forward-looking 
      statements contained in this press release.
